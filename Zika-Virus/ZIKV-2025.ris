TI  - 2′, 5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase 2 (OAS2) Inhibits Zika Virus Replication through Activation of Type Ι IFN Signaling Pathway
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Background: 2′, 5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2) has been known as an antiviral interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). However, the role of OAS2 on Zika virus (ZIKV) replication is still unknown. In this study, we sought to explore the effect of OAS2 on ZIKV replication and its underlying mechanism. Methods: We performed RNA-Seq in A549 cells with or without ZIKV infection. OAS2 or RIG-I was overexpressed by plasmid transfection or knocked down by siRNA in A549 cells. Expression levels of mRNA and protein of selected genes were detected by RT-qPCR and Western Blot, respectively. Interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) activity was examined by dual luciferase assay. Results: We found that ZIKV infection induced OAS2 expression through a RIG-I-dependent pathway. OAS2 overexpression inhibited ZIKV replication, while OAS2 knockdown increased ZIKV replication. We observed that OAS2 inhibited ZIKV replication through enhanced IFNβ expression, leading to the activation of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway. Conclusion: ZIKV infection induced OAS2 expression, which in turn exerted its anti-ZIKV activities through the IFN-activated Jak/STAT signaling pathway.

TI  - A conformational selection mechanism of flavivirus NS5 for species-specific STAT2 inhibition
JF  - Communications Biology
VL  - 7
AB  - Flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV), rely on their non-structural protein 5 (NS5) for both replication of viral genome and suppression of host IFN signaling. DENV and ZIKV NS5s were shown to facilitate proteosome-mediated protein degradation of human STAT2 (hSTAT2). However, how flavivirus NS5s have evolved for species-specific IFN-suppression remains unclear. Here we report structure-function characterization of the DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) NS5−hSTAT2 complex. The MTase and RdRP domains of DENV2 NS5 form an extended conformation to interact with the coiled-coil and N-terminal domains of hSTAT2, thereby promoting hSTAT2 degradation in cells. Disruption of the extended conformation of DENV2/ZIKV NS5, but not the alternative compact state, impaired their hSTAT2 binding. Our comparative structural analysis of flavivirus NS5s further reveals a conserved protein-interaction platform with subtle amino-acid variations likely underpinning diverse IFN-suppression mechanisms. Together, this study uncovers a conformational selection mechanism underlying species-specific hSTAT2 inhibition by flavivirus NS5.

TI  - A conserved methyltransferase active site residue of Zika virus NS5 is required for the restriction of STING activation and interferon expression.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 105 2
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging RNA virus and causes major public health events due to its link to severe neurological complications in foetuses and neonates. The cGAS-STING signalling pathway regulates innate immunity and plays an important role in the invasion of DNA and RNA viruses. This study reveals a distinct mechanism by which ZIKV restricts the cGAS-STING signalling to repress IFN-β expression. ZIKV attenuates IFN-β expression induced by DNA viruses (herpes simplex virus type 1, HSV-1) or two double-stranded DNAs (dsDNA90 and HSV120) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Notably, ZIKV NS5, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, was responsible for the repression of IFN-β. NS5 interacts with STING in the cytoplasm, suppresses IRF3 phosphorylation and nucleus localization and promotes the cleavage of STING K48-linked polyubiquitination. Furthermore, the NS5 methyltransferase (MTase) domain interacts with STING to restrict STING-induced IFN-β expression. Interestingly, point mutation analyses of conserved methyltransferase active site residue D146 indicate that it is critical for repressing IFN-β expression induced by STING stimulation in cGAS-STING signalling.

TI  - A CRISPR Activation Screen Identifies an Atypical Rho GTPase That Enhances Zika Viral Entry
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging flavivirus that has caused large-scale epidemics. Infection during pregnancy can lead to neurologic developmental abnormalities in children. There is no approved vaccine or therapy for ZIKV. To uncover cellular pathways required for ZIKV that can be therapeutically targeted, we transcriptionally upregulated all known human coding genes with an engineered CRISPR–Cas9 activation complex in human fibroblasts deficient in interferon (IFN) signaling. We identified Ras homolog family member V (RhoV) and WW domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1) as proviral factors, and found them to play important roles during early ZIKV infection in A549 cells. We then focused on RhoV, a Rho GTPase with atypical terminal sequences and membrane association, and validated its proviral effects on ZIKV infection and virion production in SNB-19 cells. We found that RhoV promotes infection of some flaviviruses and acts at the step of viral entry. Furthermore, RhoV proviral effects depend on the complete GTPase cycle. By depleting Rho GTPases and related proteins, we identified RhoB and Pak1 as additional proviral factors. Taken together, these results highlight the positive role of RhoV in ZIKV infection and confirm CRISPR activation as a relevant method to identify novel host–pathogen interactions.

TI  - A CRISPR Activation Screen Identifies Genes That Protect against Zika Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging vector-borne pathogen causing a febrile disease. ZIKV infection might also trigger Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy, and myelitis. Vertical transmission of ZIKV can cause fetus demise, stillbirth, or severe congenital abnormalities and neurological complications. There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment against ZIKV. We used a genome-wide CRISPR activation screen, where genes are activated from their native promoters to identify host cell factors that protect cells from ZIKV infection or associated cell death. The results provide a better understanding of key host factors that protect cells from ZIKV infection and might assist in identifying novel antiviral targets. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne emerging pathogen causing febrile illness. ZIKV is associated Guillain-Barré syndrome and other neurological complications. Infection during pregnancy is associated with pregnancy complications and developmental and neurological abnormalities collectively defined as congenital Zika syndrome. There is still no vaccine or specific treatment for ZIKV infection. To identify host factors that can rescue cells from ZIKV infection, we used a genome-scale CRISPR activation screen. Our highly ranking hits included a short list of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) previously reported to have antiviral activity. Validation of the screen results highlighted interferon lambda 2 (IFN-λ2) and interferon alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) as genes providing high levels of protection from ZIKV. Activation of these genes had an effect on an early stage in viral infection. In addition, infected cells expressing single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for both of these genes displayed lower levels of cell death than did the controls. Furthermore, the identified genes were significantly induced in ZIKV-infected placenta explants. Thus, these results highlight a set of ISGs directly relevant for rescuing cells from ZIKV infection or its associated cell death and substantiate CRISPR activation screens as a tool to identify host factors impeding pathogen infection. IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging vector-borne pathogen causing a febrile disease. ZIKV infection might also trigger Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy, and myelitis.

TI  - A CRISPR screen defines a signal peptide processing pathway required by flaviviruses
JF  - Nature
VL  - 535
SP  - 164
EP  - 168
AB  - Flaviviruses infect hundreds of millions of people annually, and no antiviral therapy is available. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screen to identify host genes that, when edited, resulted in reduced flavivirus infection. Here, we validated nine human genes required for flavivirus infectivity, and these were associated with endoplasmic reticulum functions including translocation, protein degradation, and N-linked glycosylation. In particular, a subset of endoplasmic reticulum-associated signal peptidase complex (SPCS) proteins was necessary for proper cleavage of the flavivirus structural proteins (prM and E) and secretion of viral particles. Loss of SPCS1 expression resulted in markedly reduced yield of all Flaviviridae family members tested (West Nile, dengue, Zika, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and hepatitis C viruses), but had little impact on alphavirus, bunyavirus, or rhabdovirus infection or the surface expression or secretion of diverse host proteins. We found that SPCS1 dependence could be bypassed by replacing the native prM protein leader sequences with a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen leader sequence. Thus, SPCS1, either directly or indirectly via its interactions with host proteins, preferentially promotes the processing of specific protein cargo, and Flaviviridae have a unique dependence on this signal peptide processing pathway. SPCS1 and other signal processing pathway members could represent pharmacological targets for inhibiting infection by the expanding number of flaviviruses of medical concern.

TI  - A CRISPR screen identifies IFI6 as an ER-resident interferon effector that blocks flavivirus replication
JF  - Nature Microbiology
VL  - 3
SP  - 1214
EP  - 1223
AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an architecturally diverse organelle that serves as a membrane source for the replication of multiple viruses. Flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus and Zika virus, induce unique single-membrane ER invaginations that house the viral replication machinery1. Whether this virus-induced ER remodelling is vulnerable to antiviral pathways is unknown. Here, we show that flavivirus replication at the ER is targeted by the interferon (IFN) response. Through genome-scale CRISPR screening, we uncovered an antiviral mechanism mediated by a functional gene pairing between IFI6 (encoding IFN-α-inducible protein 6), an IFN-stimulated gene cloned over 30 years ago2, and HSPA5, which encodes the ER-resident heat shock protein 70 chaperone BiP. We reveal that IFI6 is an ER-localized integral membrane effector that is stabilized through interactions with BiP. Mechanistically, IFI6 prophylactically protects uninfected cells by preventing the formation of virus-induced ER membrane invaginations. Notably, IFI6 has little effect on other mammalian RNA viruses, including the related Flaviviridae family member hepatitis C virus, which replicates in double-membrane vesicles that protrude outwards from the ER. These findings support a model in which the IFN response is armed with a membrane-targeted effector that discriminately blocks the establishment of virus-specific ER microenvironments that are required for replication. Flavivirus replication at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is targeted by the interferon response through blocking of the formation of virus-induced ER membrane invaginations by the interferon-stimulated gene IFI6, encoding an ER-localized integral membrane effector.

TI  - A functional interaction between GRP78 and Zika virus E protein
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that has caused significant public health concerns around the world, partly because of an association with microcephaly in babies born to mothers who were infected with ZIKV during pregnancy. As a recently emerging virus, little is known as to how the virus interacts with the host cell machinery. A yeast-2-hybrid screen for proteins capable of interacting with the ZIKV E protein domain III, the domain responsible for receptor binding, identified 21 proteins, one of which was the predominantly ER resident chaperone protein GRP78. The interaction of GRP78 and ZIKV E was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, and indirect immunofluorescence staining showed intracellular and extracellular co-localization between GRP78 and ZIKV E. Antibodies directed against the N-terminus of GRP78 were able to inhibit ZIKV entry to host cells, resulting in significant reductions in the levels of ZIKV infection and viral production. Consistently, these reductions were also observed after down-regulation of GRP78 by siRNA. These results indicate that GRP78 can play a role mediating ZIKV binding, internalization and replication in cells. GRP78 is a main regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and the study showed that expression of GRP78 was up-regulated, and the UPR was activated. Increases in CHOP expression, and activation of caspases 7 and 9 were also shown in response to ZIKV infection. Overall these results indicate that the interaction between GRP78 and ZIKV E protein plays an important role in ZIKV infection and replication, and may be a potential therapeutic target.

TI  - A Genome-Wide CRISPR-Cas9 Screen Identifies the Dolichol-Phosphate Mannose Synthase Complex as a Host Dependency Factor for Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - Dengue disease, which is caused by dengue virus (DENV), has emerged as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in humans and is a major global health concern. DENV encodes only few proteins and relies on the host cell machinery to accomplish its life cycle. The identification of the host factors important for DENV infection is needed to propose new targets for antiviral intervention. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identified DPM1 and -3, two subunits of the DPMS complex, as important host factors for the replication of DENV as well as other related viruses such as Zika virus. We established that DPMS complex plays dual roles during viral infection, both regulating viral RNA replication and promoting viral structural glycoprotein folding/stability. These results provide insights into the host molecules exploited by DENV and other flaviviruses to facilitate their life cycle. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for dengue disease, a major human health concern for which no specific therapies are available. Like other viruses, DENV relies heavily on the host cellular machinery for productive infection. In this study, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen using haploid HAP1 cells to identify host genes important for DENV infection. We identified DPM1 and -3, two subunits of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident dolichol-phosphate mannose synthase (DPMS) complex, as host dependency factors for DENV and other related flaviviruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV). The DPMS complex catalyzes the synthesis of dolichol-phosphate mannose (DPM), which serves as mannosyl donor in pathways leading to N-glycosylation, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis, and C- or O-mannosylation of proteins in the ER lumen. Mutation in the DXD motif of DPM1, which is essential for its catalytic activity, abolished DPMS-mediated DENV infection. Similarly, genetic ablation of ALG3, a mannosyltransferase that transfers mannose to lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO), rendered cells poorly susceptible to DENV. We also established that in cells deficient for DPMS activity, viral RNA amplification is hampered and truncated oligosaccharides are transferred to the viral prM and E glycoproteins, affecting their proper folding. Overall, our study provides new insights into the host-dependent mechanisms of DENV infection and supports current therapeutic approaches using glycosylation inhibitors to treat DENV infection. IMPORTANCE Dengue disease, which is caused by dengue virus (DENV), has emerged as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in humans and is a major global health concern.

TI  - A global lipid map defines a network essential for Zika virus replication
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), an arbovirus of global concern, remodels intracellular membranes to form replication sites. How ZIKV dysregulates lipid networks to allow this, and consequences for disease, is poorly understood. Here, we perform comprehensive lipidomics to create a lipid network map during ZIKV infection. We find that ZIKV significantly alters host lipid composition, with the most striking changes seen within subclasses of sphingolipids. Ectopic expression of ZIKV NS4B protein results in similar changes, demonstrating a role for NS4B in modulating sphingolipid pathways. Disruption of sphingolipid biosynthesis in various cell types, including human neural progenitor cells, blocks ZIKV infection. Additionally, the sphingolipid ceramide redistributes to ZIKV replication sites, and increasing ceramide levels by multiple pathways sensitizes cells to ZIKV infection. Thus, we identify a sphingolipid metabolic network with a critical role in ZIKV replication and show that ceramide flux is a key mediator of ZIKV infection. Zika virus (ZIKV) remodels intracellular membranes for replication, but the role of different lipid types for infection and disease is unclear. Here, the authors perform lipidomics, show perturbation of the lipid network during ZIKV infection and show that ceramides are important for ZIKV infection.

TI  - A global map of the Zika virus phosphoproteome reveals host-driven regulation of viral budding
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Flaviviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that cause millions of infections in the human population annually. Although Zika virus (ZIKV) had been detected in humans as early as the 1950s, its reemergence in South America in 2015 resulted in a global health crisis. While flaviviruses encode 10 proteins that can be post-translationally modified by host enzymes, little is known regarding post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the flavivirus proteome. We used mass spectrometry to comprehensively identify host-driven PTMs on the ZIKV proteome. This approach allowed us to identify 43 PTMs across 8 ZIKV proteins, including several that are highly conserved within the Flavivirus genus. Notably, we found two phosphosites on the ZIKV envelope protein that are functionally important for viral propagation and appear to regulate viral budding. Additionally, we discovered 115 host kinases that interacted with ZIKV proteins and determined that Bosutinib, an FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets ZIKV interacting host kinases, impairs ZIKV growth. Thus, we have defined a high-resolution map of host-driven PTMs on ZIKV proteins as well as cellular interacting kinases, uncovered a novel mechanism of host driven-regulation of ZIKV budding, and identified an FDA-approved inhibitor of ZIKV growth.

TI  - A Human and Rhesus Macaque Interferon-Stimulated Gene Screen Shows That Over-Expression of ARHGEF3/XPLN Inhibits Replication of Hepatitis C Virus and Other Flavivirids
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Natural hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is restricted to humans, whereas other primates such as rhesus macaques are non-permissive for infection. To identify human and rhesus macaque genes that differ or share the ability to inhibit HCV replication, we conducted a medium-throughput screen of lentivirus-expressed host genes that disrupt replication of HCV subgenomic replicon RNA expressing secreted Gaussia luciferase. A combined total of >800 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were screened. Our findings confirmed established anti-HCV ISGs, such as IRF1, PKR and DDX60. Novel species–specific inhibitors were also identified and independently validated. Using a cell-based system that recapitulates productive HCV infection, we identified that over-expression of the ‘Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 3’ gene (ARHGEF3) from both species inhibits full-length virus replication. Additionally, replication of two mosquito-borne flaviviruses, yellow fever virus (YFV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), were also reduced in cell lines over-expressing ARHGEF3 compared to controls. In conclusion, we ascribe novel antiviral activity to the cellular gene ARHGEF3 that inhibits replication of HCV and other important human viral pathogens belonging to the Flaviviridae, and which is conserved between humans and rhesus macaques.

TI  - A limited role for autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Macroautophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It can additionally function as an innate immune response to viral infection as has been demonstrated for a number of arthropod-borne (arbo-) viruses. Arboviruses are maintained in a transmission cycle between vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors yet the majority of studies assessing autophagy-arbovirus interactions have been limited to the mammalian host. Therefore we evaluated the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection of the invertebrate vector using the tractable Aag2 Aedes aegypti mosquito cell culture system. Our data demonstrates that autophagy is significantly induced in mosquito cells upon infection with two flaviviruses, dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), as well as an unrelated mosquito-borne virus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV; Togaviridae). While assessing the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection, we observed a somewhat paradoxical outcome. Both induction and suppression of autophagy via torin 1 and spautin-1, respectively, resulted in increased viral titers for all three viruses, yet suppression of autophagy-related genes had no effect. Interestingly, chemical modulators of autophagy had either no effect or opposite effects in another widely used mosquito cell line, C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells. Together, our data reveals a limited role for autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells. Further, our findings suggest that commonly used chemical modulators of autophagy alter mosquito cells in such a way as to promote viral replication; however, it is unclear if this occurs directly through autophagic manipulation or other means. Author Summary Arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses, specifically those transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, cause significant morbidity and mortality and pose a continued public health threat worldwide. Many of these viruses lack vaccines or therapeutics and current mosquito control strategies are underperforming. For these reasons, identifying vulnerabilities within the transmission cycle that can be targeted will be critical to the development of novel control interventions. Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular pathway and previous studies manipulating this pathway have shown promise in minimizing viral infections in mammalian hosts. In this study we examined arbovirus-autophagy interactions within vector mosquitoes. The goal was to elucidate the role of autophagy during infection of mosquitoes in hopes of identifying critical interactions that can be targeted by novel approaches to block infection of and transmission by vector mosquitoes.

TI  - A Lipidomics Approach in the Characterization of Zika-Infected Mosquito Cells: Potential Targets for Breaking the Transmission Cycle
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 11
AB  - Recent outbreaks of Zika virus in Oceania and Latin America, accompanied by unexpected clinical complications, made this infection a global public health concern. This virus has tropism to neural tissue, leading to microcephaly in newborns in a significant proportion of infected mothers. The clinical relevance of this infection, the difficulty to perform accurate diagnosis and the small amount of data in literature indicate the necessity of studies on Zika infection in order to characterize new biomarkers of this infection and to establish new targets for viral control in vertebrates and invertebrate vectors. Thus, this study aims at establishing a lipidomics profile of infected mosquito cells compared to a control group to define potential targets for viral control in mosquitoes. Thirteen lipids were elected as specific markers for Zika virus infection (Brazilian strain), which were identified as putatively linked to the intracellular mechanism of viral replication and/or cell recognition. Our findings bring biochemical information that may translate into useful targets for breaking the transmission cycle.

TI  - A mosquito salivary protein promotes flavivirus transmission by activation of autophagy
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 11
AB  - Transmission from an infected mosquito to a host is an essential process in the life cycle of mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Numerous studies have demonstrated that mosquito saliva facilitates viral transmission. Here we find that a saliva-specific protein, named Aedes aegypti venom allergen-1 (AaVA-1), promotes dengue and Zika virus transmission by activating autophagy in host immune cells of the monocyte lineage. The AG6 mice (ifnar1–/–ifngr1–/–) bitten by the virus-infected AaVA-1-deficient mosquitoes present a lower viremia and prolonged survival. AaVA-1 intracellularly interacts with a dominant negative binder of Beclin-1, known as leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (LRPPRC), and releases Beclin-1 from LRPPRC-mediated sequestration, thereby enabling the initialization of downstream autophagic signaling. A deficiency in Beclin-1 reduces viral infection in mice and abolishes AaVA-1-mediated enhancement of ZIKV transmission by mosquitoes. Our study provides a mechanistic insight into saliva-aided viral transmission and could offer a potential prophylactic target for reducing flavivirus transmission. Mosquito saliva affects transmission of flaviviruses, but underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, the authors show that Aedes aegypti venom allergen-1 (AaVA-1) promotes dengue and Zika virus transmission by activating autophagy in host immune cells of the monocyte lineage.

TI  - A mosquito salivary protein-driven influx of myeloid cells facilitates flavivirus transmission
JF  - The EMBO Journal
VL  - 43
SP  - 1690
EP  - 1721
AB  - Mosquitoes transmit many disease-relevant flaviviruses. Efficient viral transmission to mammalian hosts requires mosquito salivary factors. However, the specific salivary components facilitating viral transmission and their mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. Here, we show that a female mosquito salivary gland-specific protein, here named A. aegypti Neutrophil Recruitment Protein (AaNRP), facilitates the transmission of Zika and dengue viruses. AaNRP promotes a rapid influx of neutrophils, followed by virus-susceptible myeloid cells toward mosquito bite sites, which facilitates establishment of local infection and systemic dissemination. Mechanistically, AaNRP engages TLR1 and TLR4 of skin-resident macrophages and activates MyD88-dependent NF-κB signaling to induce the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants. Inhibition of MyD88-NF-κB signaling with the dietary phytochemical resveratrol reduces AaNRP-mediated enhancement of flavivirus transmission by mosquitoes. These findings exemplify how salivary components can aid viral transmission, and suggest a potential prophylactic target.

TI  - A Mutation Identified in Neonatal Microcephaly Destabilizes Zika Virus NS1 Assembly in Vitro
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - An unprecedented epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection had spread to South and Central America. ZIKV infection was recently confirmed by CDC (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to cause neonatal microcephaly, which posed a significant public health emergency of international concern. No specific vaccines or drugs are currently available to fight ZIKV infection. ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) plays an essential role in viral replication and immune evasion. We determined the crystal structure of ZIKV NS1172–352, which forms a head-to-head, symmetric dimer with a unique 14-stranded β-ladder conserved among flaviviruses. The assembly of the β-ladder dimer is concentration dependent. Strikingly, one pathogenic mutation T233A (NCBI accession no. KU527068), found in the brain tissue of infected fetus with neonatal microcephaly, is located at the dimer interface. Thr233, a unique residue found in ZIKV but not in other flaviviruses, organizes a central hydrogen bonding network at NS1 dimer interface. Mutation of Thr233 to Ala disrupts this elaborated interaction network, and destabilizes the NS1 dimeric assembly in vitro. In addition, our structural comparison of epitopes for protective antibody 22NS1, targeting West Nile Virus NS1, could potentially be valuable in understanding its anti-virus specificities and in the development of antibodies against ZIKV.

TI  - A natural polymorphism in Zika virus NS2A protein responsible of virulence in mice
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 9
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is currently one of the major concerns in human public health due to its association with neurological disorders. Intensive effort has been implemented for the treatment of ZIKV, however there are not currently approved vaccines or antivirals available to combat ZIKV infection. In this sense, the identification of virulence factors associated with changes in ZIKV virulence could help to develop safe and effective countermeasures to treat ZIKV or to prevent future outbreaks. Here, we have compared the virulence of two related ZIKV strains from the recent outbreak in Brazil (2015), Rio Grande do Norte Natal (RGN) and Paraiba. In spite of both viruses being identified in the same period of time and region, significant differences in virulence and replication were observed using a validated mouse model of ZIKV infection. While ZIKV-RGN has a 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD50) of ~105 focus forming units (FFUs), ZIKV-Paraiba infection resulted in 100% of lethality with less than 10 FFUs. Combining deep-sequencing analysis and our previously described infectious ZIKV-RGN cDNA clone, we identified a natural polymorphism in the non-structural protein 2 A (NS2A) that increase the virulence of ZIKV. Moreover, results demonstrate that the single amino acid alanine to valine substitution at position 117 (A117V) in the NS2A was sufficient to convert the attenuated rZIKV-RGN in a virulent Paraiba-like virus (MLD50 < 10 FFU). The mechanism of action was also evaluated and data indicate that substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A protein reduces host innate immune responses and viral-induced apoptosis in vitro. Therefore, amino acid substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A could be used as a genetic risk-assessment marker for future ZIKV outbreaks.

TI  - A naturally isolated symbiotic bacterium suppresses flavivirus transmission by Aedes mosquitoes
JF  - Science
VL  - 384
AB  - The commensal microbiota of the mosquito gut plays a complex role in determining the vector competence for arboviruses. In this study, we identified a bacterium from the gut of field Aedes albopictus mosquitoes named Rosenbergiella sp. YN46 (Rosenbergiella_YN46) that rendered mosquitoes refractory to infection with dengue and Zika viruses. Inoculation of 1.6 × 103 colony forming units (CFUs) of Rosenbergiella_YN46 into A. albopictus mosquitoes effectively prevents viral infection. Mechanistically, this bacterium secretes glucose dehydrogenase (RyGDH), which acidifies the gut lumen of fed mosquitoes, causing irreversible conformational changes in the flavivirus envelope protein that prevent viral entry into cells. In semifield conditions, Rosenbergiella_YN46 exhibits effective transstadial transmission in field mosquitoes, which blocks transmission of dengue virus by newly emerged adult mosquitoes. The prevalence of Rosenbergiella_YN46 is greater in mosquitoes from low-dengue areas (52.9 to ~91.7%) than in those from dengue-endemic regions (0 to ~6.7%). Rosenbergiella_YN46 may offer an effective and safe lead for flavivirus biocontrol. Editor’s summary Flavivirus diseases are increasing in incidence and prevalence owing to the urban proclivities of its Aedes mosquito vector species. Extirpation of mosquitoes is considered key for the control of several human diseases but often involves toxic chemicals that prompt mosquito resistance. As some biocontrol alternatives look promising in malaria campaigns, Zhang et al. examined the microbiota of Aedes mosquitoes for potential agents to control dengue and Zika virus transmission. The authors isolated a bacterium called Rosenbergiella_YN46 in Aedes albopictus mosquitos. The bacterium was fed to caged mosquitoes to establish stable gut infections, and it was found to prevent the insects from being infected by viruses and blocked viral transmission to mice. —Caroline Ash INTRODUCTION Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, cause several potentially fatal human viral infections. Increasing flaviviral transmission and outbreaks have become major public health concerns worldwide. However, safe and effective prophylactics and therapeutics are still lacking. Viral particles are ingested by mosquitoes during blood feeding on wild vertebrates, livestock, and humans. Viruses enter the mosquito gut epithelial cells and infect hemocoel tissues, subsequently migrating to the salivary glands, from which they are transmitted to a human or other vertebrate during the mosquito’s next blood meal. The mosquito gut thus regulates the transmission of viruses acquired in a blood meal. Hence, the interaction between the mosquito gut and viruses is a target for flavivirus control strategies. RATIONALE The rich commensal mosquito microbiota plays intricate roles in determining vector competence for viruses. Thus, the mosquito gut microbiota is considered a key determinant of flavivirus infection and transmission. Because of their hosts’ complex life histories, the wider environment also plays a crucial role in shaping the microbial community structure of adult mosquitoes. Gut bacteria may be acquired by vertical transmission from female mosquitoes to offspring, and they can also be horizontally acquired during feeding of the aquatic mosquito larvae and flying adult stages. Mosquitoes emerging from different habitats may therefore harbor different compositions of gut microbiota, endowing their insect hosts with different traits including vector competence. RESULTS In this study, we isolated 55 cultivable bacteria from the guts of field-caught Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, the primary vector of dengue virus in Yunnan Province, China. Gut colonization by a Rosenbergiella bacterium, named Rosenbergiella_YN46, enables both A. albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to resist DENV and ZIKV infection. Furthermore, Rosenbergiella_YN46 persistently resides in the guts of Aedes mosquitoes. Mechanistically, Rosenbergiella_YN46 inhibits flavivirus infection of the gut epithelium by secreting a glucose dehydrogenase (RyGDH). During blood feeding, RyGDH effectively converts glucose into gluconic acid, rapidly acidifying the lumen of the mosquito gut (pH ≈ 6.0). This acidic environment inactivates flavivirus virions and disables viral invasion into gut epithelial cells. We found that the prevalence of Rosenbergiella_YN46 largely varied among A. albopictus populations from different locations in Yunnan. Mosquitoes from Wenshan and Puer, which report few local dengue cases, were more likely to have Rosenbergiella_YN46 in their guts than were those from dengue-endemic Xishuangbanna and Lincang. Under semifield conditions, Rosenbergiella_YN46 exhibited effective transstadial transmission in field mosquitoes, which blocked the transmission of DENV2 by newly emerged adult mosquitoes. Rosenbergiella bacteria were widely distributed in the floral nectar of insect-pollinated plants and possibly represent a low-impact strategy for DENV control. CONCLUSION The floral nectar–associated gut bacterium Rosenbergiella_YN46 in field A. albopictus mosquitoes from Yunnan Province, China, protects mosquitoes from flavivirus infection by acidifying the insect gut lumen. Rosenbergiella_YN46 is highly prevalent in the guts of mosquitoes in low dengue–incidence locations. It can be transmitted transstadially to A. albopictus under field-like conditions and blocks dengue acquisition by adults, suggesting that this bacterium may be introduced into mosquito populations in dengue-endemic areas to reduce virus transmission. This study shows that the use of Rosenbergiella_YN46–colonized field mosquitoes may offer a feasible biocontrol strategy for reducing flavivirus transmission and prevalence in nature. A naturally occurring bacterium, Rosenbergiella_YN46, blocks flavivirus transmission by Aedes mosquitoes. (I) Rosenbergiella_YN46 inhibits flavivirus infection in Aedes mosquitoes by secreting glucose dehydrogenase, which acidifies the gut lumen and inactivates viral envelope proteins. (II) Field surveillance reveals a greater prevalence of Rosenbergiella_YN46 in areas with low dengue incidence than in dengue-endemic regions. (III) Under semifield conditions, Rosenbergiella_YN46 demonstrates efficient transstadial transmission in field mosquitoes, thereby preventing DENV transmission by newly emerged adult mosquitoes.

TI  - A Novel Agonist of the TRIF Pathway Induces a Cellular State Refractory to Replication of Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue Viruses
JF  - mBio
VL  - 8
AB  - ABSTRACT The ongoing concurrent outbreaks of Zika, Chikungunya, and dengue viruses in Latin America and the Caribbean highlight the need for development of broad-spectrum antiviral treatments. The type I interferon (IFN) system has evolved in vertebrates to generate tissue responses that actively block replication of multiple known and potentially zoonotic viruses. As such, its control and activation through pharmacological agents may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for simultaneously impairing growth of multiple virus types and rendering host populations resistant to virus spread. In light of this strategy’s potential, we undertook a screen to identify novel interferon-activating small molecules. Here, we describe 1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-(5-isopropyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)-1,2-dihydrochromeno[2,3-c]pyrrole-3,9-dione, which we termed AV-C. Treatment of human cells with AV-C activates innate and interferon-associated responses that strongly inhibit replication of Zika, Chikungunya, and dengue viruses. By utilizing genome editing, we investigated the host proteins essential to AV-C-induced cellular states. This showed that the compound requires a TRIF-dependent signaling cascade that culminates in IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent expression and secretion of type I interferon to elicit antiviral responses. The other canonical IRF3-terminal adaptor proteins STING and IPS-1/MAVS were dispensable for AV-C-induced phenotypes. However, our work revealed an important inhibitory role for IPS-1/MAVS, but not TRIF, in flavivirus replication, implying that TRIF-directed viral evasion may not occur. Additionally, we show that in response to AV-C, primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines that are linked with establishment of adaptive immunity to viral pathogens. Ultimately, synthetic innate immune activators such as AV-C may serve multiple therapeutic purposes, including direct antimicrobial responses and facilitation of pathogen-directed adaptive immunity. IMPORTANCE The type I interferon system is part of the innate immune response that has evolved in vertebrates as a first line of broad-spectrum immunological defense against an unknowable diversity of microbial, especially viral, pathogens. Here, we characterize a novel small molecule that artificially activates this response and in so doing generates a cellular state antagonistic to growth of currently emerging viruses: Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, and dengue virus. We also show that this molecule is capable of eliciting cellular responses that are predictive of establishment of adaptive immunity. As such, this agent may represent a powerful and multipronged therapeutic tool to combat emerging and other viral diseases.

TI  - A Novel Mechanism for Zika Virus Host-Cell Binding
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) recently emerged in the Western Hemisphere with previously unrecognized or unreported clinical presentations. Here, we identify two putative binding mechanisms of ancestral and emergent ZIKV strains featuring the envelope (E) protein residue asparagine 154 (ASN154) and viral phosphatidylserine (PS). Synthetic peptides representing the region containing ASN154 from strains PRVABC59 (Puerto Rico 2015) and MR_766 (Uganda 1947) were exposed to neuronal cells and fibroblasts to model ZIKV E protein/cell interactions and bound MDCK or Vero cells and primary neurons significantly. Peptides significantly inhibited Vero cell infectivity by ZIKV strains MR_766 and PRVABC59, indicating that this region represents a putative binding mechanism of ancestral African ZIKV strains and emergent Western Hemisphere strains. Pretreatment of ZIKV strains MR_766 and PRVABC59 with the PS-binding protein annexin V significantly inhibited replication of PRVABC59 but not MR_766, suggesting that Western hemisphere strains may additionally be capable of utilizing PS-mediated entry to infect host cells. These data indicate that the region surrounding E protein ASN154 is capable of binding fibroblasts and primary neuronal cells and that PS-mediated entry may be a secondary mechanism for infectivity utilized by Western Hemisphere strains.

TI  - A Novel Role for the Regulatory Nod-Like Receptor NLRP12 in Anti-Dengue Virus Response
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue Virus (DENV) infection can cause severe illness such as highly fatality dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Innate immune activation by Nod-like receptors (NLRs) is a critical part of host defense against viral infection. Here, we revealed a key mechanism of NLRP12-mediated regulation in DENV infection. Firstly, NLRP12 expression was inhibited in human macrophage following DENV or other flaviviruses (JEV, YFV, ZIKV) infection. Positive regulatory domain 1 (PRDM1) was induced by DENV or poly(I:C) and suppressed NLRP12 expression, which was dependent on TBK-1/IRF3 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Moreover, NLRP12 inhibited DENV and other flaviviruses (JEV, YFV, ZIKV) replication, which relied on the well-conserved nucleotide binding structures of its NACHT domain. Furthermore, NLRP12 could interact with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) dependent on its Walker A and Walker B sites. In addition, NLRP12 enhanced the production of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFITM3, TRAIL and Viperin. Inhibition of HSP90 with 17-DMAG impaired the upregulation of type I IFNs and ISGs induced by NLRP12. Taken together, we demonstrated a novel mechanism that NLRP12 exerted anti-viral properties in DENV and other flaviviruses (JEV, YFV, ZIKV) infection, which brings up a potential target for the treatment of DENV infection.

VL  - 92

EP  - 1850
AB  - The global threat of the Zika virus to humanity is real. Innovative and potent anti‐Zika virus drugs are still at large, due to the lack of anti‐Zika virus drugs that have passed phase 1 trials. Experimental research has revealed novel inhibitors of Zika virus NS5 methyltransferase enzyme. This study has taken a step further to provide insight into the molecular dynamics of Zika virus and inhibitor binding, which have not been established experimentally. Movements of the methyltransferase binding site loops have a large role to play in the methylation of the viral mRNA cap, which is essential for Zika virus replication. Here, we pinpoint the binding interactions between each potential inhibitor and the methyltransferase, residues that are responsible for binding, as well as which inhibitor‐bound complex renders the methyltransferase more stable. We also highlight the conformational changes that occur within the methyltransferase to accommodate binding of inhibitors and consequences of those changes upon the RNA‐ and cap‐binding sites in the methyltransferase. This research will improve the understanding of the Zika virus NS5 methyltransferase enzyme, and will be beneficial in driving the development of anti‐Zika virus drugs.

TI  - A Possible Association Between Zika Virus Infection and CDK5RAP2 Mutation
JF  - Frontiers in Genetics
VL  - 12
AB  - Introduction Flaviviridae family belongs to the Spondweni serocomplex, which is mainly transmitted by vectors from the Aedes genus. Zika virus (ZIKV) is part of this genus. It was initially reported in Brazil in December 2014 as an unknown acute generalized exanthematous disease and was subsequently identified as ZIKV infection. ZIKV became widespread all over Brazil and was linked with potential cases of microcephaly. Case report We report a case of a 28-year-old Colombian woman, who came to the Obstetric Department with an assumed conglomerate of fetal abnormalities detected via ultrasonography, which was performed at 29.5 weeks of gestation. The patient presented with multiple abnormalities, which range from a suggested Arnold–Chiari malformation, compromising the lateral and third ventricles, liver calcifications, bilateral pyelocalic dilatations, other brain anomalies, and microcephaly. At 12 weeks of gestation, the vertical transmission of ZIKV was suspected. At 38.6 weeks of gestation, the newborn was delivered, with the weight in the 10th percentile (3,180 g), height in the 10th percentile (48 cm), and cephalic circumference under the 2nd percentile (31 cm). Due to the physical findings, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, revealing a small and deviated brain stem, narrowing of the posterior fossa, a giant posterior fossa cyst with ventricular dilatation, a severe cortical and white matter thinning, cerebellar vermis with hypoplasia, and superior and lateral displacement of the cerebellum. In addition, hydrocephalus was displayed by the axial sequence, and the cerebral cortex was also compromised with lissencephaly. Schizencephaly was found with left frontal open-lip, and no intracranial calcifications were found. Two novel heterozygous nonsense mutations were identified using whole-exome sequencing, and both are located in exon 8 under the affection of ZIKV congenital syndrome (CZS) that produced a premature stop codon resulting in the truncation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 2 (CDK5RAP2) protein. Conclusion We used molecular and microbiological assessments to report the initial case of vertically transmitted ZIKV infection with congenital syndrome associated with a neurological syndrome, where a mutation in the CDK5RAP2 gene was also identified. The CDK5RAP2 gene encodes a pericentriolar protein that intervenes in microtubule nucleation and centriole attachment. Diallelic mutation has previously been associated with primary microcephaly.

TI  - A Review: Aedes-Borne Arboviral Infections, Controls and Wolbachia-Based Strategies
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 9
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses (Arboviruses) continue to generate significant health and economic burdens for people living in endemic regions. Of these viruses, some of the most important (e.g., dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever virus), are transmitted mainly by Aedes mosquitoes. Over the years, viral infection control has targeted vector population reduction and inhibition of arboviral replication and transmission. This control includes the vector control methods which are classified into chemical, environmental, and biological methods. Some of these control methods may be largely experimental (both field and laboratory investigations) or widely practised. Perceptively, one of the biological methods of vector control, in particular, Wolbachia-based control, shows a promising control strategy for eradicating Aedes-borne arboviruses. This can either be through the artificial introduction of Wolbachia, a naturally present bacterium that impedes viral growth in mosquitoes into heterologous Aedes aegypti mosquito vectors (vectors that are not natural hosts of Wolbachia) thereby limiting arboviral transmission or via Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which naturally harbour Wolbachia infection. These strategies are potentially undermined by the tendency of mosquitoes to lose Wolbachia infection in unfavourable weather conditions (e.g., high temperature) and the inhibitory competitive dynamics among co-circulating Wolbachia strains. The main objective of this review was to critically appraise published articles on vector control strategies and specifically highlight the use of Wolbachia-based control to suppress vector population growth or disrupt viral transmission. We retrieved studies on the control strategies for arboviral transmissions via arthropod vectors and discussed the use of Wolbachia control strategies for eradicating arboviral diseases to identify literature gaps that will be instrumental in developing models to estimate the impact of these control strategies and, in essence, the use of different Wolbachia strains and features.

TI  - A single amino acid substitution in the capsid protein of Zika virus contributes to a neurovirulent phenotype
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 14
AB  - Increasing evidence shows the African lineage Zika virus (ZIKV) displays a more severe neurovirulence compared to the Asian ZIKV. However, viral determinants and the underlying mechanisms of enhanced virulence phenotype remain largely unknown. Herein, we identify a panel of amino acid substitutions that are unique to the African lineage of ZIKVs compared to the Asian lineage by phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment. We then utilize reverse genetic technology to generate recombinant ZIKVs incorporating these lineage-specific substitutions based on an infectious cDNA clone of Asian ZIKV. Through in vitro characterization, we discover a mutant virus with a lysine to arginine substitution at position 101 of capsid (C) protein (termed K101R) displays a larger plaque phenotype, and replicates more efficiently in various cell lines. Moreover, K101R replicates more efficiently in mouse brains and induces stronger inflammatory responses than the wild type (WT) virus in neonatal mice. Finally, a combined analysis reveals the K101R substitution promotes the production of mature C protein without affecting its binding to viral RNA. Our study identifies the role of K101R substitution in the C protein in contributing to the enhanced virulent phenotype of the African lineage ZIKV, which expands our understanding of the complexity of ZIKV proteins.

TI  - A single mutation in the envelope protein modulates flavivirus antigenicity, stability, and pathogenesis
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 13
AB  - The structural flexibility or ‘breathing’ of the envelope (E) protein of flaviviruses allows virions to sample an ensemble of conformations at equilibrium. The molecular basis and functional consequences of virus conformational dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we identified a single mutation at residue 198 (T198F) of the West Nile virus (WNV) E protein domain I-II hinge that regulates virus breathing. The T198F mutation resulted in a ~70-fold increase in sensitivity to neutralization by a monoclonal antibody targeting a cryptic epitope in the fusion loop. Increased exposure of this otherwise poorly accessible fusion loop epitope was accompanied by reduced virus stability in solution at physiological temperatures. Introduction of a mutation at the analogous residue of dengue virus (DENV), but not Zika virus (ZIKV), E protein also increased accessibility of the cryptic fusion loop epitope and decreased virus stability in solution, suggesting that this residue modulates the structural ensembles sampled by distinct flaviviruses at equilibrium in a context dependent manner. Although the T198F mutation did not substantially impair WNV growth kinetics in vitro, studies in mice revealed attenuation of WNV T198F infection. Overall, our study provides insight into the molecular basis and the in vitro and in vivo consequences of flavivirus breathing.

TI  - A single mutation in the PrM gene of Zika virus determines AXL dependency for infection of human neural cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 99
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is spread by mosquito bites and is unique among known flaviviruses for being able to cause microcephaly. Entry factors for ZIKV are incompletely understood, but phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors, including the TAM (Tyro3, AXL, and Mer) and TIM (T-cell Ig mucin) families, can serve as cofactors for flavivirus entry in a cell type-specific manner. We identify AXL as the top hit in a CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screen in human glioblastoma cells and establish a definitive role of AXL, but not TYRO3 or MerTK, for ZIKV infection. Additionally, Spondweni virus also shows AXL dependency, while dengue virus infection is not affected by AXL knockout. Passage of ZIKV in AXL knockout (KO) cells generated a mutant virus capable of infection via AXL-independent mechanisms, and multiple independent selections identified a common mutation, H83R, in the prM coding region of the ZIKV genome. The mutant virus exhibits an increased infectivity rate in AXL KO cells as compared to wild-type ZIKV and is dependent upon the single H83R mutation. The mutant virus’ ability to infect cells in an AXL-independent manner is unrelated to interferon signaling antagonism but likely pertains to a change in virus maturation that leads to a structural disturbance of the ZIKV virion. Our study provides evidence for a potential mechanism linking the viral structural proteins and host PS receptor usage during flavivirus infection. IMPORTANCE A major challenge in elucidating the mechanism of Zika virus (ZIKV) pathogenesis is the multitude of cell types it infects with distinct requirements. The role of phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors in ZIKV infection is cell type-specific, and the controversy surrounds their function in flavivirus entry. Here, we establish a definitive requirement of AXL for infection of human glioblastoma cells by both Zika and Spondweni virus. We then identified a single amino acid mutation (H83R) in the prM protein of ZIKV that allowed AXL-independent infection of these cells. The H83R-mediated escape of AXL requirement is independent of interferon (IFN) signaling suppression by AXL; instead, the mutation has the potential to disrupt the virus assembly and virion structure. This study reveals a previously unknown connection between the PS receptor usage and the flavivirus prM gene, which can guide detailed molecular mechanism studies of the interplay between virion assembly and virus entry.

TI  - A single residue in the αB helix of the E protein is critical for Zika virus thermostability
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 7
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has been linked to a panel of unexpected biological features that diverge significantly from other well-known mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV). A recent study showed that ZIKV displayed much greater stability than DENV at high temperatures, leading to the hypothesis that this superior stability of ZIKV may contribute to its unique pathology and routes of transmission. One interesting feature of viral thermostability is that the variations often have definite genetic and structural basis. A cryo-electron microscopy structural reconstruction of ZIKV virions revealed two distinct structural features of ZIKV: (i) an extended glycan loop structure and (ii) an extra hydrogen-bonding interaction between residues Q350 and T351 of domain III around the 5-fold vertex, which might contribute to the observed high stability of ZIKV . However, follow-up investigations using replicon-based virus-like particle (VLP) and infectious clones have concluded that these domains and interactions are not related to the thermostability of ZIKV . Interestingly, a comparison of the thermostabilities of ZIKV/DENV chimeric viruses with their parental viruses clearly demonstrated that the predominant determinants of ZIKV thermostability lie in the prM-E proteins. This result inspired us to further explore the potential molecular determinants within the prM-E proteins by using the reverse genetics system of ZIKV. Recently, we demonstrated the critical role of residue 264 of the E protein (E-264) in modulating the stability of JEV, and a single H264Q substitution in the E protein significantly decreased the thermal stability of JEV. Residue 264 is located in the αB helix of domain II of the E protein (residues 259–266) of JEV. Sequence alignment revealed that the homologous residue E-264 is threonine 267 (T267) in ZIKV, which is highly conserved among most flaviviruses, including YFV, DENV and SLEV (Fig. 1a), and among all ZIKV strains (Figure S1). To verify the potential role of this residue in ZIKV thermal stability, we introduced the T267Q and T267H mutations (the primer sets used in this study are listed in Table S1) into the αB helix of the E protein based on the infectious clone of ZIKV. Both mutant viruses were successfully constructed and recovered in BHK-21 cells with similar peak titers and plaque morphologies to the WT ZIKV (Fig. 1b). Standard thermal stability assays were performed as previously described, and the results demonstrated that the ZIKV/ T267H mutant virus showed the same resistance to heat as the WT ZIKV at 50 °C. Meanwhile, the ZIKV/T267Q mutant was highly sensitive to heat treatment, and incubation for 30min completely abolished ZIKV infectivity (Fig. 1c). A structural analysis of the E:M:M:E heterotetramer of ZIKV revealed that residue T267 within helix αB of ZIKV is capable of stabilizing viral particles through both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. Residue T267 interacts with V2 and Y27 from the M protein through hydrophobic interactions and forms hydrogen bonds with Q261 and G263 of the E protein, and H267 forms hydrogen bonds with A1 from the M protein and Q261 from the E protein (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Table S2).

JF  - ACS infectious diseases
AB  - Flaviviruses including Zika virus, Dengue virus, Japanese Encephalitis virus and Yellow Fever virus cause heavy burdens to public health around the world. No specific antiviral drug was available in clinic against these flavivirus infections. Heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) has recently been proven to be a promising antiviral target against Zika virus and Dengue virus. Here, we report that, Apoptozole, a small molecule inhibitor of ATPase activity of HSP70 has broad-spectrum anti-flavivirus potential. The mode of action analysis revealed that Apoptozole acted at post-entry step. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes related to cholesterol metabolism, fatty acid synthesis and innate immunity were differentially expressed after treatment of Apoptozole. In vivo data suggested Apoptozole exerted protection effects against ZIKV infection in mouse model by enhancing innate immune response, which suggested a novel anti-ZIKV mechanism of HSP70 inhibitors.

TI  - A small molecule inhibitor of ER-to-cytosol protein dislocation exhibits anti-dengue and anti-Zika virus activity
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 9
AB  - Infection with flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and the recently re-emerging Zika virus (ZIKV), represents an increasing global risk. Targeting essential host elements required for flavivirus replication represents an attractive approach for the discovery of antiviral agents. Previous studies have identified several components of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, a cellular protein quality control process, as host factors crucial for DENV and ZIKV replication. Here, we report that CP26, a small molecule inhibitor of protein dislocation from the ER lumen to the cytosol, which is an essential step for ERAD, has broad-spectrum anti-flavivirus activity. CP26 targets the Hrd1 complex, inhibits ERAD, and induces ER stress. Ricin and cholera toxins are known to hijack the protein dislocation machinery to reach the cytosol, where they exert their cytotoxic effects. CP26 selectively inhibits the activity of cholera toxin but not that of ricin. CP26 exhibits a significant inhibitory activity against both DENV and ZIKV, providing substantial protection to the host cells against virus-induced cell death. This study identified a novel dislocation inhibitor, CP26, that shows potent anti-DENV and anti-ZIKV activity in cells. Furthermore, this study provides the first example of the targeting of host ER dislocation with small molecules to combat flavivirus infection.

TI  - A symbiotic mosquito‐gut bacterium for flavivirus control
JF  - Clinical and Translational Medicine
VL  - 14
AB  - Abstract Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) have emerged as major global public health challenges, causing numerous infections and fatalities each year. However, current measures, including vaccines and treatments, are often limited or ineffective. This highlights the urgent need for novel preventive strategies to control the spread of key mosquito‐borne viruses like DENV and ZIKV. In a recent study published in Science, Zhang et al. isolated a bacterium named Rosenbergiella_YN46 from the gut of field‐caught Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in Yunnan Province, China. This commentary reviews their findings, published on April 19, 2024, which describe the symbiotic bacterium Rosenbergiella_YN46 and its ability to block flavivirus transmission, including both DENV and ZIKV. The bacterium shows promising potential for future dengue fever prevention and provides valuable insights into a novel biological approach for controlling mosquito‐borne viral diseases.

TI  - A Viperin Mutant Bearing the K358R Substitution Lost its Anti-ZIKA Virus Activity
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 20
AB  - Interferon-induced viperin (VP) was identified as playing an important role in the innate immune response against Zika virus (ZIKV). The 361 amino acid long human VP protein comprises of a highly conserved C-terminal region, which has been associated with VP antiviral properties against ZIKV. In the present study, we sought to determine whether the very last C-terminal amino-acid residues of VP might play a role in VP-mediated ZIKV inhibition. To address this issue, a recombinant human viperin (rVPwt) was overexpressed by transfection in human epithelial A549 cells. We confirmed that transient overexpression of rVPwt prior to ZIKV infection dramatically reduced viral replication in A549 cells. Deletion of the last 17 C-terminal amino acids of VP resulted in a higher expression level of mutant protein compared to wild-type VP. Mutational analysis revealed that residue substitution at positions 356 to 360 with five alanine led to the same phenotype. The charged residues Asp356, Lys358, and Asp360 were then identified to play a role in the weak level of VPwt protein in A549 cells. Mutant VP bearing the D360A substitution partially rescued ZIKV growth in A549 cells. Remarkably, a single Lys-to-Arg substitution at position 358 was sufficient to abrogate VP antiviral activity against ZIKV. In conclusion, our study showed that Asp356, Lys358, and Asp360 may have an influence on biochemical properties of VP. Our major finding was that Lys358 was a key amino-acid in VP antiviral properties against ZIKV.

TI  - A zebrafish-based in vivo model of Zika virus infection unveils alterations of the glutamatergic neuronal development and NS4A as a key viral determinant of neuropathogenesis
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 20
AB  - Infection of pregnant women by Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with severe neurodevelopmental defects in newborns through poorly defined mechanisms. Here, we established a zebrafish in vivo model of ZIKV infection to circumvent limitations of existing mammalian models. Leveraging the unique tractability of this system, we gained unprecedented access to the ZIKV-infected brain at early developmental stages. The infection of zebrafish larvae with ZIKV phenocopied the disease in mammals including a reduced head area and neural progenitor cells (NPC) infection and depletion. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses of NPCs isolated from ZIKV-infected embryos revealed a distinct dysregulation of genes involved in survival and neuronal differentiation, including downregulation of the expression of the glutamate transporter vglut1, resulting in an altered glutamatergic network in the brain. Mechanistically, ectopic expression of ZIKV protein NS4A in the larvae recapitulated the morphological defects observed in infected animals, identifying NS4A as a key determinant of neurovirulence and a promising antiviral target for developing therapies.

TI  - Activation of ATF3 via the integrated stress response pathway regulates innate immune response to restrict Zika virus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 98
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that can have devastating health consequences. The developmental and neurological effects of a ZIKV infection arise in part from the virus triggering cellular stress pathways and perturbing transcriptional programs. To date, the underlying mechanisms of transcriptional control directing viral restriction and virus-host interaction are understudied. Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3) is a stress-induced transcriptional effector that modulates the expression of genes involved in a myriad of cellular processes, including inflammation and antiviral responses, to restore cellular homeostasis. While ATF3 is known to be upregulated during ZIKV infection, the mode by which ATF3 is activated, and the specific role of ATF3 during ZIKV infection is unknown. In this study, we show via inhibitor and RNA interference approaches that ZIKV infection initiates the integrated stress response pathway to activate ATF4 which in turn induces ATF3 expression. Additionally, by using CRISPR-Cas9 system to delete ATF3, we found that ATF3 acts to limit ZIKV gene expression in A549 cells. We also determined that ATF3 enhances the expression of antiviral genes such as STAT1 and other components in the innate immunity pathway to induce an ATF3-dependent anti-ZIKV response. Our study reveals crosstalk between the integrated stress response and innate immune response pathways and highlights an important role for ATF3 in establishing an antiviral effect during ZIKV infection. IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that co-opts cellular mechanisms to support viral processes that can reprogram the host transcriptional profile. Such viral-directed transcriptional changes and the pro- or anti-viral outcomes remain understudied. We previously showed that ATF3, a stress-induced transcription factor, is significantly upregulated in ZIKV-infected mammalian cells, along with other cellular and immune response genes. We now define the intracellular pathway responsible for ATF3 activation and elucidate the impact of ATF3 expression on ZIKV infection. We show that during ZIKV infection, the integrated stress response pathway stimulates ATF3 which enhances the innate immune response to antagonize ZIKV infection. This study establishes a link between viral-induced stress response and transcriptional regulation of host defense pathways and thus expands our knowledge of virus-mediated transcriptional mechanisms and transcriptional control of interferon-stimulated genes during ZIKV infection.

TI  - Active Human Complement Reduces the Zika Virus Load via Formation of the Membrane-Attack Complex
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 9
AB  - Although neglected in the past, the interest on Zika virus (ZIKV) raised dramatically in the last several years. The rapid spread of the virus in Latin America and the association of the infection with microcephaly in newborns or Guillain-Barré Syndrome in adults prompted the WHO to declare the ZIKV epidemic to be an international public health emergency in 2016. As the virus gained only limited attention in the past, investigations on interactions of ZIKV with human complement are limited. This prompted us to investigate the stability of the virus to human complement. At low serum concentrations (10%) which refers to complement concentrations found on mucosal surfaces, the virus was relatively stable at 37°C, while at high complement levels (50% serum concentration) ZIKV titers were dramatically reduced, although the virus remained infectious for about 4–5 min under these conditions. The classical pathway was identified as the main actor of complement activation driven by IgM antibodies. In addition, direct binding of C1q to both envelope and NS1 proteins was observed. Formation of the MAC on the viral surface and thus complement-mediated lysis and not opsonization seems to be essential for the reduction of viral titers.

TI  - ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP11 suppresses Zika virus in synergy with PARP12
JF  - Cell & Bioscience
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and ZIKV epidemic have been continuously spreading silently throughout the world and its associated microcephaly and other serious congenital neurological complications poses a significant global threat to public health. Type I interferon response to ZIKV infection in host cells suppresses viral replication by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The study aims to demonstrate the anti-ZIKV mechanism of PARP11. PARP11 knock out and overexpressing A549 cell lines were constructed to evaluate the anti-ZIKV function of PARP11. PARP11−/−, PARP12−/− and PARP11−/−PARP12−/− HEK293T cell lines were constructed to explain the synergistic effect of PARP11 and PARP12 on NS1 and NS3 protein degradation. Western blotting, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assay were performed to illustrate the interaction between PARP11 and PARP12. Both mRNA and protein levels of PARP11 were induced in WT but not IFNAR1−/− cells in response to IFNα or IFNβ stimulation and ZIKV infection. ZIKV replication was suppressed in cells expressed PARP11 but was enhanced in PARP11−/− cells. PARP11 suppressed ZIKV independently on itself PARP enzyme activity. PARP11 interacted with PARP12 and promoted PARP12-mediated ZIKV NS1 and NS3 protein degradation. We identified ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP11 as an anti-ZIKV ISG and found that it cooperated with PARP12 to enhance ZIKV NS1 and NS3 protein degradation. Our findings have broadened the understanding of the anti-viral function of ADP-ribosyltransferase family members, and provided potential therapeutic targets against viral ZIKV infection.

TI  - Advances in Zika Virus–Host Cell Interaction: Current Knowledge and Future Perspectives
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 20
AB  - Emerging mosquito-transmitted RNA viruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV) and Chikungunya represent human pathogens of an immense global health problem. In particular, ZIKV has emerged explosively since 2007 to cause a series of epidemics in the South Pacific and most recently in the Americas. Although typical ZIKV infections are asymptomatic, ZIKV infection during pregnancy is increasingly associated with microcephaly and other fetal developmental abnormalities. In the last few years, genomic and molecular investigations have established a remarkable progress on the pathogenic mechanisms of ZIKV infection using in vitro and in vivo models. Here, we highlight recent advances in ZIKV-host cell interaction studies, including cellular targets of ZIKV, ZIKV-mediated cell death mechanisms, host cell restriction factors that limit ZIKV replication, and immune evasion mechanisms utilized by ZIKV. Understanding of the mechanisms of ZIKV–host interaction at the cellular level will contribute crucial insights into the development of ZIKV therapeutics and vaccines.

TI  - Aedes aegypti adiponectin receptor-like protein signaling facilitates Zika virus infection
JF  - mBio
VL  - 15
AB  - ABSTRACT The Aedes aegypti mosquito plays a critical role in the transmission of viral diseases, including Zika virus, which poses significant public health challenges. Understanding the complex interactions between mosquitoes and viruses is paramount for the development of effective control strategies. In this study, we demonstrate that silencing the A. aegypti adiponectin receptor-like protein (AaARLP) results in a reduction of Zika virus infection. Transcriptomic analysis identified alterations in several trypsin genes and further revealed that AaARLP-knockdown mosquitoes had diminished trypsin activity. Moreover, silencing of selected trypsins resulted in a similar delay in Zika virus infection in mosquitoes, further highlighting the connection between the AaARLP and trypsin. Overall, our findings demonstrate that AaARLP signaling is important for Zika virus infection of A. aegypti. IMPORTANCE Arboviruses pose a significant threat to public health, with mosquitoes, especially Aedes aegypti, being a major vector for their transmission. Gaining insight into the complex interaction between mosquitoes and viruses is essential to build successful control strategies. In this study, we identified a novel pathway connecting the A. aegypti adiponectin receptor-like protein and its association with trypsin, key enzymes involved in blood digestion. Furthermore, we demonstrated the significance of signaling via the adiponectin receptor-like protein in virus infection within the mosquito. Together, our discoveries illuminate mosquito metabolic pathways essential in viral infection.

JF  - Biomedicines
VL  - 12
AB  - GNBPB6, a beta-1,3-glucan-binding protein, was identified in the transcriptome of Aedes aegypti (A. aegypti) with dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya viruses (CHIKV). In this study, we not only clarified that DENV2 and ZIKV regulate the changes in GNBPB6 expression but also identified the relationship of this gene with viral infections. The changes in GNBPB6 expression were quantified and showed a decrease in A. aegypti cells (Aag2 cells) at 2 dpi and 3 dpi and an increase at 4 dpi and 5 dpi (p < 0.05). A significant increase was observed only at 5 dpi after DENV2 infection. Subsequently, a GNBPB6 knockout (KO) cell line was constructed using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and the DENV2 and ZIKV RNA copies, along with cell densities, were quantified and compared between the KO and wild type (WT) cells at different dpi. The result showed that DENV2 and ZIKV RNA copies were significantly increased in the KO cell line with no significant change in cell growth. Finally, DENV2 copies decreased after GNBPB6 was complemented in the KO. In conclusion, GNBPB6 knockout and complementation in Aag2 cells revealed that GNBPB6 can inhibit the replication of both DENV2 and ZIKV. These results contribute to subsequent research on mosquito–virus interactions.

TI  - Aedes aegypti Molecular Responses to Zika Virus: Modulation of Infection by the Toll and Jak/Stat Immune Pathways and Virus Host Factors
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - Zika (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes. However, the molecular interactions between the vector and ZIKV remain largely unexplored. In this work, we further investigated the tropism of ZIKV in two different Aedes aegypti strains and show that the virus infection kinetics, tissue migration, and susceptibility to infection differ between mosquito strains. We also compare the vector transcriptome changes upon ZIKV or DENV infection demonstrating that 40% of the mosquito’s midgut infection-responsive transcriptome is virus-specific at 7 days after virus ingestion. Regulated genes included key factors of the mosquito’s anti-viral immunity. Comparison of the ZIKV and DENV infection-responsive transcriptome data to those available for yellow fever virus and West Nile virus identified 26 genes likely to play key roles in virus infection of Aedes mosquitoes. Through reverse genetic analyses, we show that the Toll and the Jak/Stat innate immune pathways mediate increased resistance to ZIKV infection, and the conserved DENV host factors vATPase and inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase are also utilized for ZIKV infection.

TI  - Aedes aegypti NeSt1 Protein Enhances Zika Virus Pathogenesis by Activating Neutrophils
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - When a Zika virus-infected mosquito bites a person, mosquito saliva is injected into the skin along with the virus. Molecules in this saliva can make virus infection more severe by changing the immune system to make the skin a better place for the virus to replicate. We identified a molecule that activates immune cells, called neutrophils, to recruit other immune cells, called macrophages, that the virus can infect. We named this molecule neutrophil-stimulating factor 1 (NeSt1). When we used antibodies to block NeSt1 in mice and then allowed Zika virus-infected mosquitoes to feed on these mice, they survived much better than mice that do not have antibodies against NeSt1. These findings give us more information about how mosquito saliva enhances virus infection, and it is possible that a vaccine against NeSt1 might protect people against severe Zika virus infection. ABSTRACT Saliva from the mosquito vector of flaviviruses is capable of changing the local immune environment, leading to an increase in flavivirus-susceptible cells at the infected bite site. In addition, an antibody response to specific salivary gland (SG) components changes the pathogenesis of flaviviruses in human populations. To investigate whether antigenic SG proteins are capable of enhancing infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), a reemerging flavivirus primarily transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, we screened for antigenic SG proteins using a yeast display library and demonstrate that a previously undescribed SG protein we term neutrophil stimulating factor 1 (NeSt1) activates primary mouse neutrophils ex vivo. Passive immunization against NeSt1 decreases pro-interleukin-1β and CXCL2 expression, prevents macrophages from infiltrating the bite site, protects susceptible IFNAR−/− IFNGR–/– (AG129) mice from early ZIKV replication, and ameliorates virus-induced pathogenesis. These findings indicate that NeSt1 stimulates neutrophils at the mosquito bite site to change the immune microenvironment, allowing a higher level of early viral replication and enhancing ZIKV pathogenesis.

AB  - Mosquitoes transmit several pathogenic viruses, for example, the chikungunya and Zika viruses. In mosquito cells, virus replication intermediates in the form of double-stranded RNA are cleaved by Dcr2 into 21-nucleotide-long siRNAs, which in turn are used by Ago2 to target the virus genome. A different class of virus-derived small RNAs, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), have also been found in infected insect cells. These piRNAs are longer and are produced in a Dcr2-independent manner. The only known antiviral protein in the PIWI family is Piwi4, which is not involved in piRNA production. It is associated with key proteins of the siRNA and piRNA pathways, although its antiviral function is independent of their actions. ABSTRACT The small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway is a major antiviral response in mosquitoes; however, another RNA interference pathway, the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, has been suggested to be antiviral in mosquitoes. Piwi4 has been reported to be a key mediator of this response in mosquitoes, but it is not involved in the production of virus-specific piRNAs. Here, we show that Piwi4 associates with members of the antiviral exogenous siRNA pathway (Ago2 and Dcr2), as well as with proteins of the piRNA pathway (Ago3, Piwi5, and Piwi6) in an Aedes aegypti-derived cell line, Aag2. Analysis of small RNAs captured by Piwi4 revealed that it is predominantly associated with virus-specific siRNAs in Semliki Forest virus-infected cells and, to a lesser extent, with viral piRNAs. By using a Dcr2 knockout cell line, we showed directly that Ago2 lost its antiviral activity, as it was no longer bound to siRNAs, but Piwi4 retained its antiviral activity in the absence of the siRNA pathway. These results demonstrate a complex interaction between the siRNA and piRNA pathways in A. aegypti and identify Piwi4 as a noncanonical PIWI protein that interacts with members of the siRNA and piRNA pathways, and its antiviral activities may be independent of either pathway.

TI  - Aedes aegypti Shows Increased Susceptibility to Zika Virus via Both In Vitro and In Vivo Models of Type II Diabetes
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Chronic conditions like type II diabetes (T2DM) have long been known to exacerbate many infectious diseases. For many arboviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), severe outcomes, morbidity and mortality usually only occur in patients with such pre-existing conditions. However, the effects of T2DM and other pre-existing conditions on human blood (e.g., hypo/hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia) that may impact infectivity of arboviruses for vectors is largely unexplored. We investigated whether the susceptibility of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes was affected when the mosquitoes fed on “diabetic” bloodmeals, such as bloodmeals composed of artificially glycosylated erythrocytes or those from viremic, diabetic mice (LEPRDB/DB). Increasing glycosylation of erythrocytes from hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) values of 5.5–5.9 to 6.2 increased the infection rate of a Galveston, Texas strain of Ae. aegypti to ZIKV strain PRVABC59 at a bloodmeal titer of 4.14 log10 FFU/mL from 0.0 to 40.9 and 42.9%, respectively. ZIKV was present in the blood of viremic LEPRDB/DB mice at similar levels as isogenic control C57BL/6J mice (3.3 log10 FFU/mL and 3.6 log10 FFU/mL, respectively. When mice sustained a higher ZIKV viremia of 4.6 log10 FFU/mL, LEPRDB/DB mice infected 36.3% of mosquitoes while control C57BL/6J mice with a viremia of 4.2 log10 FFU/mL infected only 4.1%. Additionally, when highly susceptible Ae. aegypti Rockefeller mosquitoes fed on homozygous LEPRDB/DB, heterozygous LEPRWT/DB, and control C57BL/6J mice with viremias of ≈ 4 log10 FFU/mL, 54%, 15%, and 33% were infected, respectively. In total, these data suggest that the prevalence of T2DM in a population may have a significant impact on ZIKV transmission and indicates the need for further investigation of the impacts of pre-existing metabolic conditions on arbovirus transmission.

TI  - Aedes hensilli as a Potential Vector of Chikungunya and Zika Viruses
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 8
AB  - An epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) illness that occurred in July 2007 on Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia prompted entomological studies to identify both the primary vector(s) involved in transmission and the ecological parameters contributing to the outbreak. Larval and pupal surveys were performed to identify the major containers serving as oviposition habitat for the likely vector(s). Adult mosquitoes were also collected by backpack aspiration, light trap, and gravid traps at select sites around the capital city. The predominant species found on the island was Aedes (Stegomyia) hensilli. No virus isolates were obtained from the adult field material collected, nor did any of the immature mosquitoes that were allowed to emerge to adulthood contain viable virus or nucleic acid. Therefore, laboratory studies of the probable vector, Ae. hensilli, were undertaken to determine the likelihood of this species serving as a vector for Zika virus and other arboviruses. Infection rates of up to 86%, 62%, and 20% and dissemination rates of 23%, 80%, and 17% for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue-2 viruses respectively, were found supporting the possibility that this species served as a vector during the Zika outbreak and that it could play a role in transmitting other medically important arboviruses.

TI  - Aedes Mosquito Salivary Components and Their Effect on the Immune Response to Arboviruses
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Vector-borne diseases are responsible for over a billion infections each year and nearly one million deaths. Mosquito-borne dengue virus, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, Chikungunya, and Rift Valley Fever viruses constitute major public health problems in regions with high densities of arthropod vectors. During the initial step of the transmission cycle, vector, host, and virus converge at the bite site, where local immune cells interact with the vector's saliva. Hematophagous mosquito saliva is a mixture of bioactive components known to modulate vertebrate hemostasis, immunity, and inflammation during the insect's feeding process. The capacity of mosquito saliva to modulate the host immune response has been well-studied over the last few decades and has led to the consensus that the presence of saliva is linked to the enhancement of virus transmission, host susceptibility, disease progression, viremia levels, and mortality. We review some of the major aspects of the interactions between mosquito saliva and the host immune response that may be useful for future studies on the control of arboviruses.

AB  - Aedes-borne viruses are responsible for high-impact neglected tropical diseases and unpredictable outbreaks such as the ongoing Zika epidemics. Aedes mosquitoes spread different arboviruses such as Dengue virus (DENV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus, among others, and are responsible for the continuous emergence and reemergence of these pathogens. These viruses have complex transmission cycles that include two hosts, namely the Aedes mosquito as a vector and susceptible vertebrate hosts. Human infection with arboviruses causes diseases that range from subclinical or mild to febrile diseases, encephalitis, and hemorrhagic fever. Infected mosquitoes do not show detectable signs of disease, even though the virus maintains a lifelong persistent infection. The infection of the Aedes mosquito by viruses involves a molecular crosstalk between cell and viral proteins. An understanding of how mosquito vectors and viruses interact is of fundamental interest, and it also offers novel perspectives for disease control. In recent years, mass spectrometry (MS)-based strategies in combination with bioinformatics have been successfully applied to identify and quantify global changes in cellular proteins, lipids, peptides, and metabolites in response to viral infection. Although the information about proteomics in the Aedes mosquito is limited, the information that has been reported can set up the basis for future studies. This review reflects how MS-based approaches have extended our understanding of Aedes mosquito biology and the development of DENV and CHIKV infection in the vector. Finally, this review discusses future challenges in the field.

TI  - Akt Kinase Intervenes in Flavivirus Replication by Interacting with Viral Protein NS5
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Arthropod-borne flaviviruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), Usutu virus (USUV), and West Nile virus (WNV), are a growing cause of human illness and death around the world. Presently, no licensed antivirals to control them are available and, therefore, search for broad-spectrum antivirals, including host-directed compounds, is essential. The PI3K/Akt pathway controls essential cellular functions involved in cell metabolism and proliferation. Moreover, Akt has been found to participate in modulating replication in different viruses including the flaviviruses. In this work we studied the interaction of flavivirus NS5 polymerases with the cellular kinase Akt. In vitro NS5 phosphorylation experiments with Akt showed that flavivirus NS5 polymerases are phosphorylated and co-immunoprecipitate by Akt. Polymerase activity assays of Ala- and Glu-generated mutants for the Akt-phosphorylated residues also indicate that Glu mutants of ZIKV and USUV NS5s present a reduced primer-extension activity that was not observed in WNV mutants. Furthermore, treatment with Akt inhibitors (MK-2206, honokiol and ipatasertib) reduced USUV and ZIKV titers in cell culture but, except for honokiol, not WNV. All these findings suggest an important role for Akt in flavivirus replication although with specific differences among viruses and encourage further investigations to examine the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway as an antiviral potential target.

TI  - All genera of Flaviviridae host a conserved Xrn1-resistant RNA motif
JF  - RNA Biology
VL  - 18
SP  - 2321
EP  - 2329
AB  - ABSTRACT After infection by flaviviruses like Zika and West Nile virus, eukaryotic hosts employ the well-conserved endoribonuclease Xrn1 to degrade the viral genomic RNA. Within the 3ʹ untranslated regions, this enzyme encounters intricate Xrn1-resistant structures. This results in the accumulation of subgenomic flaviviral RNAs, an event that improves viral growth and aggravates viral pathogenicity. Xrn1-resistant RNAs have been established throughout the flaviviral genus, but not yet throughout the entire Flaviviridae family. In this work, we use previously determined characteristics of these structures to identify homologous sequences in many members of the genera pegivirus, hepacivirus and pestivirus. We used structural alignment and mutational analyses to establish that these sequences indeed represent Xrn1-resistant RNA and that they employ the general features of the flaviviral xrRNAs, consisting of a double pseudoknot formed by five base-paired regions stitched together by a crucial triple base interaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pestivirus Bungowannah virus produces subgenomic RNA in vivo. Altogether, these results indicate that viruses make use of a universal Xrn1-resistant RNA throughout the Flaviviridae family.

TI  - Allosteric Inhibition of Neutral Sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) by DPTIP: From Antiflaviviral Activity to Deciphering Its Binding Site through In Silico Studies and Experimental Validation
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 23
AB  - Flavivirus comprises globally emerging and re-emerging pathogens such as Zika virus (ZIKV), Dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV), among others. Although some vaccines are available, there is an unmet medical need as no effective antiviral treatment has been approved for flaviviral infections. The development of host-directed antivirals (HDAs) targeting host factors that are essential for viral replication cycle offers the opportunity for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals. In the case of flaviviruses, recent studies have revealed that neutral sphingomyelinase 2, (nSMase2), involved in lipid metabolism, plays a key role in WNV and ZIKV infection. As a proof of concept, we have determined the antiviral activity of the non-competitive nSMase2 inhibitor DPTIP against WNV and ZIKV virus. DPTIP showed potent antiviral activity with EC50 values of 0.26 µM and 1.56 µM for WNV and ZIKV, respectively. In order to unravel the allosteric binding site of DPTIP in nSMase2 and the details of the interaction, computational studies have been carried out. These studies have revealed that DPTIP could block the DK switch in nSMase2. Moreover, the analysis of the residues contributing to the binding identified His463 as a crucial residue. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity of DPTIP on the H463A mutant protein supported our hypothesis. Thus, an allosteric cavity in nSMase2 has been identified that can be exploited for the development of new inhibitors with anti-flaviviral activity.

TI  - Altered m6A modification of specific cellular transcripts affects Flaviviridae infection
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) can modulate mRNA fate and thus affect many biological processes. We analyzed m6A modification across the transcriptome following infection by dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). We found that infection by these viruses in the Flaviviridae family alters m6A modification of specific cellular transcripts, including RIOK3 and CIRBP. During viral infection, the addition of m6A to RIOK3 promotes its translation, while loss of m6A in CIRBP promotes alternative splicing. Importantly, we found that activation of innate immune sensing or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response by viral infection contributes to the changes in m6A modification in RIOK3 and CIRBP, respectively. Further, several transcripts with infection-altered m6A profiles, including RIOK3 and CIRBP, encode proteins that influence DENV, ZIKV, and HCV infection. Overall, this work reveals that cellular signaling pathways activated during viral infection lead to alterations in m6A modification of host mRNAs to regulate infection.

TI  - AMFR-mediated Flavivirus NS2A ubiquitination subverts ER-phagy to augment viral pathogenicity
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 15
AB  - Flaviviruses strategically utilize the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in their replication cycles. However, the role of ER autophagy (ER-phagy) in viral replication process remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that prolonged Zika virus (ZIKV) infection results from the degradation of ER-phagy receptor FAM134B, facilitated by viral NS2A protein. Mechanistically, ER-localized NS2A undergoes K48-linked polyubiquitination at lysine (K) 56 by E3 ligase AMFR. Ubiquitinated NS2A binds to FAM134B and AMFR orchestrates the degradation of NS2A-FAM134B complexes. AMFR-catalyzed NS2A ubiquitination not only targets FAM134B degradation but also hinders the FAM134B-AMFR axis. Notably, a recombinant ZIKV mutant (ZIKV-NS2AK56R), lacking ubiquitination and ER-phagy inhibition, exhibits attenuation in ZIKV-induced microcephalic phenotypes in human brain organoids and replicates less efficiently, resulting in weakened pathogenesis in mouse models. In this work, our mechanistic insights propose that flaviviruses manipulate ER-phagy to modulate ER turnover, driving viral infection. Furthermore, AMFR-mediated flavivirus NS2A ubiquitination emerges as a potential determinant of viral pathogenecity.

TI  - AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) promotes innate immunity and antiviral defense against Zika virus induced ocular infection
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
AB  - 
 
 
 We recently reported that Zika Virus infected multiple retinal cell types and caused chorioretinal atrophy in mouse eyes. In this study, we investigated the potential role of AMPK, a master regulator of cellular metabolism, in pathogenesis of ocular ZIKV infection.
 
 
 
 Primary human RPE cells were infected with ZIKV for various time points and AMPK phosphorylation was detected Western blotting (WB). AMPK activity was modulated by pharmacological activators (AICAR and Metformin) and inhibitors (Compound C) of AMPK. ZIKV replication was assessed by immunofluorscence staining for 4G2 and western blot detection of NS3 proteins. For in vivo studies B6 mice eye were challenged with ZIKV with or without AICAR treatment and disease progression were measured by fundus imaging. Activation of innate immune and antiviral response genes was assessed by qPCR.
 
 
 
 ZIKV challenge upregulated the AMPK phosphorylation in Pr. RPE cells in a time-dependent fashion. Our results indicate that AMPK deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were more permissive to ZIKV replication as compared to WT MEFs. AMPK activation using AICAR and Metformin restricted ZIKV replication in Pr. RPE cells and presence of Compound C reversed the effect of AICAR/Metformin. In vivo AICAR treatment ameliorated ZIKV-induced chorioretinal atrophy in mice with increased antiviral responses. ZIKV infection leads to activation of MEK pathways and an MEK pathways inhibitor, U0126, attenuated ZIKV replication.
 
 
 
 Collectively, these findings indicate the AMPK activation evokes antiviral innate responses and restricts ZIKV replication. Hence, targeting AMPK signaling can be explored to develop anti-viral therapy against ZIKV infection.

TI  - AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Restricts Zika Virus Replication in Endothelial Cells by Potentiating Innate Antiviral Responses and Inhibiting Glycolysis
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 204
SP  - 1810
EP  - 1824
AB  - Key Points ZIKV inhibits AMPK signaling and increases glycolysis to promote viral replication. AMPK potentiates antiviral immune response and inhibits ZIKV-induced glycolysis. AMPK ablation increases ZIKV replication and reduces innate antiviral responses. Visual Abstract Viruses are known to perturb host cellular metabolism to enable their replication and spread. However, little is known about the interactions between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and host metabolism. Using primary human retinal vascular endothelial cells and an established human endothelial cell line, we investigated the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of energy metabolism, in response to ZIKV challenge. ZIKV infection caused a time-dependent reduction in the active phosphorylated state of AMPK and of its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Pharmacological activation of AMPK using 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), metformin, and a specific AMPKα activator (GSK621) attenuated ZIKV replication. This activity was reversed by an AMPK inhibitor (compound C). Lentivirus-mediated knockdown of AMPK and the use of AMPKα−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts provided further evidence that AMPK has an antiviral effect on ZIKV replication. Consistent with its antiviral effect, AMPK activation potentiated the expression of genes with antiviral properties (e.g., IFNs, OAS2, ISG15, and MX1) and inhibited inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF-α and CCL5). Bioenergetic analysis showed that ZIKV infection evokes a glycolytic response, as evidenced by elevated extracellular acidification rate and increased expression of key glycolytic genes (GLUT1, HK2, TPI, and MCT4); activation of AMPK by AICAR treatment reduced this response. Consistent with this, 2-deoxyglucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis, augmented AMPK activity and attenuated ZIKV replication. Thus, our study demonstrates that the anti-ZIKV effect of AMPK signaling in endothelial cells is mediated by reduction of viral-induced glycolysis and enhanced innate antiviral responses.

Intrinsic immunity is known to be a frontline defense against viruses through host anti-viral restriction factors. Limited knowledge is available on intrinsic immunity against ZIKV in brains. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is predominantly expressed in brains and implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's diseases. We have found that ZIKV interacts with APP, and viral infection increases APP expression via enhancing protein stability. Moreover, we identified the viral peptide, HGSQHSGMIVNDTGHETDENRAKVEITPNSPRAEATLGGFGSLGL, which is capable of en-hancing APP expression. We observed that aging brain tissues with APP had protective effects on ZIKV infection by reducing the availability of the viruses. Also, knockdown of APP expression or blocking ZIKV-APP interactions enhanced ZIKV replication in human neural progenitor/stem cells. Finally, intracranial infection of ZIKV in APP-null neonatal mice resulted in higher mortality and viral yields. Taken together, these findings suggest that APP is a restriction factor that protects against ZIKV by serving as a decoy receptor, and plays a protective role in ZIKV-mediated brain injuries.

TI  - An Alanine-to-Valine Substitution in the Residue 175 of Zika Virus NS2A Protein Affects Viral RNA Synthesis and Attenuates the Virus In Vivo
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 10
AB  - The recent outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV), its association with Guillain–Barré syndrome and fetal abnormalities, and the lack of approved vaccines and antivirals, highlight the importance of developing countermeasures to combat ZIKV disease. In this respect, infectious clones constitute excellent tools to accomplish these goals. However, flavivirus infectious clones are often difficult to work with due to the toxicity of some flavivirus sequences in bacteria. To bypass this problem, several alternative approaches have been applied for the generation of ZIKV clones including, among others, in vitro ligation, insertions of introns and using infectious subgenomic amplicons. Here, we report a simple and novel DNA-launched approach based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to generate a cDNA clone of Rio Grande do Norte Natal ZIKV strain. The sequence was identified from the brain tissue of an aborted fetus with microcephaly. The BAC clone was fully stable in bacteria and the infectious virus was efficiently recovered in Vero cells through direct delivery of the cDNA clone. The rescued virus yielded high titers in Vero cells and was pathogenic in a validated mouse model (A129 mice) of ZIKV infection. Furthermore, using this infectious clone we have generated a mutant ZIKV containing a single amino acid substitution (A175V) in the NS2A protein that presented reduced viral RNA synthesis in cell cultures, was highly attenuated in vivo and induced fully protection against a lethal challenge with ZIKV wild-type. This BAC approach provides a stable and reliable reverse genetic system for ZIKV that will help to identify viral determinants of virulence and facilitate the development of vaccine and therapeutic strategies.

TI  - An epigenetic ‘extreme makeover’: the methylation of flaviviral RNA (and beyond)
JF  - RNA Biology
VL  - 18
SP  - 696
EP  - 708
AB  - ABSTRACT Beyond their high clinical relevance worldwide, flaviviruses (comprising dengue and Zika viruses) are of particular interest to understand the spatiotemporal control of RNA metabolism. Indeed, their positive single-stranded viral RNA genome (vRNA) undergoes in the cytoplasm replication, translation and encapsidation, three steps of the flavivirus life cycle that are coordinated through a fine-tuned equilibrium. Over the last years, RNA methylation has emerged as a powerful mechanism to regulate messenger RNA metabolism at the posttranscriptional level. Not surprisingly, flaviviruses exploit RNA epigenetic strategies to control crucial steps of their replication cycle as well as to evade sensing by the innate immune system. This review summarizes the current knowledge about vRNA methylation events and their impacts on flavivirus replication and pathogenesis. We also address the important challenges that the field of epitranscriptomics faces in reliably and accurately identifying RNA methylation sites, which should be considered in future studies on viral RNA modifications.

TI  - An evolutionary NS1 mutation enhances Zika virus evasion of host interferon induction
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 9
AB  - Virus–host interactions determine an infection outcome. The Asian lineage of Zika virus (ZIKV), responsible for the recent epidemics, has fixed a mutation in the NS1 gene after 2012 that enhances mosquito infection. Here we report that the same mutation confers NS1 to inhibit interferon-β induction. This mutation enables NS1 binding to TBK1 and reduces TBK1 phosphorylation. Engineering the mutation into a pre-epidemic ZIKV strain debilitates the virus for interferon-β induction; reversing the mutation in an epidemic ZIKV strain invigorates the virus for interferon-β induction; these mutational effects are lost in IRF3-knockout cells. Additionally, ZIKV NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 can also suppress interferon-β production through targeting distinct components of the RIG-I pathway; however, for these proteins, no antagonistic difference is observed among various ZIKV strains. Our results support the mechanism that ZIKV has accumulated mutation(s) that increases the ability to evade immune response and potentiates infection and epidemics. The Asian lineage of Zika virus (ZIKV) has acquired a mutation in NS1 that enhances mosquito infection. Here, Xia et al. show that the same mutation interferes with interferon production through interaction with TBK1 and affects ZIKV replication in mice.

TI  - An Integrated Systems Biology Approach Identifies the Proteasome as A Critical Host Machinery for ZIKV and DENV Replication
JF  - Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics
VL  - 19
SP  - 108
EP  - 122
AB  - The Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) flaviviruses exhibit similar replicative processes but distinct clinical outcomes. A systematic understanding of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks can reveal cellular pathways critical to viral replication and disease pathogenesis. Here we employed three independent systems biology approaches toward this goal. First, protein array analysis of direct interactions between individual ZIKV/DENV viral proteins and 20,240 human proteins revealed multiple conserved cellular pathways and protein complexes, including proteasome complexes. Second, an RNAi screen of 10,415 druggable genes to identify host proteins required for ZIKV infection uncovered proteasome proteins. Third, a high-throughput screening of 6,016 bioactive compounds for ZIKV inhibitors yielded 134 effective compounds, including six proteasome inhibitors that suppress both ZIKV and DENV replication. Integrative analyses of these orthogonal datasets pinpoints proteasome as critical host machinery for ZIKV/DENV replication. Our study provides multi-omics datasets for further studies of flavivirus-host interactions, disease pathogenesis, and new drug targets.

TI  - An isoform of Dicer protects mammalian stem cells against multiple RNA viruses
JF  - Science
VL  - 373
SP  - 231
EP  - 236
AB  - An antiviral Dicer defends stem cells Stem cells have a pivotal role in maintaining tissue architecture, integrity, and renewal. Poirier et al. demonstrate that mammalian stem cells can protect themselves from some RNA viruses by expressing an alternatively spliced isoform of the enzyme Dicer called aviD, which potentiates antiviral RNA interference (see the Perspective by Shahrudin and Ding). aviD acts by cleaving long, base-paired viral RNAs to generate small interfering RNAs that direct the sequence-specific cleavage of homologous viral RNAs. This process is reminiscent of that in insects and worms, which also use Dicer-dependent RNA interference in antiviral defense, and contrasts with mammalian differentiated cells, which generally rely on the interferon system to combat virus infection. Science, abg2264, this issue p. 231; see also abj5673, p. 160 Mammalian stem cells thwart RNA virus infection by expressing an isoform of Dicer that potentiates antiviral RNA interference. In mammals, early resistance to viruses relies on interferons, which protect differentiated cells but not stem cells from viral replication. Many other organisms rely instead on RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by a specialized Dicer protein that cleaves viral double-stranded RNA. Whether RNAi also contributes to mammalian antiviral immunity remains controversial. We identified an isoform of Dicer, named antiviral Dicer (aviD), that protects tissue stem cells from RNA viruses—including Zika virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—by dicing viral double-stranded RNA to orchestrate antiviral RNAi. Our work sheds light on the molecular regulation of antiviral RNAi in mammalian innate immunity, in which different cell-intrinsic antiviral pathways can be tailored to the differentiation status of cells.

TI  - An Overview of Zika Virus and Zika Virus Induced Neuropathies
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 26
AB  - Flaviviruses pose a major public health concern across the globe. Among them, Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging and reemerging arthropod-borne flavivirus that has become a major international public health problem following multiple large outbreaks over the past two decades. The majority of infections caused by ZIKV exhibit mild symptoms. However, the virus has been found to be associated with a variety of congenital neural abnormalities, including microcephaly in children and Guillain–Barre syndrome in adults. The exact prediction of the potential of ZIKV transmission is still enigmatic and underlines the significance of routine detection of the virus in suspected areas. ZIKV transmission from mother to fetus (including fetal abnormalities), viral presence in immune-privileged areas, and sexual transmission demonstrate the challenges in understanding the factors governing viral persistence and pathogenesis. This review illustrates the transmission patterns, epidemiology, control strategies (through vaccines, antivirals, and vectors), oncolytic aspects, molecular insights into neuro-immunopathogenesis, and other neuropathies caused by ZIKV. Additionally, we summarize in vivo and in vitro models that could provide an important platform to study ZIKV pathogenesis and the underlying governing cellular and molecular mechanisms.

JF  - Nature microbiology
VL  - 4

EP  - 2382
AB  - Flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), cause severe human disease. Co-opting cellular factors for viral translation and viral genome replication at the endoplasmic reticulum is a shared replication strategy, despite different clinical outcomes. Although the protein products of these viruses have been studied in depth, how the RNA genomes operate inside human cells is poorly understood. Using comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS), we took an RNA-centric viewpoint of flaviviral infection and identified several hundred proteins associated with both DENV and ZIKV genomic RNA in human cells. Genome-scale knockout screens assigned putative functional relevance to the RNA–protein interactions observed by ChIRP-MS. The endoplasmic-reticulum-localized RNA-binding proteins vigilin and ribosome-binding protein 1 directly bound viral RNA and each acted at distinct stages in the life cycle of flaviviruses. Thus, this versatile strategy can elucidate features of human biology that control the pathogenesis of clinically relevant viruses. A survey of the cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that interact with dengue virus and Zika virus genomic RNA identifies ribosome-binding protein 1 and vigilin as bona fide RBPs able to promote viral RNA translation, replication and stability.

TI  - An Unprecedented Octahedral Trifluoromagnesate MgF3(Wat)– Transition State Analog Reveals The Molecular Mechanism of ATP Hydrolysis by Zika Virus Helicase
AB  - Metal fluoride complexes mimic the transferring phosphoryl group in many enzyme-catalyzed reactions. We here employ the trifluoromagnesate transition state analog (TSA) to study a Zika virus NS3h helicase, which uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to reorganize ssRNA leading to completion of virus replication. The crystal structure of this TSA complex displays two conformations for a catalytically important loop, demonstrating how ATP hydrolysis can be coupled with RNA translocation. Unexpectedly, the trifluoromagnesate core of this transition state complex is octahedral. It is identified as having an unprecedented MgF3(Wat)– ligand, confirmed by 19F NMR analysis. This structure was further probed by quantum mechanical calculations of the catalytic core (200 atoms), confirming the structural data interpretation and the concerted mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by this class of helicase. The formation of this MgF3(Wat)– ligand in helicase but not in other multiple MFx structures for ATPases and GTPases strongly implies they cannot possess such an additional water in their active sites.

TI  - Analysis of the Aedes albopictus C6/36 genome provides insight into cell line utility for viral propagation
JF  - GigaScience
VL  - 7
AB  - Background The 50-year old Aedes albopictus C6/36 cell line is a resource for the detection, amplification, and analysis of mosquito-borne viruses including Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. The cell line is derived from an unknown number of larvae from an unspecified strain of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Toward improved utility of the cell line for research in virus transmission, we present an annotated assembly of the C6/36 genome. Results The C6/36 genome assembly has the largest contig N50 (3.3 Mbp) of any mosquito assembly, presents the sequences of both haplotypes for most of the diploid genome, reveals independent null mutations in both alleles of the Dicer locus, and indicates a male-specific genome. Gene annotation was computed with publicly available mosquito transcript sequences. Gene expression data from cell line RNA sequence identified enrichment of growth-related pathways and conspicuous deficiency in aquaporins and inward rectifier K+ channels. As a test of utility, RNA sequence data from Zika-infected cells was mapped to the C6/36 genome and transcriptome assemblies. Host subtraction reduced the data set by 89%, enabling faster characterization of non-host reads. Conclusions The C6/36 genome sequence and annotation should enable additional uses of the cell line to study arbovirus vector interactions and interventions aimed at restricting the spread of human disease.

TI  - Analysis of Zika virus capsid-Aedes aegypti mosquito interactome reveals pro-viral host factors critical for establishing infection
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 12
AB  - The escalating global prevalence of arboviral diseases emphasizes the need to improve our understanding of their biology. Research in this area has been hindered by the lack of molecular tools for studying virus-mosquito interactions. Here, we develop an Aedes aegypti cell line which stably expresses Zika virus (ZIKV) capsid proteins in order to study virus-vector protein-protein interactions through quantitative label-free proteomics. We identify 157 interactors and show that eight have potentially pro-viral activity during ZIKV infection in mosquito cells. Notably, silencing of transitional endoplasmic reticulum protein TER94 prevents ZIKV capsid degradation and significantly reduces viral replication. Similar results are observed if the TER94 ortholog (VCP) functioning is blocked with inhibitors in human cells. In addition, we show that an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, UBR5, mediates the interaction between TER94 and ZIKV capsid. Our study demonstrates a pro-viral function for TER94/VCP during ZIKV infection that is conserved between human and mosquito cells. Here the authors develop mosquito cell lines expressing Zika virus (ZIKV) capsid and perform proteomics experiments retrieving 157 protein interactors, of which they show 8 to act as pro-viral factors, showing the transitional endoplasmic reticulum 94 (TER94) and its human ortholog VCP target ZIKV capsid to proteasomal degradation to facilitate infection.

TI  - Ankle2, A Target of Zika Virus, Controls Asymmetric Cell Division of Neuroblasts and Uncovers a Novel Microcephaly Pathway
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Neuroblasts in flies divide asymmetrically by establishing polarity, distributing cell fate determinants asymmetrically, and positioning their spindle for cell division. The apical complex contains aPKC, Bazooka (Par3), and Par6, and its activity depends on L(2)gl. We show that Ankle2 interacts with L(2)gl and affects aPKC. Reducing Ankle2 levels disrupts ER and nuclear envelope morphology, releasing the kinase Ballchen/VRK1 into the cytosol. These defects are associated with reduced phosphorylation of aPKC, disruption of Par complex localization, and spindle alignment defects. Importantly, removal of one copy of ballchen/VRK1 or l(2)gl suppresses the loss of Ankle2 and restores viability and brain size. The Zika virus NS4A protein interacts with Drosophila Ankle2 and VRK1 in dividing neuroblasts. Human mutational studies implicate this neural cell division pathway in microcephaly and motor neuron disease. In summary, NS4A, ANKLE2, VRK1 and LLGL1 define a novel pathway that impinges on asymmetric determinants of neural stem cell division.

TI  - ANKS4B Restricts Replication of Zika Virus by Downregulating the Autophagy
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Infection of Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a severe threaten to global health while no specific drug is available. In this study, we explored the relationship between ZIKV and a cellular protein, ankyrin repeat and sterile motif domain containing 4b (ANKS4B). Our data revealed that the expression of ANKS4B in cultured cells and in neonatal mice was downregulated by ZIKV infection. The reduction of ANKS4B upon ZIKV infection was caused by decrease of two hepatocyte nuclear factors HNF1α and HNF4α. Through CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system, we generated two ANKS4B knockout (KO) cell clones in A549 and Huh7 cells respectively. In the ANKS4B-KO cells, the viral replication levels including viral RNA, protein, and titer were significantly enhanced, which was reversed by trans-complementation of ANKS4B. ANKS4B did not affect the viral entry step, but impaired the autophagy induced by ZIKV infection. Furthermore, our data showed that inhibition of autophagy led to similar replication levels of ZIKV in ANKS4B-sufficient and ANKS4B-deficient cells, suggesting the antiviral effect of ANKS4B relied on its modulation on the autophagy. Therefore, our work identified ANKS4B as a new restriction factor of ZIKV.

TI  - Antagonism of interferon signaling by fibroblast growth factors promotes viral replication
JF  - EMBO Molecular Medicine
VL  - 12
AB  - Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play key roles in the pathogenesis of different human diseases, but the cross‐talk between FGFs and other cytokines remains largely unexplored. We identified an unexpected antagonistic effect of FGFs on the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of FGF receptor signaling in keratinocytes promoted the expression of interferon‐stimulated genes (ISG) and proteins in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, FGF7 or FGF10 treatment of keratinocytes suppressed ISG expression under homeostatic conditions and in response to IFN or poly(I:C) treatment. FGF‐mediated ISG suppression was independent of IFN receptors, occurred at the transcriptional level, and required FGF receptor kinase and proteasomal activity. It is not restricted to keratinocytes and functionally relevant, since FGFs promoted the replication of herpes simplex virus I (HSV‐1), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and Zika virus. Most importantly, inhibition of FGFR signaling blocked HSV‐1 replication in cultured human keratinocytes and in mice. These results suggest the use of FGFR kinase inhibitors for the treatment of viral infections.

TI  - Antibiotic fidaxomicin is an RdRp inhibitor as a potential new therapeutic agent against Zika virus
JF  - BMC Medicine
VL  - 18
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a global health problem, and its complications, including congenital Zika syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome, constitute a continued threat to humans. Unfortunately, effective therapeutics against ZIKV infection are not available thus far. We screened the compounds collection consisting of 1789 FDA-approved drugs by a computational docking method to obtain anti-ZIKV candidate compounds targeting ZIKV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). SPR (BIAcore) assay was employed to demonstrate the candidate compounds’ direct binding to ZIKV RdRp, and polymerase activity assay was used to determine the inhibitory effect on ZIKV RdRp-catalyzed RNA synthesis. The antiviral effects on ZIKV in vitro and in vivo were detected in infected cultured cells and in Ifnar1−/− mice infected by ZIKV virus using plaque assay, western blotting, tissue immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. Here, we report that a first-in-class macrocyclic antibiotic, which has been clinically used to treat Clostridium difficile infection, fidaxomicin, potently inhibits ZIKV replication in vitro and in vivo. Our data showed that fidaxomicin was effective against African and Asian lineage ZIKV in a wide variety of cell lines of various tissue origins, and prominently suppressed ZIKV infection and significantly improved survival of infected mice. In addition, fidaxomicin treatment reduced the virus load in the brains and testes, and alleviated ZIKV-associated pathological damages, such as paralysis, hunching, and neuronal necrosis in the cerebra. Furthermore, our mechanistic study showed that fidaxomicin directly bound ZIKV NS5 protein and inhibited the RNA synthesis-catalyzing activity of ZIKV RdRp. Our data suggest that fidaxomicin may represent an effective anti-ZIKV agent. In the light that fidaxomicin is already a clinically used drug, there might be a promising prospect in the development of fidaxomicin to be an antiviral therapeutic.

TI  - Antimalarial drugs and their metabolites are potent Zika virus inhibitors
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 91
SP  - 1182
EP  - 1190
AB  - Studies aimed at repurposing existing drugs revealed that some antimalarial compounds possess anti‐Zika virus (anti‐ZIKV) activity. Here, we further tested 14 additional antimalarial drugs and their metabolites or analogs for anti‐ZIKV activity using a phenotypic screening approach. We identified four compounds with varying anti‐ZIKV activity, including a metabolite of amodiaquine termed desethylamodiaquine (DAQ) and N‐desethylchloroquine (DECQ), a metabolite of chloroquine, which both exhibited low micromolar effective concentrations against three different ZIKV strains. Two other compounds termed dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and quinidine (QD) exhibited only partial inhibition of ZIKV replication. Characterization of the inhibitory mechanisms of DAQ and DECQ showed that both drugs target the entry step as well as postentry events of the viral replication cycle. These hits represent attractive starting points for future optimization of new anti‐ZIKV drug candidates derived from antimalarial drugs and their analogs.

TI  - Antiviral Activity of Quercetin Hydrate against Zika Virus
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 24
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has re-emerged in recent decades, leading to outbreaks of Zika fever in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America. Despite its drastic re-emergence and clinical impact, no vaccines or antiviral compounds are available to prevent or control ZIKV infection. This study evaluated the potential antiviral activity of quercetin hydrate against ZIKV infection and demonstrated that this substance inhibits virus particle production in A549 and Vero cells under different treatment conditions. In vitro antiviral activity was long-lasting (still observed 72 h post-infection), suggesting that quercetin hydrate affects multiple rounds of ZIKV replication. Molecular docking indicates that quercetin hydrate can efficiently interact with the specific allosteric binding site cavity of the NS2B-NS3 proteases and NS1-dimer. These results identify quercetin as a potential compound to combat ZIKV infection in vitro.

TI  - Antiviral and Immunomodulatory Effects of Zafirlukast Against Flaviviruses via Inhibition of the TNF Signaling Pathway
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 97
AB  - The two most clinically important members of the flavivirus genus, Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) pose a significant public health challenge. They cause a range of diseases in humans, from hemorrhagic to neurological manifestations, leading to economic and social burden worldwide. Nevertheless, there are no approved antiviral drugs to treat these infections. Zafirlukast is an orally available Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for the prophylaxis and treatment of chronic asthma. It is a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) with high selectivity of the cysteinyl leukotriene‐1 receptor (CYSLTR1) that acts as an immune modulator. Thus, we evaluated the antiviral potential of Zafirlukast against ZIKV and DENV in SK‐N‐SH cells. We showed that Zafirlukast exhibited potent antiviral activity against ZIKV, which could be linked to Zafirlukast's immune blockade of TNF signaling pathways and its downstream signaling pathways such as MAPK and ERK1/2. In addition, our results showed that Zafirlukast also counteracts ZIKV‐induced changes in key genes involved in cellular lipid metabolism. Thus, these findings highlight the translational potential of optimizing Zafirlukast as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of ZIKV and DENV.

TI  - Antiviral Compounds for Blocking Arboviral Transmission in Mosquitoes
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Mosquito-borne arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as the dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are important human pathogens that are responsible for significant global morbidity and mortality. The recent emergence and re-emergence of mosquito-borne viral diseases (MBVDs) highlight the urgent need for safe and effective vaccines, therapeutics, and vector-control approaches to prevent MBVD outbreaks. In nature, arboviruses circulate between vertebrate hosts and arthropod vectors; therefore, disrupting the virus lifecycle in mosquitoes is a major approach for combating MBVDs. Several strategies were proposed to render mosquitoes that are refractory to arboviral infection, for example, those involving the generation of genetically modified mosquitoes or infection with the symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia. Due to the recent development of high-throughput screening methods, an increasing number of drugs with inhibitory effects on mosquito-borne arboviruses in mammalian cells were identified. These antivirals are useful resources that can impede the circulation of arboviruses between arthropods and humans by either rendering viruses more vulnerable in humans or suppressing viral infection by reducing the expression of host factors in mosquitoes. In this review, we summarize recent advances in small-molecule antiarboviral drugs in mammalian and mosquito cells, and discuss how to use these antivirals to block the transmission of MBVDs.

TI  - Antiviral RNAi Mechanisms to Arboviruses in Mosquitoes: microRNA Profile of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus from Grenada, West Indies
JF  - Applied Microbiology
AB  - Mosquito-borne arboviruses, such as dengue virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus and yellow fever virus, impose a tremendous cost on the health of populations around the world. As a result, much effort has gone into the study of the impact of these viruses on human infections. Comparatively less effort, however, has been made to study the way these viruses interact with mosquitoes themselves. As ingested arboviruses infect their midgut and subsequently other tissue, the mosquito mounts a multifaceted innate immune response. RNA interference, the central intracellular antiviral defense mechanism in mosquitoes and other invertebrates can be induced and modulated through outside triggers (small RNAs) and treatments (transgenesis or viral-vector delivery). Accordingly, modulation of this facet of the mosquito’s immune system would thereby suggest a practical strategy for vector control. However, this requires a detailed understanding of mosquitoes’ endogenous small RNAs and their effects on the mosquito and viral proliferation. This paper provides an up-to-date overview of the mosquito’s immune system along with novel data describing miRNA profiles for Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasiatus in Grenada, West Indies.

TI  - Apoptosis during ZIKA Virus Infection: Too Soon or Too Late?
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 23
AB  - Cell death by apoptosis is a major cellular response in the control of tissue homeostasis and as a defense mechanism in the case of cellular aggression such as an infection. Cell self-destruction is part of antiviral responses, aimed at limiting the spread of a virus. Although it may contribute to the deleterious effects in infectious pathology, apoptosis remains a key mechanism for viral clearance and the resolution of infection. The control mechanisms of cell death processes by viruses have been extensively studied. Apoptosis can be triggered by different viral determinants through different pathways as a result of virally induced cell stresses and innate immune responses. Zika virus (ZIKV) induces Zika disease in humans, which has caused severe neurological forms, birth defects, and microcephaly in newborns during the last epidemics. ZIKV also surprised by revealing an ability to persist in the genital tract and in semen, thus being sexually transmitted. Mechanisms of diverting antiviral responses such as the interferon response, the role of cytopathic effects and apoptosis in the etiology of the disease have been widely studied and debated. In this review, we examined the interplay between ZIKV infection of different cell types and apoptosis and how the virus deals with this cellular response. We illustrate a duality in the effects of ZIKV-controlled apoptosis, depending on whether it occurs too early or too late, respectively, in neuropathogenesis, or in long-term viral persistence. We further discuss a prospective role for apoptosis in ZIKV-related therapies, and the use of ZIKV as an oncolytic agent.

TI  - Assessing the Potential Interactions between Cellular miRNA and Arboviral Genomic RNA in the Yellow Fever Mosquito, Aedes aegypti
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - Although the role of exogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA) and P-element induced wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathways in mosquito antiviral immunity is increasingly better understood, there is still little knowledge regarding the role of mosquito cellular microRNA (miRNA). Identifying direct interactions between the mosquito miRNAs and the RNA genome of arboviruses and choosing the relevant miRNA candidates to explore resulting antiviral mechanisms are critical. Here, we carried out genomic analyses to identify Aedes aegypti miRNAs that potentially interact with various lineages and genotypes of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses. By using prediction tools with distinct algorithms, several miRNA binding sites were commonly found within different genotypes/and or lineages of each arbovirus. We further analyzed those miRNAs that could target more than one arbovirus, required a low energy threshold to form miRNA-viralRNA (vRNA) complexes, and predicted potential RNA structures using RNAhybrid software. We predicted miRNA candidates that might participate in regulating arboviral replication in Ae. aegypti. Even without any experimental validation, which should be done as a next step, this study can shed further light on the role of miRNA in mosquito innate immunity and targets for future studies.

JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) causes Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) in individuals exposed prenatally. Here, we investigated polymorphisms in VEGFA, PTGS2, NOS3, TNF, and NOS2 genes as risk factors to CZS. Forty children with CZS and forty-eight children who were in utero exposed to ZIKV infection, but born without congenital anomalies, were evaluated. Children with CZS were predominantly infected by ZIKV in the first trimester (p < 0.001) and had mothers with lower educational level (p < 0.001) and family income (p < 0.001). We found higher risk of CZS due the allele rs2297518[A] of NOS2 (OR = 2.28, CI 95% 1.17–4.50, p = 0.015). T allele and TT/CT genotypes of the TNF rs1799724 and haplotypes associated with higher expression of TNF were more prevalent in children with CZS and severe microcephaly (p = 0.029, p = 0.041 and p = 0.030, respectively). Our findings showed higher risk of CZS due ZIKV infection in the first trimester and suggested that polymorphisms in NOS2 and TNF genes affect the risk of CZS and severe microcephaly.

TI  - Association between genetic variants in TREM1, CXCL10, IL4, CXCL8 and TLR7 genes with the occurrence of congenital Zika syndrome and severe microcephaly
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 13
AB  - Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) is a cluster of malformations induced by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and the underline mechanisms involved in its occurrence are yet not fully understood. Along with epidemiological and environmental factors, the genetic host factors are suggested as important to the CZS occurrence and development, however, few studies have evaluated this. This study enrolled a total of 245 individuals in a case–control association study compound a cohort of high specific interest constituted by 75 mothers who had delivered CZS infants, their 76 infants, and 47 mothers that had delivered healthy infants, and their 47 infants. Sixteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms on TREM1, CXCL10, IL4, CXCL8, TLR3, TLR7, IFNR1, CXCR1, IL10, CCR2 and CCR5 genes were genotyped to investigate their association as risk factors to CZS. The results show an association between C allele at TREM1 rs2234246 and C allele at IL4 rs224325 in mothers infected with ZIKV during pregnancy, with the increased susceptibility to CZS occurrence in their infants and the SNP CXCL8 rs4073 and the G allele at CXCL10 rs4508917 with presence of CZS microcephaly in the infants. Furthermore, the T allele at CXCL8 rs4073 and TRL7 rs179008 SNPs were associated with the severity of microcephaly in children with CZS. These results suggest that these polymorphisms in genes of innate immune responses addressed here are associated to increased risk of occurrence and severity of CZS in pregnant mothers infected with ZIKV and their CZS infants.

AB  - Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) is a cluster of malformation and the mechanisms that lead it are still unclear. Using hypothesis-driven candidate genes and their function in viral infections, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) were genotyped by qPCR in a sample population from Sergipe State, Brazil. This study shows that rs3775291 SNP at TLR3, that trigger to type I interferons antiviral responses, in mothers infected by Zika during pregnancy is associated with CZS occurrence (OR2.19, 95% CI1.158 - 4.148). Moreover, the rs1799964 SNP at TNFα gene in the CZS babies is associated with severe microcephaly (OR2.63, 95% CI 1.13 - 6.21).

TI  - Association of high pressure and alkaline condition for solubilization of inclusion bodies and refolding of the NS1 protein from zika virus
JF  - BMC Biotechnology
VL  - 18
AB  - BackgroundProteins in inclusion bodies (IBs) present native-like secondary structures. However, chaotropic agents at denaturing concentrations, which are widely used for IB solubilization and subsequent refolding, unfold these secondary structures. Removal of the chaotropes frequently causes reaggregation and poor recovery of bioactive proteins. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and alkaline pH are two conditions that, in the presence of low level of chaotropes, have been described as non-denaturing solubilization agents. In the present study we evaluated the strategy of combination of HHP and alkaline pH on the solubilization of IB using as a model an antigenic form of the zika virus (ZIKV) non-structural 1 (NS1) protein.ResultsPressure-treatment (2.4 kbar) of NS1-IBs at a pH of 11.0 induced a low degree of NS1 unfolding and led to solubilization of the IBs, mainly into monomers. After dialysis at pH 8.5, NS1 was refolded and formed soluble oligomers. High (up to 68 mg/liter) NS1 concentrations were obtained by solubilization of NS1-IBs at pH 11 in the presence of arginine (Arg) with a final yield of approximately 80% of total protein content. The process proved to be efficient, quick and did not require further purification steps. Refolded NS1 preserved biological features regarding reactivity with antigen-specific antibodies, including sera of ZIKV-infected patients. The method resulted in an increase of approximately 30-fold over conventional IB solubilization-refolding methods.ConclusionsThe present results represent an innovative non-denaturing protein refolding process by means of the concomitant use of HHP and alkaline pH. Application of the reported method allowed the recovery of ZIKV NS1 at a condition that maintained the antigenic properties of the protein.

TI  - Associations of DNA Methylation Mortality Risk Markers with Congenital Microcephaly from Zika Virus: A Study of Brazilian Children Less than 4 Years of Age.
JF  - Journal of tropical pediatrics
VL  - 67 1
AB  - BACKGROUND
Zika virus (ZIKV)-associated congenital microcephaly is an important contributor to pediatric death, and more robust pediatric mortality risk metrics are needed to help guide life plans and clinical decision making for these patients. Although common etiologies of pediatric and adult mortality differ, early life health can impact adult outcomes-potentially through DNA methylation. Hence, in this pilot study, we take an early step in identifying pediatric mortality risk metrics by examining associations of ZIKV infection and associated congenital microcephaly with existing adult DNA methylation-based mortality biomarkers: GrimAge and Zhang's mortality score (ZMS).


METHODS
Mortality measures were calculated from previously published HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip data from 44 Brazilian children aged 5-40 months (18 with ZIKV-associated microcephaly; 7 normocephalic, exposed to ZIKV in utero; and 19 unexposed controls). We used linear models adjusted for chronological age, sex, methylation batch and white blood cell proportions to evaluate ZIKV and mortality marker relationships.


RESULTS
We observed significant decreases in GrimAge-component plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1; β = -2453.06 pg/ml, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3652.96, -1253.16, p = 0.0002], and ZMS-site cg14975410 methylation (β = -0.06, 95% CI -0.09, -0.03, p = 0.0003) among children with microcephaly compared to controls. PAI-1 (β = -2448.70 pg/ml, 95% CI -4384.45, -512.95, p = 0.01) and cg14975410 (β = 0.01, 95% CI -0.04, 0.06, p = 0.64) results in comparisons of normocephalic, ZIKV-exposed children to controls were not statistically significant.


CONCLUSION
Our results suggest that elements of previously-identified adult epigenetic markers of mortality risk are associated with ZIKV-associated microcephaly, a known contributor to pediatric mortality risk. These findings may provide insights for efforts aimed at developing pediatric mortality markers.

TI  - Astrocytes derived from neural progenitor cells are susceptible to Zika virus infection
JF  - PLOS ONE
VL  - 18
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in 1947. From its isolation until 2007, symptoms of ZIKV-caused disease were limited (e.g., fever, hives, and headache); however, during the epidemic in Brazil in 2014, ZIKV infection caused Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults and microcephaly in fetuses and infants of women infected during pregnancy. The neurovirulence of ZIKV has been studied using neural progenitor cells (NPCs), brain organoids, neurons, and astrocytes. NPCs and astrocytes appear to be the most susceptible cells of the Central Nervous System to ZIKV infection. In this work, we aimed to develop a culture of astrocytes derived from a human NPC cell line. We analyze how ZIKV affects human astrocytes and demonstrate that 1) ZIKV infection reduces cell viability, increases the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and results in high viral titers; 2) there are changes in the expression of genes that facilitate the entry of the virus into the cells; 3) there are changes in the expression of genes involved in the homeostasis of the glutamatergic system; and 4) there are ultrastructural changes in mitochondria and lipid droplets associated with production of virions. Our findings reveal new evidence of how ZIKV compromises astrocytic functionality, which may help understand the pathophysiology of ZIKV-associated congenital disease.

TI  - Atlastin Endoplasmic Reticulum-Shaping Proteins Facilitate Zika Virus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging virus associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, and fetal microcephaly as well as other neurological complications. There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment against ZIKV. We found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-shaping atlastin proteins (ATL1, -2, and -3), which induce ER membrane fusion, facilitate ZIKV replication. We show that ATL3 is recruited to the viral replication site and colocalize with the viral proteins NS2A and NS2B3. The results provide insights into host factors used by ZIKV to enhance its replication. ABSTRACT The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site for Zika virus (ZIKV) replication and is central to the cytopathic effects observed in infected cells. ZIKV induces the formation of ER-derived large cytoplasmic vacuoles followed by “implosive” cell death. Little is known about the nature of the ER factors that regulate flavivirus replication. Atlastins (ATL1, -2, and -3) are dynamin-related GTPases that control the structure and the dynamics of the ER membrane. We show here that ZIKV replication is significantly decreased in the absence of ATL proteins. The appearance of infected cells is delayed, the levels of intracellular viral proteins and released virus are reduced, and the cytopathic effects are strongly impaired. We further show that ATL3 is recruited to viral replication sites and interacts with the nonstructural viral proteins NS2A and NS2B3. Thus, proteins that shape and maintain the ER tubular network ensure efficient ZIKV replication. IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging virus associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, and fetal microcephaly as well as other neurological complications.

TI  - Atovaquone Inhibits Arbovirus Replication through the Depletion of Intracellular Nucleotides
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - The ability to protect vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and children from Zika virus and other arbovirus infections is essential to preventing the devastating complications induced by these viruses. One class of antiviral therapies may lie in known pregnancy-acceptable drugs that have the potential to mitigate arbovirus infections and disease, yet this has not been explored in detail. In this study, we show that the common antiparasitic drug atovaquone inhibits arbovirus replication through intracellular nucleotide depletion and can impair ZIKV infection in an ex vivo human placental explant model. Our study provides a novel function for atovaquone and highlights that the rediscovery of pregnancy-acceptable drugs with potential antiviral effects can be the key to better addressing the immediate need for treating viral infections and preventing potential birth complications and future disease. ABSTRACT Arthropod-borne viruses represent a significant public health threat worldwide, yet there are few antiviral therapies or prophylaxes targeting these pathogens. In particular, the development of novel antivirals for high-risk populations such as pregnant women is essential to prevent devastating disease such as that which was experienced with the recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas. One potential avenue to identify new and pregnancy-acceptable antiviral compounds is to repurpose well-known and widely used FDA-approved drugs. In this study, we addressed the antiviral role of atovaquone, an FDA Pregnancy Category C drug and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor used for the prevention and treatment of parasitic infections. We found that atovaquone was able to inhibit ZIKV and chikungunya virus virion production in human cells and that this antiviral effect occurred early during infection at the initial steps of viral RNA replication. Moreover, we were able to complement viral replication and virion production with the addition of exogenous pyrimidine nucleosides, indicating that atovaquone functions through the inhibition of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway to inhibit viral replication. Finally, using an ex vivo human placental tissue model, we found that atovaquone could limit ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner, providing evidence that atovaquone may function as an antiviral in humans. Taken together, these studies suggest that atovaquone could be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug and a potential attractive candidate for the prophylaxis or treatment of arbovirus infection in vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women and children. IMPORTANCE The ability to protect vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and children from Zika virus and other arbovirus infections is essential to preventing the devastating complications induced by these viruses.

TI  - Autoimmune Neurological Conditions Associated With Zika Virus Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus rapidly spreading throughout the tropical Americas. Aedes mosquitoes is the principal way of transmission of the virus to humans. ZIKV can be spread by transplacental, perinatal, and body fluids. ZIKV infection is often asymptomatic and those with symptoms present minor illness after 3 to 12 days of incubation, characterized by a mild and self-limiting disease with low-grade fever, conjunctivitis, widespread pruritic maculopapular rash, arthralgia and myalgia. ZIKV has been linked to a number of central and peripheral nervous system injuries such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), transverse myelitis (TM), meningoencephalitis, ophthalmological manifestations, and other neurological complications. Nevertheless, mechanisms of host-pathogen neuro-immune interactions remain incompletely elucidated. This review provides a critical discussion about the possible mechanisms underlying the development of autoimmune neurological conditions associated with Zika virus infection.

TI  - Automated SSHHPS Analysis Predicts a Potential Host Protein Target Common to Several Neuroinvasive (+)ssRNA Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Within the viral genome, short stretches of homologous host pathogen sequences (SSHHPS) span the protease cleavage sites. To identify host proteins that may be cleaved during infection, we searched the human proteome for viral protease cleavage sites (~20 amino acids). We developed a sequence-to-symptom tool, automating the search and pairing process. We used the viral protein sequence, PHI-BLAST, and UniProt database for gene ontologies and disease relationships. We applied the tool to nine neuroinvasive viruses: Venezuelan and Eastern Equine encephalitis virus (VEEV, EEEV); severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, SARS-CoV-2); Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); EV-71; Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV); West Nile (WNV); and Zika (ZIKV). A comparison of the hits identified a protein common to all nine viruses called ADGRA2 (GPR124). ADGRA2 was a predicted hit of the 3CL main protease and papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. ADGRA2 is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor and a key endothelial regulator of brain-specific angiogenesis. It is a Wnt7A/Wnt7B specific coactivator of beta-catenin signaling and is essential for blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. We show the cleavage of the predicted sequences in MYOM1, VWF by the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro; DNAH8 (dynein) by the MERS PLpro; ADGRA2 by the alphaviral VEEV nsP2 protease; and POT1 by the SARS-CoV-2 and MERS PLpro.

TI  - Autophagy Contributes to Host Immunity and Protection against Zika Virus Infection via Type I IFN Signaling
JF  - Mediators of Inflammation
VL  - 2020
AB  - Recent studies have indicated that the Zika virus (ZIKV) has a significant impact on the fetal brain, and autophagy is contributing to host immune response and defense against virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that ZIKV infection triggered increased LC3 punctuation in mouse monocyte-macrophage cell line (RAW264.7), mouse microglial cell line (BV2), and hindbrain tissues, proving the occurrence of autophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, manual intervention of autophagy, like deficiency inhibited by 3-MA, can reduce viral clearance in RAW264.7 cells upon ZIKV infection. Besides, specific siRNA strategy confirmed that autophagy can be activated through Atg7-Atg5 and type I IFN signaling pathway upon ZIKV infection, while knocking down of Atg7 and Atg5 effectively decreased the ZIKV clearance in phagocytes. Furthermore, we analyzed that type I IFN signaling could contribute to autophagic clearance of invaded ZIKV in phagocytes. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that ZIKV-induced autophagy is favorable to activate host immunity, particularly through type I IFN signaling, which participates in host protection and defense against ZIKV infection.

TI  - Autophagy in Zika Virus Infection: A Possible Therapeutic Target to Counteract Viral Replication
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 20
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) still constitutes a public health concern, however, no vaccines or therapies are currently approved for treatment. A fundamental process involved in ZIKV infection is autophagy, a cellular catabolic pathway delivering cytoplasmic cargo to the lysosome for degradation—considered as a primordial form of innate immunity against invading microorganisms. ZIKV is thought to inhibit the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, which causes aberrant activation of autophagy promoting viral replication and propagation. It is therefore appealing to study the role of autophagic molecular effectors during viral infection to identify potential targets for anti-ZIKV therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Autophagy, EVs, and Infections: A Perfect Question for a Perfect Time
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - Autophagy, a highly conserved process, serves to maintain cellular homeostasis in response to an extensive variety of internal and external stimuli. The classic, or canonical, pathway of autophagy involves the coordinated degradation and recycling of intracellular components and pathogenic material. Proper regulation of autophagy is critical to maintain cellular health, as alterations in the autophagy pathway have been linked to the progression of a variety of physiological and pathological conditions in humans, namely in aging and in viral infection. In addition to its canonical role as a degradative pathway, a more unconventional and non-degradative role for autophagy has emerged as an area of increasing interest. This process, known as secretory autophagy, is gaining widespread attention as many viruses are believed to use this pathway as a means to release and spread viral particles. Moreover, secretory autophagy has been found to intersect with other intracellular pathways, such as the biogenesis and secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Here, we provide a review of the current landscape surrounding both degradative autophagy and secretory autophagy in relation to both aging and viral infection. We discuss their key features, while describing their interplay with numerous different viruses (i.e. hepatitis B and C viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, SV40, herpesviruses, HIV, chikungunya virus, dengue virus, Zika virus, Ebola virus, HTLV, Rift Valley fever virus, poliovirus, and influenza A virus), and compare secretory autophagy to other pathways of extracellular vesicle release. Lastly, we highlight the need for, and emphasize the importance of, more thorough methods to study the underlying mechanisms of these pathways to better advance our understanding of disease progression.

TI  - Autophagy-mediated downregulation of AXL and TIM-1 promotes sustained Zika virus infection
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 122
AB  - Significance Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been associated with severe birth defects, yet the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM-1) and found that they promote ZIKV entry but are downregulated by the virus infection. We identified several ZIKV proteins involved in AXL and TIM-1 down-regulation through an autophagy-mediated process. Mechanistically, this loss of surface receptors protects host cells from superinfection and cell death, while dampening the innate immune response, ultimately promoting viral spread. Our results contribute to a better understanding of ZIKV’s interactions with host cells and offer insight into viral entry, innate signaling, and pathogenesis.

EP  - 2068
AB  - Recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak has been associated with a sharp increase in cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome and severe fetal abnormalities. However, the mechanism underlying the interaction of ZIKV with host cells is not yet clear. Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is postulated as a receptor for ZIKV entry; however, its in vivo role during ZIKV infection and its impact on the outcome of the disease have not been fully characterized and evaluated. Moreover, there are contradictory results on its involvement in ZIKV infection. Here we utilized Axl-deficient mice (Axl−/−) and their littermates (Axl+/−) to study the in vivo role of Axl in ZIKV infection. Our results showed that both Axl+/− and Axl−/− suckling mice supported the replication of ZIKV and presented clinical manifestations. No significant difference has been found between Axl-deficient mice and their littermates in terms of the survival rate, clinical manifestations, viral load, ZIKV distribution and histopathological changes in major organs. These results therefore indicate that Axl is not an indispensable factor for ZIKV infection in mice.

TI  - Axl Promotes Zika Virus Entry and Modulates the Antiviral State of Human Sertoli Cells
JF  - mBio
VL  - 10
AB  - Recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks have identified sexual transmission as a new route of disease spread not reported for other flaviviruses. ZIKV crosses the blood-testis barrier and establishes infection in seminiferous tubules, the site for spermatozoa development. Currently, there are no therapies to treat ZIKV infection, and the immune mechanisms underlying testicular persistence are unclear. We found that multiple human testicular cell types, except Leydig cells, support ZIKV infection. Axl receptor, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the immunosuppressive milieu of the testis, is highly expressed in Sertoli cells and augments ZIKV infection by promoting virus entry and negatively regulating the antiviral state. By using testicular organoids, we further describe the antiviral role of Axl inhibition. The significance of our research lies in defining cross talk between Axl and type I interferon signaling as an essential mechanism of immune control that can inform therapeutic efforts to clear ZIKV from the testis. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is unique among mosquito-borne flaviviruses in its ability to be sexually transmitted. Persistent ZIKV infection in the testes, which are immune privileged organs, long after peripheral clearance suggests involvement of immunosuppressive pathways; however, the underlying mechanisms remain undetermined. We recently demonstrated that ZIKV infects human Sertoli cells (SC), the major cell type of the seminiferous epithelium responsible for maintaining the immune privileged compartment of seminiferous tubules. Recent reports have identified the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) receptor tyrosine kinase Axl as an entry receptor and/or immune modulator for ZIKV in a cell type-specific manner. Interestingly, the seminiferous epithelium exhibits high basal expression of the Axl receptor where it is involved in clearance of apoptotic germ cells and immunosuppression. Here, we show that Axl was highly expressed in SC compared to Leydig cells (LC) that correlated with robust ZIKV infection of SC, but not LC. Further, neutralization of Axl receptor and its ligand Gas6 strongly attenuated virus entry in SC. However, inhibition of Axl kinase did not affect ZIKV entry but instead led to decreased protein levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), and reduced ZIKV replication. Similarly, treatment of multicellular human testicular organoids with an Axl kinase inhibitor attenuated ZIKV replication and increased ISG expression. Together, our data demonstrate that Axl promotes ZIKV entry and negatively regulates the antiviral state of SC to augment ZIKV infection of the testes and provides new insights into testis antiviral immunity and ZIKV persistence. IMPORTANCE Recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks have identified sexual transmission as a new route of disease spread not reported for other flaviviruses. ZIKV crosses the blood-testis barrier and establishes infection in seminiferous tubules, the site for spermatozoa development. Currently, there are no therapies to treat ZIKV infection, and the immune mechanisms underlying testicular persistence are unclear. We found that multiple human testicular cell types, except Leydig cells, support ZIKV infection. Axl receptor, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the immunosuppressive milieu of the testis, is highly expressed in Sertoli cells and augments ZIKV infection by promoting virus entry and negatively regulating the antiviral state. By using testicular organoids, we further describe the antiviral role of Axl inhibition. The significance of our research lies in defining cross talk between Axl and type I interferon signaling as an essential mechanism of immune control that can inform therapeutic efforts to clear ZIKV from the testis.

TI  - AXL Promotes Zika Virus Infection in Astrocytes by Antagonizing Type I Interferon Signaling Pathway
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
AB  - 
 Zika virus (ZIKV) is known to be associated with neonate microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome in human adults. Despite the progress on understanding the causal link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly, the life cycle and pathogenesis of ZIKV remains elusive. In particular, recent studies have revealed a controversial role of AXL, a TAM family kinase receptor previously deemed as the entry receptor of ZIKV. In this study, we show that though genetic ablation of AXL protects primary human astrocytes and U-251MG astrocytoma cells from ZIKV infection, AXL knockout (KO) does not block the entry of ZIKV, instead it facilitates the up-regulation of type I interferon (IFN) signaling genes, including interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), a key interferon transcriptional factor, and a number of type I interferon and interferon stimulating genes (ISGs). Knockout of type I IFN receptor a chain (IFNAR1) rescues the vulnerability of AXL KO astrocytes to ZIKV infection. In addition, AXL KO in astrocytes results in the down-regulation of SOCS1 in primary astrocytes and the failure to retain the homeostasis of SOCS1 in astrocyte cell lines, a known inhibitor of type I IFN signaling pathway, thus revealing important roles of AXL in maintaining the homeostasis of SOCS1 and thereby in containing type I interferon signaling pathway. Taken together, our study demonstrates that AXL does not function as the sole, if at all, entry receptor of ZIKV, but instead promotes ZIKV infection in astrocytes by SOCS1-mediated antagonism of type I interferon (IFN) signaling.

TI  - AXL, an Important Host Factor for DENV and ZIKV Replication
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Flaviviruses, as critically important pathogens, are still major public health problems all over the world. For instance, the evolution of ZIKV led to large-scale outbreaks in the Yap island in 2007. DENV was considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the 10 threats to global health in 2019. Enveloped viruses hijack a variety of host factors to complete its replication cycle. Phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor, AXL, is considered to be a candidate receptor for flavivirus invasion. In this review, we discuss the molecular structure of ZIKV and DENV, and how they interact with AXL to successfully invade host cells. A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms of flavivirus-AXL interaction will provide crucial insights into the virus infection process and the development of anti-flavivirus therapeutics.

AB  - RATIONALE
The mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) is now recognized as a blood-borne pathogen, raising an important question about how the virus gets into human bloodstream. The imminent threat of the ZIKV epidemic to the global blood supply also demands novel therapeutics to stop virus transmission though transfusion.


OBJECTIVE
We intend to characterize ZIKV tropism for human endothelial cells (ECs) and provide potential targets for intervention.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We conducted immunostaining, plaque assay, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of ZIKV RNA to evaluate the possible infection of ECs by ZIKV. Both the African and the South American ZIKV strains readily infect human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human ECs derived from aortic and coronary artery, as well as the saphenous vein. Infected ECs released infectious progeny virus. Compared with the African strains, South American ZIKV isolates replicate faster in ECs and are partially cytopathic, suggesting enhanced virulence of these isolates. Flow cytometric analyses showed that the susceptibility of ECs positively correlated with the cell surface levels of tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO (AXL) receptor tyrosine kinase. Gain- and loss-of-function studies further revealed that AXL is required for ZIKV entry at a postbinding step. Finally, small-molecule inhibitors of the AXL kinase significantly reduced ZIKA infection of ECs.


CONCLUSIONS
We identified EC as a key cell type for ZIKV infection. These data support the view of hematogenous dissemination of ZIKV and implicate AXL as a new target for antiviral therapy.

TI  - Azelnidipine Exhibits In Vitro and In Vivo Antiviral Effects against Flavivirus Infections by Targeting the Viral RdRp
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Flaviviruses, represented by Zika and dengue virus (ZIKV and DENV), are widely present around the world and cause various diseases with serious consequences. However, no antiviral drugs have been clinically approved for use against them. Azelnidipine (ALP) is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and has been approved for use as an antihypertensive drug. In the present study, ALP was found to show potent anti-flavivirus activities in vitro and in vivo. ALP effectively prevented the cytopathic effect induced by ZIKV and DENV and inhibited the production of viral RNA and viral protein in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, treatment with 0.3 mg/kg of ALP protected 88.89% of mice from lethal challenge. Furthermore, using the time-of-drug-addition assay, the enzymatic inhibition assay, the molecular docking, and the surface plasmon resonance assay, we revealed that ALP acted at the replication stage of the viral infection cycle by targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These findings highlight the potential for the use of ALP as an antiviral agent to combat flavivirus infections.

AB  - Azithromycin (AZM) is a widely used antibiotic, with additional antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties that remain poorly understood. Although Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a significant threat to global health, there are currently no vaccines or effective therapeutics against it. Here, we report that AZM effectively suppresses ZIKV infection in vitro by targeting a late stage in the viral life cycle. ABSTRACT Azithromycin (AZM) is a widely used antibiotic, with additional antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties that remain poorly understood. Although Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a significant threat to global health, there are currently no vaccines or effective therapeutics against it. Here, we report that AZM effectively suppresses ZIKV infection in vitro by targeting a late stage in the viral life cycle. In addition, AZM upregulates the expression of host type I and III interferons and several of their downstream interferon-stimulated genes in response to ZIKV infection. In particular, we found that AZM upregulated the expression of MDA5 and RIG-I (pathogen recognition receptors induced by ZIKV infection) and increased the levels of phosphorylated TBK1 and IRF3. Interestingly, AZM treatment upregulated the phosphorylation of TBK1 without inducing the phosphorylation of IRF3 by itself. These findings highlight the potential use of AZM as a broad antiviral agent to combat viral infection and to prevent devastating ZIKV-associated clinical outcomes, such as congenital microcephaly.

TI  - BAF45b Is Required for Efficient Zika Virus Infection of HAP1 Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - The 2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic illustrates the impact of flaviviruses as emerging human pathogens. For unknown reasons, ZIKV replicates more efficiently in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) than in postmitotic neurons. Here, we identified host factors used by ZIKV using the NCI-60 library of cell lines and COMPARE analysis, and cross-analyzed this library with two other libraries of host factors with importance for ZIKV infection. We identified BAF45b, a subunit of the BAF (Brg1/Brm-associated factors) protein complexes that regulate differentiation of NPCs to post-mitotic neurons. ZIKV (and other flaviviruses) infected HAP1 cells deficient in expression of BAF45b and other BAF subunits less efficiently than wildtype (WT) HAP1 cells. We concluded that subunits of the BAF complex are important for infection of ZIKV and other flavivirus. Given their function in cell and tissue differentiation, such regulators may be important determinants of tropism and pathogenesis of arthropod-borne flaviviruses.

TI  - Basal expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 drives intrinsic hepatocyte resistance to multiple RNA viruses
JF  - Nature microbiology
VL  - 4
SP  - 1096
EP  - 1104
AB  - Current models of cell-intrinsic immunity to RNA viruses centre on virus-triggered inducible antiviral responses initiated by RIG-I-like receptors or Toll-like receptors that sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and signal downstream through interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), transcription factors that induce synthesis of type I and type III interferons1. RNA viruses have evolved sophisticated strategies to disrupt these signalling pathways and evade elimination by cells, attesting to their importance2. Less attention has been paid to how IRFs maintain basal levels of protection against viruses. Here, we depleted antiviral factors linked to RIG-I-like receptor and Toll-like receptor signalling to map critical host pathways restricting positive-strand RNA virus replication in immortalized hepatocytes and identified an unexpected role for IRF1. We show that constitutively expressed IRF1 acts independently of mitochondrial antiviral signalling (MAVS) protein, IRF3 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-dependent signalling to provide intrinsic antiviral protection in actinomycin D-treated cells. IRF1 localizes to the nucleus, where it maintains the basal transcription of a suite of antiviral genes that protect against multiple pathogenic RNA viruses, including hepatitis A and C viruses, dengue virus and Zika virus. Our findings reveal an unappreciated layer of hepatocyte-intrinsic immunity to these positive-strand RNA viruses and identify previously unrecognized antiviral effector genes. Using a short-hairpin RNA-based depletion strategy coupled with high throughput RNA sequencing, the authors unravel a layer of intrinsic immunity to positive-strand RNA viruses in immortalized hepatocytes that relies on basal expression levels of interferon regulatory factor 1 maintaining the transcription of a suite of antiviral genes.

TI  - Basic insights into Zika virus infection of neuroglial and brain endothelial cells
JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 101
SP  - 622
EP  - 634
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently emerged as an important human pathogen due to the strong evidence that it causes disease of the central nervous system, particularly microcephaly and Guillain–Barré syndrome. The pathogenesis of disease, including mechanisms of neuroinvasion, may include both invasion via the blood–brain barrier and via peripheral (including cranial) nerves. Cellular responses to infection are also poorly understood. This study characterizes the in vitro infection of laboratory-adapted ZIKV African MR766 and two Asian strains of (1) brain endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3 cell line) and (2) olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) (the neuroglia populating cranial nerve I and the olfactory bulb; both human and mouse OEC lines) in comparison to kidney epithelial cells (Vero cells, in which ZIKV infection is well characterized). Readouts included infection kinetics, intracellular virus localization, viral persistence and cytokine responses. Although not as high as in Vero cells, viral titres exceeded 104 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) ml−1 in the endothelial/neuroglial cell types, except hOECs. Despite these substantial titres, a relatively small proportion of neuroglial cells were primarily infected. Immunolabelling of infected cells revealed localization of the ZIKV envelope and NS3 proteins in the cytoplasm; NS3 staining overlapped with that of dsRNA replication intermediate and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Infected OECs and endothelial cells produced high levels of pro-inflammatory chemokines. Nevertheless, ZIKV was also able to establish persistent infection in hOEC and hCMEC/D3 cells. Taken together, these results provide basic insights into ZIKV infection of endothelial and neuroglial cells and will form the basis for further study of ZIKV disease mechanisms.

TI  - Benzenesulfonamide Derivatives as Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Inhibitors and Antiviral Agents Against Dengue and Zika Virus Infections.
JF  - Journal of medicinal chemistry
AB  - Emerging and resurging mosquito-borne flaviviruses are an important public health challenge. The increased prevalence of dengue virus (DENV) infection has had a significant socio-economic impact on epidemic countries. The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) has created an international public health emergency because ZIKV infection has been linked to congenital defects and Guillain-Barré syndrome. To develop potentially antiviral drugs for combatting these acute infectious diseases, we have targeted the host calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) for inhibition. By using CaMKII structure-guided inhibitor design, we generated four families of benzenesulfonamide (BSA) derivatives for SAR analysis. Among these substances, N-(4-cycloheptyl-4-oxobutyl)-4-methoxy-N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide (9) showed superior properties as a lead CaMKII inhibitor and antiviral agent. BSA 9 inhibited CaMKII activity with an IC50 value of 0.79 µM and displayed EC50 values of 1.52 µM and 1.91 µM against DENV and ZIKV infections of human neuronal BE(2)C cells, respectively. Notably, 9 significantly reduced the viremia level and increased animal survival time in mouse-challenge models.

TI  - Berberine inhibitory action against zika and dengue viruses in cell cultures
JF  - Acta Virologica
AB  - Berberine (BBR) is a plant derived isoquinoline alkaloid that displays a great variety of biological activities. In this study we showed that BBR exhibits a strong antiviral activity with broad spectrum of inhibition against different strains of Zika virus (ZIKV) and the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) in Vero cells. The inhibitory effect of BBR on ZIKV and DENV-2 growth was also demonstrated in human cell lines. The analysis of BBR mode of action showed that the compound did not affect early events of viral multiplication cycle or viral protein expression. By contrast, BBR strongly impaired the formation of intracellular and extracellular infectious viral particles. Furthermore, BBR was able to inhibit ZIKV induced activation of ERK1/2 and p38 cell signaling pathways and also reduced p38 phosphorylation in uninfected cells. Like BBR, the p38 inhibitor SB202190 reduced p38 phosphorylation in both uninfected and ZIKV infected cultures and caused a significant diminishment of viral yields even when it was added late during the infection. These results suggest for the first time that the inhibitory effect of BBR on p38 signaling might contribute to the antiviral action of the compound against flaviviruses.

AB  - Mosquito transmitted viruses, particularly those of the genus Flavivirus, are a significant healthcare burden worldwide, especially in tropical and sub-tropical areas. However, effective medicines for these viral infections remains lacking. Berberine (BBR) is an alkaloid found in some plants used in traditional medicines in Southeast Asia and elsewhere, and BBR has been shown to possess anti-viral activities. During a screen for potential application to mosquito transmitted viruses, BBR was shown to have virucidal activity against dengue virus (DENV; IC50 42.87 µM) as well as against Zika virus (IC50 11.42 µM) and chikungunya virus (IC50 14.21 µM). BBR was shown to have cellular effects that lead to an increase in cellular DENV E protein without a concomitant effect on DENV nonstructural proteins, suggesting an effect on viral particle formation or egress. While BBR was shown to have an effect of ERK1/2 activation this did not result in defects in viral egress mechanisms. The primary effect of BBR on viral production was likely to be through BBR acting through AMPK activation and disruption of lipid metabolism. Combined these results suggest that BBR has a dual effect on DENV infection, and BBR may have the potential for development as an anti-DENV antiviral.

AB  - Flaviviruses, such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, are critically important human pathogens that sicken a staggeringly high number of humans every year. Most of these pathogens are transmitted by mosquitos, and not surprisingly, as the earth warms and human populations grow and move, their geographic reach is increasing. Flaviviruses are simple RNA-protein machines that carry out protein synthesis, genome replication, and virion packaging in close association with cellular lipid membranes. In this review, we examine the molecular biology of flaviviruses touching on the structure and function of viral components and how these interact with host factors. The latter are functionally divided into pro-viral and antiviral factors, both of which, not surprisingly, include many RNA binding proteins. In the interface between the virus and the hosts we highlight the role of a noncoding RNA produced by flaviviruses to impair antiviral host immune responses. Throughout the review, we highlight areas of intense investigation, or a need for it, and potential targets and tools to consider in the important battle against pathogenic flaviviruses.

TI  - Blockade of Autocrine CCL5 Responses Inhibits Zika Virus Persistence and Spread in Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells
JF  - mBio
VL  - 12
AB  - Our findings demonstrate that CCL5 is required for ZIKV to persistently infect human brain ECs that normally protect neuronal compartments. We demonstrate that ZIKV-elicited CCL5 secretion directs autocrine hBMEC activation of ERK1/2 survival pathways via CCR3/CCR5, and inhibiting CCL5/CCR3/CCR5 responses prevented ZIKV persistence and spread. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurovirulent flavivirus that uniquely causes fetal microcephaly, is sexually transmitted, and persists in patients for up to 6 months. ZIKV persistently infects human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) that form the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enables viral spread to neuronal compartments. We found that CCL5, a chemokine with prosurvival effects on immune cells, was highly secreted by ZIKV-infected hBMECs. Although roles for CCL5 in endothelial cell (EC) survival remain unknown, the presence of the CCL5 receptors CCR3 and CCR5 on ECs suggested that CCL5 could promote ZIKV persistence in hBMECs. We found that exogenous CCL5 induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in hBMECs and that ERK1/2 cell survival signaling was similarly activated by ZIKV infection. Neutralizing antibodies to CCL5, CCR3, or CCR5 inhibited persistent ZIKV infection of hBMECs. While knockout (KO) of CCL5 failed to prevent ZIKV infection of hBMECs, at 3 days postinfection (dpi), we observed a >90% reduction in ZIKV-infected CCL5-KO hBMECs and a multilog reduction in ZIKV titers. In contrast, the addition of CCL5 to CCL5-KO hBMECs dose-dependently rescued ZIKV persistence in hBMECs. Inhibiting CCL5 responses using CCR3 (UCB35625) and CCR5 (maraviroc) receptor antagonists reduced the number of ZIKV-infected hBMECs and ZIKV titers (50% inhibitory concentrations [IC50s] of 2.5 to 12 μM), without cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC50] of >80 μM). These findings demonstrate that ZIKV-induced CCL5 directs autocrine CCR3/CCR5 activation of ERK1/2 survival responses that are required for ZIKV to persistently infect hBMECs. Our results establish roles for CCL5 in ZIKV persistence and suggest the potential for CCL5 receptor antagonists to therapeutically inhibit ZIKV spread and neurovirulence. IMPORTANCE Our findings demonstrate that CCL5 is required for ZIKV to persistently infect human brain ECs that normally protect neuronal compartments. We demonstrate that ZIKV-elicited CCL5 secretion directs autocrine hBMEC activation of ERK1/2 survival pathways via CCR3/CCR5, and inhibiting CCL5/CCR3/CCR5 responses prevented ZIKV persistence and spread. Our findings demonstrate that ZIKV-directed CCL5 secretion promotes hBMEC survival and reveals an underlying mechanism of ZIKV pathogenesis and spread. We demonstrate that antagonists of CCR3/CCR5 inhibit ZIKV persistence in hBMECs and provide potential therapeutic approaches for preventing ZIKV persistence, spread, and neurovirulence.

TI  - BPIFB3 facilitates flavivirus infection by controlling RETREG1-dependent reticulophagy
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The flavivirus genus, which includes dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), are significant human pathogens and the prevalence of infected vectors continues to geographically expand. Both DENV and ZIKV rely on expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the induction of autophagy to establish a productive viral infection. However, little is known regarding the interplay between the requirements for autophagy initiation during infection and the mechanisms used by these viruses to avoid clearance through the autophagic pathway. We recently showed that DENV and ZIKV inhibit reticulophagy (specific degradation of the ER through autophagy) by cleaving reticulophagy regulator 1 (RETREG1), an autophagy receptor responsible for targeted ER sheet degradation. These data suggest that DENV and ZIKV require specific autophagic pathways for their replication, while other autophagic pathways are antiviral. We previously identified BPI Fold Containing Family B Member 3 (BPIFB3) as a regulator of autophagy that negatively controls enterovirus replication. Here, we show that in contrast to enteroviruses, BPIFB3 functions as a positive regulator of DENV and ZIKV infection and that its RNAi-mediated silencing drastically inhibits the formation of viral replication organelles. We show that BPIFB3 depletion enhances ER fragmentation, while its overexpression protects against autophagy-induced ER degradation, demonstrating that BPIFB3 serves as a specific regulator of ER turnover. We further show that the antiviral effects of BPIFB3 depletion on flavivirus infection are reversed in RETREG1-depleted cells, and that BPIFB3 associates with RETREG1 within the ER, suggesting that BPIFB3 regulates a RETREG1-specific reticulophagy pathway. Collectively, these studies identify BPIFB3 as a regulator of the reticulophagy pathway and define the requirements for a novel host regulator of flavivirus infection. Author Summary Flaviviruses and other arthropod transmitted viruses represent a widespread global health problem with limited treatment options currently available. Thus, greater knowledge of the host factors required for replication and transmission is needed to provide a better understanding of the cellular requirements for infection. Here, we show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein, BPIFB3 is required to facilitate flavivirus infection. Depletion of BPIFB3 in cells inhibits dengue virus and Zika virus infection prior to replication of the viral genome. Mechanistically, we show that BPIFB3 inhibits ER degradation in an autophagy-specific manner and that loss of BPIFB3 decreases the availability of ER membranes needed for flavivirus replication. We further show that BPIFB3 specifically regulates the RETREG1 pathway, but not other pathways of ER turnover. Together, our data define a previously uncharacterized method of regulating ER degradation and show that BPIFB3 is an essential host factor for a productive flavivirus infection.

AB  - Flaviviruses and other arthropod-transmitted viruses represent a widespread global health problem, with limited treatment options currently available. Thus, a better understanding of the cellular requirements for their infection is needed. Both DENV and ZIKV rely on expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the induction of autophagy to establish productive infections. However, little is known regarding the interplay between the requirements for autophagy initiation during infection and the mechanisms used by these viruses to avoid clearance through the autophagic pathway. Our study highlights the importance of the host factor BPIFB3 in regulating flavivirus replication and further confirms that the RETREG1-dependent reticulophagy pathway is antiviral to both DENV and ZIKV. ABSTRACT Flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), rely heavily on the availability of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes throughout their life cycle, and degradation of ER membranes restricts flavivirus replication. Accordingly, DENV and ZIKV restrict ER turnover by protease-mediated cleavage of reticulophagy regulator 1 (RETREG1), also known as FAM134B, an autophagy receptor responsible for targeted ER sheet degradation. Given that the induction of autophagy may play an important role in flavivirus replication, the antiviral role of RETREG1 suggests that specialized autophagic pathways may have differential effects on the flavivirus life cycle. We previously identified BPI fold-containing family B member 3 (BPIFB3) as a regulator of autophagy that negatively controls enterovirus replication. Here, we show that in contrast to enteroviruses, BPIFB3 functions as a positive regulator of DENV and ZIKV infection and that its RNA interference-mediated silencing inhibits the formation of viral replication organelles. Mechanistically, we show that depletion of BPIFB3 enhances RETREG1-dependent reticulophagy, leading to enhanced ER turnover and the suppression of viral replication. Consistent with this, the antiviral effects of BPIFB3 depletion can be reversed by RETREG1 silencing, suggesting a specific role for BPIFB3 in regulating ER turnover. These studies define BPIFB3 as a required host factor for both DENV and ZIKV replication and further contribute to our understanding of the requirements for autophagy during flavivirus infection.

AB  - After recent reports attesting a straight correlation between Zika infection and brain disorders in new-borns, research questions now focus on establishing causality and the mechanisms underlying it. Studies involving monolayer cultures, murine and human brain tissue slices and the cerebral organoid system have provided important information regarding neuronal damage, but the precise mechanisms underlying neuronal cell tropism and cell damage have not been elucidated. Herein, we discuss the possibility that Zika virus proteins enter the nucleus by a brief search for nuclear signal localization and for potential nucleosome binding motifs using a bioinformatics approach and point to other questions that should be the focus of research aiming to understand Zika-virus associated cell-damage.

TI  - Broadly Antiviral Activities of TAP1 through Activating the TBK1-IRF3-Mediated Type I Interferon Production
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 22
AB  - Deeply understanding the virus-host interaction is a prerequisite for developing effective anti-viral strategies. Traditionally, the transporter associated with antigen processing type 1 (TAP1) is critical for antigen presentation to regulate adaptive immunity. However, its role in controlling viral infections through modulating innate immune signaling is not yet fully understood. In the present study, we reported that TAP1, as a product of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), had broadly antiviral activity against various viruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), adenoviruses (AdV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and influenza virus (PR8) etc. This antiviral activity by TAP1 was further confirmed by series of loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments. Our further investigation revealed that TAP1 significantly promoted the interferon (IFN)-β production through activating the TANK binding kinase-1 (TBK1) and the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling transduction. Our work highlighted the broadly anti-viral function of TAP1 by modulating innate immunity, which is independent of its well-known function of antigen presentation. This study will provide insights into developing novel vaccination and immunotherapy strategies against emerging infectious diseases.

TI  - c-FLIP facilitates ZIKV infection by mediating caspase-8/3-dependent apoptosis
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 20
AB  - c-FLIP functions as a dual regulator of apoptosis and inflammation, yet its implications in Zika virus (ZIKV) infection remain partially understood, especially in the context of ZIKV-induced congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) where both apoptosis and inflammation play pivotal roles. Our findings demonstrate that c-FLIP promotes ZIKV infection in placental cells and myeloid-derived macrophages, involving inflammation and caspase-8/3-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, our observations reveal that c-FLIP augments ZIKV infection in multiple tissues, including blood cell, spleen, uterus, testis, and the brain of mice. Notably, the partial deficiency of c-FLIP provides protection to embryos against ZIKV-induced CZS, accompanied by a reduction in caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. Additionally, we have found a distinctive parental effect of c-FLIP influencing ZIKV replication in fetal heads. In summary, our study reveals the critical role of c-FLIP as a positive regulator in caspase-8/3-mediated apoptosis during ZIKV infection, significantly contributing to the development of CZS.

TI  - C19orf66 interrupts Zika virus replication by inducing lysosomal degradation of viral NS3
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 14
AB  - The rapidly emerging human health crisis associated with the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic and its link to severe complications highlights the growing need to identify the mechanisms by which ZIKV accesses hosts. Interferon response protects host cells against viral infection, while the cellular factors that mediate this defense are the products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified, only a few have been characterized for their antiviral potential, target specificity and mechanisms of action. In this work, we focused our investigation on the possible antiviral effect of a novel ISG, C19orf66 in response to ZIKV infection and the associated mechanisms. We found that ZIKV infection could induce C19orf66 expression in ZIKV-permissive cells, and such an overexpression of C19orf66 remarkably suppressed ZIKV replication. Conversely, the depletion of C19orf66 led to a significant increase in viral replication. Furthermore, C19orf66 was found to interact and co-localize with ZIKV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3), thus inducing NS3 degradation via a lysosome-dependent pathway. Taken together, this study identified C19orf66 as a novel ISG that exerts antiviral effects against ZIKV by specifically degrading a viral nonstructural protein. These findings uncovered an intriguing mechanism of C19orf66 that targeting NS3 protein of ZIKV, providing clues for understanding the actions of innate immunity, and affording the possible availability of new drug targets that can be used for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Can We Better Understand How Zika Leads to Microcephaly? A Systematic Review of the Effects of the Zika Virus on Human Brain Organoids
JF  - The Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 219
SP  - 734–745
EP  - 
AB  - BACKGROUND
The innovative human brain organoid model represents a unique opportunity to better understand the genesis of congenital brain abnormalities, particularly microcephaly, caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during early pregnancy.


METHODS
A systematic review was conducted to investigate how ZIKV leads to microcephaly in a novel experimental model that mimics early brain development. Studies were gathered by searching MEDLINE/Pubmed, LILACS, and LiSSa for reports on effects of ZIKV infection on human brain organoids. From 146 identified papers, 13 articles were selected for review.


RESULTS
This review found that ZIKV of African, Latin American, and Asian lineages caused productive replication after 72 hours, preferentially infected neural progenitor cells over mature neurons, reduced both cell populations, and caused premature differentiation. Limited data involving only African and Latin American lineages showed a reduction in populations of proliferating cells and intermediate cells, and overall decreased viability. Furthermore, all 3 lineages caused heightened apoptosis and reduced organoid size.


CONCLUSIONS
This review concludes that, in organoids, ZIKV causes productive replication, infects neural progenitor cells over mature neurons, decreases both populations, causes premature differentiation, induces apoptosis, and reduces size.

TI  - Capsid protein is central to the birth of flavivirus particles
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - Flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are enveloped, positivesense single-stranded RNA viruses. Upon entry into a host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, the virus particle undergoes low-pH–driven endosomal membrane fusion to release its genome into the cytoplasm [1]. This viral genome is then translated into a single polyprotein that is coand post-translationally processed into 3 structural and 7 nonstructural proteins. The 3 structural proteins that form the immature virus particle are the Capsid (C), Envelope (E), and precursor Membrane (prM) proteins. After formation of the core, consisting of the C protein complexed with the newly synthesized viral RNA genome, the core then buds into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane decorated with membrane-anchored viral E and prM proteins, forming an immature virus (Fig 1A). The immature virion then undergoes maturation during transport through the secretory pathway (Fig 1B). This involves large conformational rearrangements of the E proteins (Fig 2A), which enhances the cleavage of the prM to M protein by furin proteases (Fig 1C) to generate the infectious mature virus particle (Fig 1D).

TI  - Capsid protein structure in Zika virus reveals the flavivirus assembly process
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 11
AB  - Structures of flavivirus (dengue virus and Zika virus) particles are known to near-atomic resolution and show detailed structure and arrangement of their surface proteins (E and prM in immature virus or M in mature virus). By contrast, the arrangement of the capsid proteins:RNA complex, which forms the core of the particle, is poorly understood, likely due to inherent dynamics. Here, we stabilize immature Zika virus via an antibody that binds across the E and prM proteins, resulting in a subnanometer resolution structure of capsid proteins within the virus particle. Fitting of the capsid protein into densities shows the presence of a helix previously thought to be removed via proteolysis. This structure illuminates capsid protein quaternary organization, including its orientation relative to the lipid membrane and the genomic RNA, and its interactions with the transmembrane regions of the surface proteins. Results show the capsid protein plays a central role in the flavivirus assembly process. The structure of flavivirus surface proteins has been elucidated, but the conformation of capsid proteins within particles is less clear. Here, the authors provide a subnanometer resolution structure of Zika virus capsid protein within the virus particle, elucidating its quaternary organization and role in flavivirus packaging.

TI  - Caspase-1/11 controls Zika virus replication in astrocytes by inhibiting glycolytic metabolism.
JF  - The FEBS journal
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a significant threat due to its association with severe neurological complications, particularly during pregnancy. Although viruses exhibit tropism for neural cells, including astrocytes, the role of these cells in controlling ZIKV replication remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that ZIKV induces caspase-1 activation in primary astrocytes despite the absence of classical signs of inflammasome activation. Caspase-1 and caspase-11 double knockout (caspase-1/11-/-) astrocytes exhibit heightened permissiveness to viral replication, accompanied by overactivation of glycolytic metabolism. Inhibition of glycolysis reversed the susceptibility of caspase-1/11-/- astrocytes to ZIKV infection. Protein network analysis revealed mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) as a link between proteins involved in glycolysis and caspase-1, and mTORC inhibition also suppressed viral replication. Furthermore, we found that the impact of caspase-1/11 on astrocytes depends on the regulation of pyruvate transport to mitochondria for viral replication. Overall, our findings elucidate a caspase-1/11-dependent microbicidal mechanism in astrocytes that involves the mTORC/glycolytic pathway/pyruvate axis, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for ZIKV infection.

TI  - CD24 Expression Dampens the Basal Antiviral State in Human Neuroblastoma Cells and Enhances Permissivity to Zika Virus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) exhibits distinct selectivity for infection of various cells and tissues, but how host cellular factors modulate varying permissivity remains largely unknown. Previous studies showed that the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-AS (expressing low levels of cellular protein CD24) was highly restricted for ZIKV infection, and that this restriction was relieved by ectopic expression of CD24. We tested the hypothesis that CD24 expression allowed ZIKV replication by suppression of the antiviral response. SK-N-AS cells expressing an empty vector (termed CD24-low cells) showed elevated basal levels of phosphorylated STAT1, IRF-1, IKKE, and NFκB. In response to exogenously added type I interferon (IFN-I), CD24-low cells had higher-level induction of antiviral genes and activity against two IFN-I-sensitive viruses (VSV and PIV5-P/V) compared to SK-N-AS cells with ectopic CD24 expression (termed CD24-high cells). Media-transfer experiments showed that the inherent antiviral state of CD24-low cells was not dependent on a secreted factor such as IFN-I. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that CD24 expression decreased expression of genes involved in intracellular antiviral pathways, including IFN-I, NFκB, and Ras. Our findings that CD24 expression in neuroblastoma cells represses intracellular antiviral pathways support the proposal that CD24 may represent a novel biomarker in cancer cells for susceptibility to oncolytic viruses.

TI  - CD8+ T cells promote ZIKV clearance and mitigate testicular damage in mice
JF  - npj Viruses
VL  - 2
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) causes human testicular inflammation and alterations in sperm parameters and causes testicular damage in mouse models. The involvement of individual immune cells in testicular damage is not fully understood. We detected virus in the testes of the interferon (IFN) α/β receptor−/− A129 mice three weeks post-infection and found elevated chemokines in the testes, suggesting chronic inflammation and long-term infection play a role in testicular damage. In the testes, myeloid cells and CD4+ T cells were absent at 7 dpi but were present at 23 days post-infection (dpi), and CD8+ T cell infiltration started at 7 dpi. CD8−/− mice with an antibody-depleted IFN response had a significant reduction in spermatogenesis, indicating that CD8+ T cells are essential to prevent testicular damage during long-term ZIKV infections. Our findings on the dynamics of testicular immune cells and the importance of CD8+ T cells function as a framework to understand mechanisms underlying observed inflammation and sperm alterations in humans.

JF  - Infection and Drug Resistance
VL  - 12

EP  - 2921
AB  - Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus that is transmitted by Aedes mosquitos. Its prototype was isolated in 1947 from serum of a sentinel Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) in the Zika forest of Uganda. As a member of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, ZIKV is enveloped and icosahedral and possesses a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 10.7 kb. Epidemiologically, infection by ZIKV has become a global health concern in recent years because of the occurrence of epidemics, its speed of dissemination, routes of transmission, and the sequelae it can cause especially in newborns. At the neural level, there are still many gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms that induce ZIKV infection-associated microcephaly. However, some studies already demonstrated that underlying cell death is determinant to induce the congenital malformation. In this report, we reviewed the various mechanisms of cell injury involved in the immunopathogenesis of ZIKV infection and discussed its relationship with the death of neuronal and glial cells development and microcephaly.

TI  - Cell surface α2,3-linked sialic acid facilitates Zika virus internalization
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 8
SP  - 426
EP  - 437
AB  - ABSTRACT The emergence of neurotropic Zika virus (ZIKV) raised a public health emergency of global concern. ZIKV can cross the placental barrier and infect foetal brains, resulting in microcephaly, but the pathogenesis of ZIKV is poorly understood. With recent findings reporting AXL as a type I interferon antagonist rather than an entry receptor, the exact entry mechanism remains unresolved. Here we report that cell surface sialic acid plays an important role in ZIKV infection. Removal of cell surface sialic acid by neuraminidase significantly abolished ZIKV infection in Vero cells and human induced-pluripotent stem cells-derived neural progenitor cells. Furthermore, knockout of the sialic acid biosynthesis gene encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase resulted in significantly less ZIKV infection of both African and Asian lineages. Huh7 cells deficient in α2,3-linked sialic acid through knockout of ST3 β-galactoside-α2,3-sialyltransferase 4 had significantly reduced ZIKV infection. Removal of membrane-bound, un-internalized virus with pronase treatment revealed the role of sialic acid in ZIKV internalization but not attachment. Sialyllactose inhibition studies showed that there is no direct interaction between sialic acid and ZIKV, implying that sialic acid could be mediating ZIKV-receptor complex internalization. Identification of α2,3-linked sialic acid as an important host factor for ZIKV internalization provides new insight into ZIKV infection and pathogenesis.

TI  - Cell-Fusing Agent Virus Reduces Arbovirus Dissemination in Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes In Vivo
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti carries several arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that are pathogenic to humans, including dengue and Zika viruses. Interestingly, A. aegypti is also naturally infected with insect-only viruses, such as cell-fusing agent virus. Although interactions between cell-fusing agent virus and dengue virus have been documented in mosquito cells in culture, whether wild strains of cell-fusing agent virus interfere with arbovirus transmission by live mosquitoes was unknown. We used an experimental approach to demonstrate that cell-fusing agent virus infection reduces the propagation of dengue and Zika viruses in A. aegypti mosquitoes. These results support the idea that insect-only viruses in nature can modulate the ability of mosquitoes to carry arboviruses of medical significance and that they could possibly be manipulated to reduce arbovirus transmission. ABSTRACT Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the main vectors of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of public health significance, such as the flaviviruses dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Mosquitoes are also the natural hosts of a wide range of viruses that are insect specific, raising the question of their influence on arbovirus transmission in nature. Cell-fusing agent virus (CFAV) was the first described insect-specific flavivirus, initially discovered in an A. aegypti cell line and subsequently detected in natural A. aegypti populations. It was recently shown that DENV and the CFAV strain isolated from the A. aegypti cell line have mutually beneficial interactions in mosquito cells in culture. However, whether natural strains of CFAV and DENV interact in live mosquitoes is unknown. Using a wild-type CFAV isolate recently derived from Thai A. aegypti mosquitoes, we found that CFAV negatively interferes with both DENV type 1 and ZIKV in vitro and in vivo. For both arboviruses, prior infection by CFAV reduced the dissemination titer in mosquito head tissues. Our results indicate that the interactions observed between arboviruses and the CFAV strain derived from the cell line might not be a relevant model of the viral interference that we observed in vivo. Overall, our study supports the hypothesis that insect-specific flaviviruses may contribute to reduce the transmission of human-pathogenic flaviviruses.

TI  - Cell-type- and region-specific restriction of neurotropic flavivirus infection by viperin
JF  - Journal of Neuroinflammation
VL  - 15
AB  - Flaviviruses are a group of diverse and emerging arboviruses and an immense global health problem. A number of flaviviruses are neurotropic, causing severe encephalitis and even death. Type I interferons (IFNs) are the first line of defense of the innate immune system against flavivirus infection. IFNs elicit the concerted action of numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to restrict both virus infection and replication. Viperin (virus-inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated, IFN-inducible) is an ISG with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple flaviviruses in vitro. Its activity in vivo restricts neurotropic infections to specific regions of the central nervous system (CNS). However, the cell types in which viperin activity is required are unknown. Here we have examined both the regional and cell-type specificity of viperin in the defense against infection by several model neurotropic flaviviruses. Viral burden and IFN induction were analyzed in vivo in wild-type and viperin−/− mice infected with Langat virus (LGTV). The effects of IFN pretreatment were tested in vitro in primary neural cultures from different brain regions in response to infection with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Viperin activity restricted nonlethal LGTV infection in the spleen and the olfactory bulb following infection via a peripheral route. Viperin activity was also necessary to restrict LGTV replication in the olfactory bulb and the cerebrum following CNS infection, but not in the cerebellum. In vitro, viperin could restrict TBEV replication in primary cortical neurons, but not in the cerebellar granule cell neurons. Interferon-induced viperin was also very important in primary cortical neurons to control TBEV, WNV, and ZIKV. Our findings show that viperin restricts replication of neurotropic flaviviruses in the CNS in a region- and cell-type-specific manner. The most important sites of activity are the olfactory bulb and cerebrum. Activity within the cerebrum is required in the cortical neurons in order to restrict spread. This study exemplifies cell type and regional diversity of the IFN response within the CNS and shows the importance of a potent broad-spectrum antiviral ISG.

TI  - Cellular NONO protein binds to the flavivirus replication complex and promotes positive-strand RNA synthesis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 98
AB  - ABSTRACT A cellular protein, non-POU-domain-containing octamer binding protein (NONO), bound to the replication complex of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) by directly interacting with the viral 3’ UTR RNA and NS3 protein. These interactions were also identified in West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). The infection of JEV or the expression of JEV NS3 protein in cells could induce relocation of NONO protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In JEV-infected cells, the NS3, NS5, and viral RNA could be concurrently detected in the immunoprecipitation by the NONO-specific antibody, suggesting that NONO could integrate into the replication complex of JEV. Further results of co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that NONO protein interacted with NS3 helicase domains 1 and 2 by its two RNA recognize motifs (RRMs). The knockdown and knockout of NONO in cells could significantly reduce the replication of JEV and ZIKV but had no effect on the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The effect of NONO protein on JEV proliferation occurred during the replication stage, rather than the attachment and entry stages. The level of viral positive-strand RNA in NONO knockout cells was significantly reduced than that in wild-type cells at 12–48 h post-JEV infection. However, the level of negative-strand virus RNA had no difference between NONO knockout and wild-type cells at 12–24 h post-infection. In summary, our study identified a cellular protein that bound to the replication complex of flavivirus and facilitated the synthesis of positive-strand RNA. IMPORTANCE Over half of the world’s population is at risk of flaviviruses infection, posing a serious global health concern. To date, there are no antiviral drugs or treatments for the severe symptoms caused by the infection of flaviviruses. Some cellular proteins could participate in the replication of virus, and these cellular proteins were also ideal targets in antiviral strategy. Here, we identified cellular NONO protein was recruited by flavivirus NS3 protein to the cytoplasm, serving as a “scaffold” for viral replication complex. Our findings also revealed that NONO protein was critical for flavivirus positive-strand RNA synthesis. Specific areas where NONO interacted with flavivirus NS3 proteins and viral UTRs have also been identified. These results propose a new mechanism for cellular protein to participate in flavivirus replication and also raise a new potential anti-flavivirus strategy.

TI  - Cellular Organelles Reorganization During Zika Virus Infection of Human Cells
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an enveloped positive stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae that emerged in recent decades causing pandemic outbreaks of human infections occasionally associated with severe neurological disorders in adults and newborns. The intracellular steps of flavivirus multiplication are associated to cellular membranes and their bound organelles leading to an extensive host cell reorganization. Importantly, the association of organelle dysfunction with diseases caused by several human viruses has been widely reported in recent studies. With the aim to increase the knowledge about the impact of ZIKV infection on the host cell functions, the present study was focused on the evaluation of the reorganization of three cell components, promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), mitochondria, and lipid droplets (LDs). Relevant human cell lines including neural progenitor cells (NPCs), hepatic Huh-7, and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were infected with the Argentina INEVH116141 ZIKV strain and the organelle alterations were studied by using fluorescent cell imaging analysis. Our results have shown that these three organelles are targeted and structurally modified during ZIKV infection. Considering the nuclear reorganization, the analysis by confocal microscopy of infected cells showed a significantly reduced number of PML-NBs in comparison to uninfected cells. Moreover, a mitochondrial morphodynamic perturbation with an increased fragmentation and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was observed in ZIKV infected RPE cells. Regarding lipid structures, a decrease in the number and volume of LDs was observed in ZIKV infected cells. Given the involvement of these organelles in host defense processes, the reported perturbations may be related to enhanced virus replication through protection from innate immunity. The understanding of the cellular remodeling will enable the design of new host-targeted antiviral strategies.

TI  - Changes in ADAR RNA editing patterns in CMV and ZIKV congenital infections
JF  - BMC Genomics
VL  - 24
AB  - Background RNA editing is a process that increases transcriptome diversity, often through Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA (ADARs) that catalyze the deamination of adenosine to inosine. ADAR editing plays an important role in regulating brain function and immune activation, and is dynamically regulated during brain development. Additionally, the ADAR1 p150 isoform is induced by interferons in viral infection and plays a role in antiviral immune response. However, the question of how virus-induced ADAR expression affects host transcriptome editing remains largely unanswered. This question is particularly relevant in the context of congenital infections, given the dynamic regulation of ADAR editing during brain development, the importance of this editing for brain function, and subsequent neurological symptoms of such infections, including microcephaly, sensory issues, and other neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Here, we begin to address this question, examining ADAR expression in publicly available datasets of congenital infections of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) microarray expression data, as well as mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and mouse/ human induced pluripotent neuroprogenitor stem cell (hiNPC) Zika virus (ZIKV) RNA-seq data. Results We found that in all three datasets, ADAR1 was overexpressed in infected samples compared to uninfected samples. In the RNA-seq datasets, editing rates were also analyzed. In all mouse infections cases, the number of editing sites was significantly increased in infected samples, albeit this was not the case for hiNPC ZIKV samples. Mouse ZIKV samples showed altered editing of well-established protein-recoding sites such as Gria3, Grik5, and Nova1, as well as editing sites that may impact miRNA binding. Conclusions Our findings provide evidence for changes in ADAR expression and subsequent dysregulation of ADAR editing of host transcriptomes in congenital infections. These changes in editing patterns of key neural genes have potential significance in the development of neurological symptoms, thus contributing to neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Further experiments should be performed to explore the full range of editing changes that occur in different congenital infections, and to confirm the specific functional consequences of these editing changes.

In this study, we investigated the interaction between ZIKV and primary human brain cortical astrocytes (HBCA). HBCAs were highly sensitive to representatives of both Asian and African ZIKV lineages and produced high viral yields. The infection was associated with limited immune cytokine/chemokine response activation; the highest increase of expression, following infection, was seen in CXCL-10 (IP-10), interleukin-6, 8, 12, and CCL5 (RANTES). Ultrastructural changes in the ZIKV-infected HBCA were characterized by electron tomography (ET). ET reconstructions elucidated high-resolution 3D images of the proliferating and extensively rearranged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) containing viral particles and virus-induced vesicles, tightly juxtaposed to collapsed ER cisternae. The results confirm that human astrocytes are sensitive to ZIKV infection and could be a source of proinflammatory cytokines in the ZIKV-infected brain tissue.

EP  - 4318
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) suddenly evolved from a neglected arthropod‐borne flavivirus into a pandemic pathogen during 2015–2016. A panel of amino acid mutations has been shown to be responsible for the enhanced neurovirulence and transmissibility of ZIKV. Recent studies have demonstrated that ZIKV genomic RNA is modified by host N6‐methyladenosine (m6A) machinery during viral replication in host cells, and the m6A profiles vary among different isolates and different host cells. In the present study, using a contemporary Asian ZIKV strain isolated in 2019 (SZ1901) as a model, we profiled m6A modifications on both the viral genome RNA and cellular transcripts from the ZIKV‐infected human hepatocarcinoma cell line Huh7. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP‐seq) identified a unique m6A map in the genome of ZIKV strain SZ1901 that is different from all previous isolates. Meanwhile, ZIKV infection induced m6A upregulation in the CDS regions but downregulation in the 3′ untranslated region of host RNA transcripts. The m6A peak intensity in the majority of host genes was downregulated, including ISG‐related genes. Overall, our study describes unique viral and host m6A profiles in contemporary ZIKV‐infected Huh7 cells, highlighting the complexity and importance of m6A modification during viral infection.

TI  - Characterization of the Zika virus induced small RNA response in Aedes aegypti cells
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 11
AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) controls arbovirus infections in mosquitoes. Two different RNAi pathways are involved in antiviral responses: the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) and exogenous short interfering RNA (exo-siRNA) pathways, which are characterized by the production of virus-derived small RNAs of 25–29 and 21 nucleotides, respectively. The exo-siRNA pathway is considered to be the key mosquito antiviral response mechanism. In Aedes aegypti-derived cells, Zika virus (ZIKV)-specific siRNAs were produced and loaded into the exo-siRNA pathway effector protein Argonaute 2 (Ago2); although the knockdown of Ago2 did not enhance virus replication. Enhanced ZIKV replication was observed in a Dcr2-knockout cell line suggesting that the exo-siRNA pathway is implicated in the antiviral response. Although ZIKV-specific piRNA-sized small RNAs were detected, these lacked the characteristic piRNA ping-pong signature motif and were bound to Ago3 but not Piwi5 or Piwi6. Silencing of PIWI proteins indicated that the knockdown of Ago3, Piwi5 or Piwi6 did not enhance ZIKV replication and only Piwi4 displayed antiviral activity. We also report that the expression of ZIKV capsid (C) protein amplified the replication of a reporter alphavirus; although, unlike yellow fever virus C protein, it does not inhibit the exo-siRNA pathway. Our findings elucidate ZIKV-mosquito RNAi interactions that are important for understanding its spread.

TI  - Characterization of Zika Virus Endocytic Pathways in Human Glioblastoma Cells
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infections can cause microcephaly and neurological disorders. However, the early infection events of ZIKV in neural cells remain to be characterized. Here, by using a combination of pharmacological and molecular approaches and the human glioblastoma cell T98G as a model, we first observed that ZIKV infection was inhibited by chloroquine and NH4Cl, indicating a requirement of low intracellular pH. We further showed that dynamin is required as the ZIKV entry was affected by the specific inhibitor dynasore, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of dynamin, or by expressing the dominant-negative K44A mutant. Moreover, the ZIKV entry was significantly inhibited by chlorpromazine, pitstop2, or siRNA knockdown of clathrin heavy chain, indicating an involvement of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, genistein treatment, siRNA knockdown of caveolin-1, or overexpression of a dominant-negative caveolin mutant impacted the ZIKV entry, with ZIKV particles being observed to colocalize with caveolin-1, implying that caveola endocytosis can also be involved. Furthermore, we found that the endocytosis of ZIKV is dependent on membrane cholesterol, microtubules, and actin cytoskeleton. Importantly, ZIKV infection was inhibited by silencing of Rab5 and Rab7, while confocal microscopy showed that ZIKV particles localized in Rab5- and Rab7-postive endosomes. These results indicated that, after internalization, ZIKV likely moves to Rab5-positive early endosome and Rab7-positive late endosomes before delivering its RNA into the cytoplasm. Taken together, our study, for the first time, described the early infection events of ZIKV in human glioblastoma cell T98G.

TI  - Characterizing the Different Effects of Zika Virus Infection in Placenta and Microglia Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 10
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neuropathic virus that causes serious neurological abnormalities such as Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults and congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) in fetuses, which makes it an important concern for global human health. A catalogue of cells that support ZIKV replication, pathogenesis, and/or the persistence of the virus still remains unknown. Here, we studied the behavior of the virus in human placenta (JEG-3) and human microglia (HMC3) cell lines in order to better understand how different host tissues respond during infection. We quantified the host transcriptional response to ZIKV infection in both types of cells at 24 and 72 h post-infection. A panel of 84 genes that are involved in the innate or adaptive immune responses was used to quantify differential expression in both cell lines. HMC3 cells showed a unique set of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared with JEG-3 cells at both time points. Subsequent analysis of these data using modern pathway analysis methods revealed that the TLR7/8 pathway was strongly inhibited in HMC3 cells, while it was activated in JEG-3 cells during virus infection. The disruption of these pathways was subsequently confirmed with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments that characterize their role in the viral life cycle, and may partially explain why ZIKV infection in placental tissue contributes to extreme neurological problems in a developing fetus.

VL  - 11
AB  - Flaviviruses are the most medically relevant group of arboviruses causing a wide range of diseases in humans and are associated with high mortality and morbidity, as such posing a major health concern. Viruses belonging to this family can be endemic (e.g., dengue virus), but can also cause fulminant outbreaks (e.g., West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and Zika virus). Intense research efforts in the past decades uncovered shared fundamental strategies used by flaviviruses to successfully replicate in their respective hosts. However, the distinct features contributing to the specific host and tissue tropism as well as the pathological outcomes unique to each individual flavivirus are still largely elusive. The profound footprint of individual viruses on their respective hosts can be investigated using novel technologies in the field of proteomics that have rapidly developed over the last decade. An unprecedented sensitivity and throughput of mass spectrometers, combined with the development of new sample preparation and bioinformatics analysis methods, have made the systematic investigation of virus–host interactions possible. Furthermore, the ability to assess dynamic alterations in protein abundances, protein turnover rates and post-translational modifications occurring in infected cells now offer the unique possibility to unravel complex viral perturbations induced in the infected host. In this review, we discuss the most recent contributions of mass spectrometry–based proteomic approaches in flavivirus biology with a special focus on Zika virus, and their basic and translational potential and implications in understanding and characterizing host responses to arboviral infections.

TI  - Chemical proteomics tracks virus entry and uncovers NCAM1 as Zika virus receptor
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 11
AB  - The outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in 2016 created worldwide health emergency which demand urgent research efforts on understanding the virus biology and developing therapeutic strategies. Here, we present a time-resolved chemical proteomic strategy to track the early-stage entry of ZIKV into host cells. ZIKV was labeled on its surface with a chemical probe, which carries a photocrosslinker to covalently link virus-interacting proteins in living cells on UV exposure at different time points, and a biotin tag for subsequent enrichment and mass spectrometric identification of the receptor or other host proteins critical for virus internalization. We identified Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM1) as a potential ZIKV receptor and further validated it through overexpression, knockout, and inhibition of NCAM1 in Vero cells and human glioblastoma cells U-251 MG. Collectively, the strategy can serve as a universal tool to map virus entry pathways and uncover key interacting proteins. The mechanism underlying the cellular entry of Zika virus is not fully understood. Here, the authors use a chemically modified virus and time-resolved proteomics to capture interacting host proteins during virus entry and identify NCAM1 as a ZIKV receptor.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in utero might lead to microcephaly and other congenital defects. Since no specific therapy is available thus far, there is an urgent need for the discovery of agents capable of inhibiting its viral replication and deleterious effects. Chloroquine is widely used as an antimalarial drug, anti-inflammatory agent, and it also shows antiviral activity against several viruses. Here we show that chloroquine exhibits antiviral activity against ZIKV in Vero cells, human brain microvascular endothelial cells, human neural stem cells, and mouse neurospheres. We demonstrate that chloroquine reduces the number of ZIKV-infected cells in vitro, and inhibits virus production and cell death promoted by ZIKV infection without cytotoxic effects. In addition, chloroquine treatment partially reveres morphological changes induced by ZIKV infection in mouse neurospheres.

TI  - CHOP Pro-Apoptotic Transcriptional Program in Response to ER Stress Is Hacked by Zika Virus
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 22
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus considered as a threat to human health due to large epidemics and serious clinical outcomes such as microcephaly in new-borns. Like all flaviviruses, ZIKV relies on the cellular machinery to complete its viral cycle, with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) being the critical site of viral replication factories. The sudden high protein load in the ER induces an ER stress to which the cell responds with an appropriate unfolded protein response (UPR) in an attempt to restore its disturbed homeostasis. When the restoration fails, the cell signalling leads to a programmed cell death by apoptosis with the upregulation of the UPR-induced C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) which acts as the main trigger for this fatal outcome. Our previous studies have shown the ability of ZIKV to manipulate various cellular responses in order to optimize virus production. ZIKV is able to delay apoptosis to its benefit and although ER stress is induced, the UPR is not complete. Here we discovered that ZIKV impairs the expression of CHOP/DDIT3, the main factor responsible of ER-stress driven apoptosis. Surprisingly, the mechanism does not take place at the transcriptional level but at the translational level.

JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 47
SP  - 9789
EP  - 9802
AB  - Abstract Members of the Flaviviridae family, including dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus, cause serious disease in humans, whilst maternal infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) can induce microcephaly in newborns. Following infection, flaviviral RNA genomes are translated to produce the viral replication machinery but must then serve as a template for the transcription of new genomes. However, the ribosome and viral polymerase proceed in opposite directions along the RNA, risking collisions and abortive replication. Whilst generally linear, flavivirus genomes can adopt a circular conformation facilitated by long-range RNA–RNA interactions, shown to be essential for replication. Using an in vitro reconstitution approach, we demonstrate that circularization inhibits de novo translation initiation on ZIKV and DENV RNA, whilst the linear conformation is translation-competent. Our results provide a mechanism to clear the viral RNA of ribosomes in order to promote efficient replication and, therefore, define opposing roles for linear and circular conformations of the flavivirus genome.

TI  - Cis autocatalytic cleavage of glycine‐linked Zika virus NS2B‐NS3 protease constructs
JF  - FEBS Letters
VL  - 593
AB  - The flaviviral heterodimeric serine protease NS2B‐NS3, consisting of the NS3 protease domain and the NS2B co‐factor, is essential for ZIKA virus maturation and replication in cells. For in vitro studies a ‘linked’ construct, where a polyglycine linker connects NS2BCF and NS3pro, is often used. This construct undergoes autocatalytic cleavage. Here, we show that linked ZIKV NS2BCF‐NS3pro is cleaved in cis in the NS2BCF exclusively at position R95 and not at the previously proposed alternate cleavage site at residue R29 in the NS3pro. Cleavage neither affects protease stability nor activity, despite some observed differences in spectroscopic behavior. This minimally modified construct may thus be useful for future structural and functional studies of the flaviviral protease, for example when testing new inhibitors.

JF  - Autophagy
VL  - 20
SP  - 2769
EP  - 2784
AB  - ABSTRACT Macroautophagy/autophagy plays a crucial role in inhibiting viral replication and regulating the host’s immune response. The autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) restricts viral replication by directing specific viral proteins to phagophores for degradation. In this study, we investigate the reciprocal relationship between Zika virus (ZIKV) and selective autophagy mediated by SQSTM1/p62. We show that NS2B3 protease encoded by ZIKV cleaves human SQSTM1/p62 at arginine 265 (R265). This cleavage also occurs with endogenous SQSTM1 in ZIKV-infected cells. Furthermore, overexpression of SQSTM1 inhibits ZIKV replication in A549 cells, while its absence increases viral titer. We have also shown that SQSTM1 impedes ZIKV replication by interacting with NS3 and NS5 and directing them to autophagic degradation, and that NS2B3-mediated cleavage could potentially alter this antiviral function of SQSTM1. Taken together, our study highlights the role of SQSTM1-mediated selective autophagy in the host’s antiviral defense against ZIKV and uncovers potential viral evasion strategies that exploit the host’s autophagic machinery to ensure successful infection.

TI  - CLEC5A mediates Zika virus-induced testicular damage
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 30
AB  - Background Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is clinically known to induce testicular swelling, termed orchitis, and potentially impact male sterility, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previous reports suggested that C-type lectins play important roles in mediating virus-induced inflammatory reactions and pathogenesis. We thus investigated whether C-type lectins modulate ZIKV-induced testicular damage. Methods C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A) knockout mice were generated in a STAT1-deficient immunocompromised background (denoted clec5a ^ −/− stat1 ^ −/− ) to enable testing of the role played by CLEC5A after ZIKV infection in a mosquito-to-mouse disease model. Following ZIKV infection, mice were subjected to an array of analyses to evaluate testicular damage, including ZIKV infectivity and neutrophil infiltration estimation via quantitative RT-PCR or histology and immunohistochemistry, inflammatory cytokine and testosterone detection, and spermatozoon counting. Furthermore, DNAX-activating proteins for 12 kDa (DAP12) knockout mice ( dap12 ^ −/− stat1 ^ −/− ) were generated and used to evaluate ZIKV infectivity, inflammation, and spermatozoa function in order to investigate the potential mechanisms engaged by CLEC5A. Results Compared to experiments conducted in ZIKV-infected stat1 ^ −/− mice, infected clec5a ^ −/− stat1 ^ −/− mice showed reductions in testicular ZIKV titer, local inflammation and apoptosis in testis and epididymis, neutrophil invasion, and sperm count and motility. CLEC5A, a myeloid pattern recognition receptor, therefore appears involved in the pathogenesis of ZIKV-induced orchitis and oligospermia. Furthermore, DAP12 expression was found to be decreased in the testis and epididymis tissues of clec5a ^ −/− stat1 ^ −/− mice. As for CLEC5A deficient mice, ZIKV-infected DAP12-deficient mice also showed reductions in testicular ZIKV titer and local inflammation, as well as improved spermatozoa function, as compared to controls. CLEC5A-associated DAP12 signaling appears to in part regulate ZIKV-induced testicular damage. Conclusions Our analyses reveal a critical role for CLEC5A in ZIKV-induced proinflammatory responses, as CLEC5A enables leukocytes to infiltrate past the blood-testis barrier and induce testicular and epididymal tissue damage. CLEC5A is thus a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of injuries to male reproductive organs in ZIKV patients.

TI  - Clustered rapid induction of apoptosis limits ZIKV and DENV-2 proliferation in the midguts of Aedes aegypti
JF  - Communications Biology
VL  - 4
AB  - Inter-host transmission of pathogenic arboviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) requires systemic infection of the mosquito vector. Successful systemic infection requires initial viral entry and proliferation in the midgut cells of the mosquito followed by dissemination to secondary tissues and eventual entry into salivary glands1. Lack of arbovirus proliferation in midgut cells has been observed in several Aedes aegypti strains2, but the midgut antiviral responses underlying this phenomenon are not yet fully understood. We report here that there is a rapid induction of apoptosis (RIA) in the Aedes aegypti midgut epithelium within 2 hours of infection with DENV-2 or ZIKV in both in vivo blood-feeding and ex vivo midgut infection models. Inhibition of RIA led to increased virus proliferation in the midgut, implicating RIA as an innate immune mechanism mediating midgut infection in this mosquito vector. Ayers et al. report rapid induction of apoptosis in the midgut of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes within 2 hours of infection by dengue and Zika viruses, and find that inhibiting apoptosis led to increased virus proliferation in the midgut. These results suggest rapid induction of apoptosis as an innate immune mechanism mediating midgut infection in this mosquito vector.

TI  - CMPK2 restricts Zika virus replication by inhibiting viral translation
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 19
AB  - Flaviviruses continue to emerge as global health threats. There are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antiviral treatments for flaviviral infections. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify host and viral factors that can be targeted for effective therapeutic intervention. Type I interferon (IFN-I) production in response to microbial products is one of the host’s first line of defense against invading pathogens. Cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 2 (CMPK2) is a type I interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that exerts antiviral effects. However, the molecular mechanism by which CMPK2 inhibits viral replication is unclear. Here, we report that CMPK2 expression restricts Zika virus (ZIKV) replication by specifically inhibiting viral translation and that IFN-I- induced CMPK2 contributes significantly to the overall antiviral response against ZIKV. We demonstrate that expression of CMPK2 results in a significant decrease in the replication of other pathogenic flaviviruses including dengue virus (DENV-2), Kunjin virus (KUNV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Importantly, we determine that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of CMPK2, which lacks kinase activity, is sufficient to restrict viral translation. Thus, its kinase function is not required for CMPK2’s antiviral activity. Furthermore, we identify seven conserved cysteine residues within the NTD as critical for CMPK2 antiviral activity. Thus, these residues may form an unknown functional site in the NTD of CMPK2 contributing to its antiviral function. Finally, we show that mitochondrial localization of CMPK2 is required for its antiviral effects. Given its broad antiviral activity against flaviviruses, CMPK2 is a promising potential pan-flavivirus inhibitor.

TI  - Co-factor Influences the Severity of Zika Virus-Associated Microcephaly
AB  - Microcephaly has been regarded the most remarkable consequence of the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Brazil 2015. It remains to be determined whether there are factors that contribute to the degree of brain lesion associated with ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Previous studies showed that socioeconomic conditions correlate with ZIKV-associated microcephaly. Certain nutritional deficits display the potential to interfere in the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which plays a major role in the pathophysiology of ZIKV-associated microcephaly. We hypothesize that a nutritional or environmental co-factor that interferes in mTOR signaling correlates with ZIKV-associated birth defects. To assess this hypothesis, we plan to: 1) develop a mouse model of ZIKV-associated microcephaly through intravenous injection of ZIKV and rapamycin for a straightforward interference on mTOR receptor; 2) determine in the experimental model and in cases of ZIKV-associated microcephaly the epigenetic signature (DNA methylation pattern) in neurons and muscle cells harvested by biopsy, and in hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells sorted from blood; 3) analyze through mass spectrometry in serum of pregnant female mice submitted to ZIKV and rapamycin injection and in serum of mothers of children with ZIKV-associated microcephaly the metabolomic pattern of cholesterol (a nutritional status marker), vitamin A and its metabolite retinoic acid, folate, and other metabolites related to these three nutritional factors; 4) check whether pregnant female mice submitted to intravenous injection of ZIKV and feed with a deficient diet of the most likely co-factor found in this study give birth to microcephalic mice with features that mimic clinical cases. In summary, our general objective is to develop an experimental model that mimics ZIKV-associated microcephaly cases and to find a co-factor involved in the microcephaly outbreak in Brazil 2015.

TI  - Colocalization of m6A and G-Quadruplex-Forming Sequences in Viral RNA (HIV, Zika, Hepatitis B, and SV40) Suggests Topological Control of Adenosine N6-Methylation
JF  - ACS Central Science
VL  - 5
SP  - 218
EP  - 228
AB  - This Outlook calls attention to two seemingly disparate and emerging fields regarding viral genomics that may be correlated in a way previously overlooked. First, we describe identification of conserved potential G-quadruplex-forming sequences (PQSs) in viral genomes relevant to human health. Studies have demonstrated that PQSs are highly conserved and can fold to G-quadruplexes (G4s) to regulate viral processes. Key examples include G4s as a countermeasure to the host’s immune system or G4-guided regulation of replication or transcription. Second, emerging data are discussed concerning the epitranscriptomic modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in viral RNA installed by host proteins in a consensus sequence favoring 5′-GG(m6A)C-3′. The proposed pathways by which m6A is written, read, and erased in viral RNA genomes and the impact this has on viral replication are described. The structural reason why certain sites are selected for modification while others are not is still mysterious. Finally, we discuss our new observations regarding these previous sequencing data that identify m6A installation within the loops of two-tetrad PQSs in the RNA genomes of the Zika, HIV, hepatitis B, and SV40 viruses. We hypothesize that conserved viral PQSs can provide a framework (sequence and/or structural) for m6A installation. We also discuss literature sources suggesting that PQSs as sites of RNA modification could be a general phenomenon. We anticipate our observations will provide ample opportunities for exciting discoveries regarding the interplay between G4 structures and epitranscriptomic modifications of RNA.

TI  - Common arboviruses and the kidney: a review
JF  - Jornal Brasileiro de Nefrologia
VL  - 46
AB  - Abstract Arboviruses are endemic in several countries and represent a worrying public health problem. The most important of these diseases is dengue fever, whose numbers continue to rise and have reached millions of annual cases in Brazil since the last decade. Other arboviruses of public health concern are chikungunya and Zika, both of which have caused recent epidemics, and yellow fever, which has also caused epidemic outbreaks in our country. Like most infectious diseases, arboviruses have the potential to affect the kidneys through several mechanisms. These include the direct action of the viruses, systemic inflammation, hemorrhagic phenomena and other complications, in addition to the toxicity of the drugs used in treatment. In this review article, the epidemiological aspects of the main arboviruses in Brazil and other countries where these diseases are endemic, clinical aspects and the main laboratory changes found, including changes in renal function, are addressed. It also describes how arboviruses behave in kidney transplant patients. The pathophysiological mechanisms of kidney injury associated with arboviruses are described and finally the recommended treatment for each disease and recommendations for kidney support in this context are given.

TI  - Common Dysregulation of Innate Immunity Pathways in Human Primary Astrocytes Infected With Chikungunya, Mayaro, Oropouche, and Zika Viruses
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Arboviruses pose a major threat throughout the world and represent a great burden in tropical countries of South America. Although generally associated with moderate febrile illness, in more severe cases they can lead to neurological outcomes, such as encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and Congenital Syndromes. In this context astrocytes play a central role in production of inflammatory cytokines, regulation of extracellular matrix, and control of glutamate driven neurotoxicity in the central nervous system. Here, we presented a comprehensive genome-wide transcriptome analysis of human primary astrocytes infected with Chikungunya, Mayaro, Oropouche, or Zika viruses. Analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), pathway enrichment, and interactomes have shown that Alphaviruses up-regulated genes related to elastic fiber formation and N-glycosylation of glycoproteins, with down-regulation of cell cycle and DNA stability and chromosome maintenance genes. In contrast, Oropouche virus up-regulated cell cycle and DNA maintenance and condensation pathways while down-regulated extracellular matrix, collagen metabolism, glutamate and ion transporters pathways. Zika virus infection only up-regulated eukaryotic translation machinery while down-regulated interferon pathways. Reactome and integration analysis revealed a common signature in down-regulation of innate immune response, antiviral response, and inflammatory cytokines associated to interferon pathway for all arboviruses tested. Validation of interferon stimulated genes by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) corroborated our transcriptome findings. Altogether, our results showed a co-evolution in the mechanisms involved in the escape of arboviruses to antiviral immune response mediated by the interferon (IFN) pathway.

TI  - Complementary Mechanisms Potentially Involved in the Pathology of Zika Virus
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 9
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a global health threat due to its neuro-teratogenic effect and wide range of transmission routes. Most recently, ZIKV infection has been linked with both autoimmune disorders in adults and neurodevelopmental disorders in newborns. Researchers are exploring potential cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the neuro-teratogenicity and related consequences by using various in vitro cell culture methods and in vivo animal models. Though some of the putative viral entry receptors have been identified for ZIKV entry into the target cells, the exact mechanism of ZIKV entry or induced pathology are still not clear. Some of the important host cellular pathways including the toll-like receptor (TLR), autophagy, apoptosis and unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways are considered potential mechanism(s) for ZIKV induced neuroinflammation and for neurodevelopmental disorders. Since there is still a dire need for efficient treatment and vaccine to prevent ZIKV mediated disorders, a better understanding of the interaction between virus and host cellular pathways could pave the way for development of targeted therapeutic intervention. In this review, we are focusing on the recent advances and current knowledge regarding the interaction of ZIKV with abovementioned pathways so as to provide basic understanding to execute further research that could aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategy.

TI  - Comprehensive Quantitative Proteome Analysis of Aedes aegypti Identifies Proteins and Pathways Involved in Wolbachia pipientis and Zika Virus Interference Phenomenon
JF  - Frontiers in Physiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Zika virus is a global public health emergency due to its association with microcephaly, Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy, and myelitis in children and adults. A total of 87 countries have had evidence of autochthonous mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus, distributed across four continents, and no antivirus therapy or vaccines are available. Therefore, several strategies have been developed to target the main mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, to reduce the burden of different arboviruses. Among such strategies, the use of the maternally-inherited endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis has been applied successfully to reduce virus susceptibility and decrease transmission. However, the mechanisms by which Wolbachia orchestrate resistance to ZIKV infection remain to be elucidated. In this study, we apply isobaric labeling quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantify proteins and identify pathways altered during ZIKV infection; Wolbachia infection; co-infection with Wolbachia/ZIKV in the Ae. aegypti heads and salivary glands. We show that Wolbachia regulates proteins involved in ROS production, regulates humoral immune response, and antioxidant production. The reduction of ZIKV polyprotein in the presence of Wolbachia in mosquitoes was determined by mass spectrometry and corroborates the idea that Wolbachia helps to block ZIKV infections in Ae. aegypti. The present study offers a rich resource of data that may help to elucidate mechanisms by which Wolbachia orchestrate resistance to ZIKV infection in Ae. aegypti, and represents a step further on the development of new targeted methods to detect and quantify ZIKV and Wolbachia directly in complex tissues. Highlights The abundance of ZIKV polyprotein is reduced in the presence of Wolbachia Shotgun proteomics quantifies ZIKV and Wolbachia proteins directly in tissues Wolbachia regulates proteins involved in ROS production Wolbachia regulates humoral immune response and antioxidant production Metabolism and detoxification processes were associated with mono infections

JF  - The EMBO Journal
VL  - 35
SP  - 2170
EP  - 2178
AB  - The association of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections with microcephaly and neurological diseases has highlighted an emerging public health concern. Here, we report the crystal structure of the full‐length ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), a major host‐interaction molecule that functions in flaviviral replication, pathogenesis, and immune evasion. Of note, a long intertwined loop is observed in the wing domain of ZIKV NS1, and forms a hydrophobic “spike”, which can contribute to cellular membrane association. For different flaviviruses, the amino acid sequences of the “spike” are variable but their common characteristic is either hydrophobic or positively charged, which is a beneficial feature for membrane binding. Comparative studies with West Nile and Dengue virus NS1 structures reveal conserved features, but diversified electrostatic characteristics on both inner and outer faces. Our results suggest different mechanisms of flavivirus pathogenesis and should be considered during the development of diagnostic tools.

TI  - Contribution of miR-124 rs531564 polymorphism to the occurrence of congenital Zika syndrome
JF  - Epigenetics
VL  - 18
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) cause Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) in individuals exposed during pregnancy. Studies have shown that ZIKV infection positively regulates the miR-124 expression in neural cells, which leads to a decrease of TFRC, a gene targeted of this miRNA. Both miR-124 and TFRC exhibit a pivotal role in nervous system development. Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate whether genetic variants that affect the expression of these genes could act together with ZIKV to increase the risk of individuals developing CZS. TFRC rs406271 and MIR-124-1 rs531564 polymorphisms were genotyped, using TaqMan® Genotyping Assays, in a sample of children who were exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy, of whom 40 were born with CZS and 48 without congenital anomalies. We identified that individuals with CZS presented a higher frequency of CG genotype of rs531564 polymorphism in MIR-124-1 (p=0.048), which is associated with increased expression of miR-124. Since ZIKV also upregulates the expression of this miRNA, the presence of CG genotype in individuals exposed to the virus could lead to a scenario of overexpression of miR-124 in the brain. Since teratogenesis is a multifactorial event, this genetic finding could partly explain why such individuals are more susceptible to CZS, considering both the downregulation of important neurodevelopment genes, as well as deregulation of the neurogenesis process. Thus, we provide preliminary evidence about a possible genetic risk factor to CZS and highlight the importance of analyzing functional polymorphisms related to epigenetic modulators of neurodevelopment genes in the context of ZIKV teratogenesis.

TI  - Coordination of Zika Virus Infection and Viroplasm Organization by Microtubules and Microtubule-Organizing Centers
JF  - Cells
VL  - 10
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) became a global health concern in 2016 due to its links to congenital microcephaly and other birth defects. Flaviviruses, including ZIKV, reorganize the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to form a viroplasm, a compartment where virus particles are assembled. Microtubules (MTs) and microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) coordinate structural and trafficking functions in the cell, and MTs also support replication of flaviviruses. Here we investigated the roles of MTs and the cell’s MTOCs on ZIKV viroplasm organization and virus production. We show that a toroidal-shaped viroplasm forms upon ZIKV infection, and MTs are organized at the viroplasm core and surrounding the viroplasm. We show that MTs are necessary for viroplasm organization and impact infectious virus production. In addition, the centrosome and the Golgi MTOC are closely associated with the viroplasm, and the centrosome coordinates the organization of the ZIKV viroplasm toroidal structure. Surprisingly, viroplasm formation and virus production are not significantly impaired when infected cells have no centrosomes and impaired Golgi MTOC, and we show that MTs are anchored to the viroplasm surface in these cells. We propose that the viroplasm is a site of MT organization, and the MTs organized at the viroplasm are sufficient for efficient virus production.

TI  - Coupled small molecules target RNA interference and JAK/STAT signaling to reduce Zika virus infection in Aedes aegypti
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 18
AB  - The recent global Zika epidemics have revealed the significant threat that mosquito-borne viruses pose. There are currently no effective vaccines or prophylactics to prevent Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Limiting exposure to infected mosquitoes is best way to reduce disease incidence. Recent studies have focused on targeting mosquito reproduction and immune responses to reduce transmission. In particular, previous work evaluated the effect of insulin signaling on antiviral JAK/STAT and RNAi in vector mosquitoes. In this work, we demonstrate that targeting insulin signaling through the repurposing of small molecule drugs results in the activation of both of these antiviral pathways. Activation of this coordinated response additively reduced ZIKV levels in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. This effect included a quantitatively greater reduction in salivary gland ZIKV levels relative to single pathway activation, indicating the potential for field delivery of these small molecules to substantially reduce virus transmission.

TI  - Crosstalk between RNA Metabolism and Cellular Stress Responses during Zika Virus Replication
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 9
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus associated with neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly. In humans, ZIKV is able to replicate in cell types from different tissues including placental cells, neurons, and microglia. This intricate virus-cell interaction is accompanied by virally induced changes in the infected cell aimed to promote viral replication as well as cellular responses aimed to counteract or tolerate the virus. Early in the infection, the 11-kb positive-sense RNA genome recruit ribosomes in the cytoplasm and the complex is translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for viral protein synthesis. In this process, ZIKV replication is known to induce cellular stress, which triggers both the expression of innate immune genes and the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), shutting-off host protein synthesis. Remodeling of the ER during ZIKV replication also triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which induces changes in the cellular transcriptional landscapes aimed to tolerate infection or trigger apoptosis. Alternatively, ZIKV replication induces changes in the adenosine methylation patterns of specific host mRNAs, which have different consequences in viral replication and cellular fate. In addition, the ZIKV RNA genome undergoes adenosine methylation by the host machinery, which results in the inhibition of viral replication. However, despite these relevant findings, the full scope of these processes to the outcome of infection remains poorly elucidated. This review summarizes relevant aspects of the complex crosstalk between RNA metabolism and cellular stress responses against ZIKV and discusses their possible impact on viral pathogenesis.

TI  - Crystal structure of Zika virus NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 8
AB  - The current Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak became a global health threat of complex epidemiology and devastating neurological impacts, therefore requiring urgent efforts towards the development of novel efficacious and safe antiviral drugs. Due to its central role in RNA viral replication, the non-structural protein 5 (NS5) RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) is a prime target for drug discovery. Here we describe the crystal structure of the recombinant ZIKV NS5 RdRp domain at 1.9 Å resolution as a platform for structure-based drug design strategy. The overall structure is similar to other flaviviral homologues. However, the priming loop target site, which is suitable for non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor design, shows significant differences in comparison with the dengue virus structures, including a tighter pocket and a modified local charge distribution. The Zika virus outbreak is a global health threat and there is an urgent need for drugs against the virus. Here the authors present the structure of the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase domain from Zika non-structural protein 5, which is a template for the design of non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors.

AB  - Two nonstructural proteins encoded by Zika virus strain MR766 RNA, a methyltransferase and a helicase, were crystallized and their structures were solved and refined at 2.10 and 2.01 Å resolution, respectively. The NS5 methyltransferase contains a bound S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) co-substrate. The NS3 helicase is in the apo form. Comparison with published crystal structures of the helicase in the apo, nucleotide-bound and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)-bound states suggests that binding of ssRNA to the helicase may occur through conformational selection rather than induced fit.

SP  - 177
EP  - 183
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), a positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus, has become an urgent public health concern since recent outbreaks worldwide. Its genome replication is facilitated by the viral NS3 protein bearing helicase function. The NS3 helicase uses energy derived from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to unwind RNA duplexed regions. Structural studies of the flavivirus NS3 helicases have suggested a conserved mechanism of ATP hydrolysis. However, the process of the reactant water replenishment, a key part of the hydrolysis cycle, remains elusive. Here, we report two high-resolution crystal structures of ZIKV NS3 helicase in complex with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and Mn2+, one with the reactant water already loaded as previously observed and the other with the water molecule still in a loading state. These data suggest that the reactant water replenishment can occur between the release of phosphate and the release of ADP and improves the structural basis of the NS3 ATP hydrolysis cycle.

VL  - 21
AB  - We report that two laboratory colonies of Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex pipiens mosquitoes were experimentally unable to transmit ZIKV either up to 21 days post an infectious blood meal or up to 14 days post intrathoracic inoculation. Infectious viral particles were detected in bodies, heads or saliva by a plaque forming unit assay on Vero cells. We therefore consider it unlikely that Culex mosquitoes are involved in the rapid spread of ZIKV.

AB  - To the Editor: Zika virus, genus Flavivirus, has spread nearly uncontrolled since its introduction into the Western Hemisphere; autochthonous spread has occurred in >39 countries and territories, including several US territories. Transmission of Zika virus is usually by the bite of infected mosquitoes, and potential for emergence in areas with competent mosquito vectors is high (1). Future spread of Zika virus is unpredictable; however, eventual local spread in the United States is possible. As of July 13, 2016, a total of 1,306 travel-associated cases had been reported (ArboNET, https://www.cdc.gov/zika); substantial populations of Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (Linnaeus) mosquitoes exist in >16 states in the eastern, southeastern, and southwestern United States; and Ae. (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) mosquitoes inhabit >28 states and continued expansion throughout the northern United States is probable (2). Mosquitoes of these 2 species have demonstrated the ability to transmit Zika virus (1).

TI  - Culex quinquefasciatus from Rio de Janeiro Is Not Competent to Transmit the Local Zika Virus
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 10
AB  - Background The Americas have suffered a dramatic epidemic of Zika since May in 2015, when Zika virus (ZIKV) was first detected in Brazil. Mosquitoes belonging to subgenus Stegomyia of Aedes, particularly Aedes aegypti, are considered the primary vectors of ZIKV. However, the rapid spread of the virus across the continent raised several concerns about the transmission dynamics, especially about potential mosquito vectors. The purpose of this work was to assess the vector competence of the house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus from an epidemic Zika area, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for local circulating ZIKV isolates. Methodology/Principal Findings Culex quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti (positive control of ZIKV infection) from Rio de Janeiro were orally exposed to two ZIKV strains isolated from human cases from Rio de Janeiro (Rio-U1 and Rio-S1). Fully engorged mosquitoes were held in incubators at 26 ± 1°C, 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle and 70 ± 10% humidity. For each combination mosquito population—ZIKV strain, 30 specimens were examined for infection, dissemination and transmission rates, at 7, 14 and 21 days after virus exposure by analyzing body (thorax plus abdomen), head and saliva respectively. Infection rates were minimal to completely absent in all Cx. quinquefasciatus-virus combinations and were significantly high for Ae. aegypti. Moreover, dissemination and transmission were not detected in any Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes whatever the incubation period and the ZIKV isolate. In contrast, Ae. aegypti ensured high viral dissemination and moderate to very high transmission. Conclusions/Significance The southern house mosquito Cx. quinquefasciatus from Rio de Janeiro was not competent to transmit local strains of ZIKV. Thus, there is no experimental evidence that Cx. quinquefasciatus likely plays a role in the ZIKV transmission. Consequently, at least in Rio, mosquito control to reduce ZIKV transmission should remain focused on Ae. aegypti.

EP  - 264
AB  - The rapid spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas raised many questions about the role of Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes in transmission, in addition to the key role played by the vector Aedes aegypti. Here we analysed the competence of Cx. quinquefasciatus (with or without Wolbachia endosymbionts) for a ZIKV isolate. We also examined the induction of RNA interference pathways after viral challenge and the production of small virus-derived RNAs. We did not observe any infection nor such small virus-derived RNAs, regardless of the presence or absence of Wolbachia. Thus, Cx. quinquefasciatus does not support ZIKV replication and Wolbachia is not involved in producing this phenotype. In short, these mosquitoes are very unlikely to play a role in transmission of ZIKV.

TI  - Current Understanding of the Role of T Cells in Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika Infections
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Arboviral infections such as Chikungunya (CHIKV), Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) are a major disease burden in tropical and sub-tropical countries, and there are no effective vaccinations or therapeutic drugs available at this time. Understanding the role of the T cell response is very important when designing effective vaccines. Currently, comprehensive identification of T cell epitopes during a DENV infection shows that CD8 and CD4 T cells and their specific phenotypes play protective and pathogenic roles. The protective role of CD8 T cells in DENV is carried out through the killing of infected cells and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, as CD4 T cells enhance B cell and CD8 T cell activities. A limited number of studies attempted to identify the involvement of T cells in CHIKV and ZIKV infection. The identification of human immunodominant ZIKV viral epitopes responsive to specific T cells is scarce, and none have been identified for CHIKV. In CHIKV infection, CD8 T cells are activated during the acute phase in the lymph nodes/blood, and CD4 T cells are activated during the chronic phase in the joints/muscles. Studies on the role of T cells in ZIKV-neuropathogenesis are limited and need to be explored. Many studies have shown the modulating actions of T cells due to cross-reactivity between DENV-ZIKV co-infections and have repeated heterologous/homologous DENV infection, which is an important factor to consider when developing an effective vaccine.

TI  - Cytoskeleton‐associated gelsolin responds to the midgut distention process in saline meal‐fed Aedes aegypti and affects arbovirus dissemination from the midgut
JF  - The FASEB Journal
VL  - 38
AB  - The mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is the principal vector for several arboviruses. The mosquito midgut is the initial tissue that gets infected with an arbovirus acquired along with a blood meal from a vertebrate host. Blood meal ingestion leads to midgut tissue distention thereby increasing the pore size of the surrounding basal lamina. This allows newly synthesized virions to exit the midgut by traversing the distended basal lamina to infect secondary tissues of the mosquito. We conducted a quantitative label‐free proteomic time course analysis with saline meal‐fed Ae. aegypti females to identify host factors involved in midgut tissue distention. Around 2000 proteins were detected during each of the seven sampling time points and 164 of those were uniquely expressed. Forty‐five of 97 differentially expressed proteins were upregulated during the 96‐h time course and most of those were involved in cytoskeleton modulation, metabolic activity, and vesicle/vacuole formation. The F‐actin‐modulating Ae. aegypti (Aa)‐gelsolin was selected for further functional studies. Stable knockout of Aa‐gelsolin resulted in a mosquito line, which showed distorted actin filaments in midgut‐associated tissues likely due to diminished F‐actin processing by gelsolin. Zika virus dissemination from the midgut of these mosquitoes was diminished and delayed. The loss of Aa‐gelsolin function was associated with an increased induction of apoptosis in midgut tissue indicating an involvement of Aa‐gelsolin in apoptotic signaling in mosquitoes. Here, we used proteomics to discover a novel host factor, Aa‐gelsolin, which affects the midgut escape barrier for arboviruses in mosquitoes and apoptotic signaling in the midgut.

TI  - Dapoxetine, a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, Suppresses Zika Virus Infection In Vitro
JF  - Molecules
VL  - 28
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, and is a pathogen posing a significant threat to human health. Currently, there is a lack of internationally approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of ZIKV infection, and symptomatic management remains the primary clinical approach. Consequently, the exploration of safe and effective anti-ZIKV drugs has emerged as a paramount imperative in ZIKV control efforts. In this study, we performed a screening of a compound library consisting of 1789 FDA-approved drugs to identify potential agents with anti-ZIKV activity. We have identified dapoxetine, an orally administered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly employed for the clinical management of premature ejaculation (PE), as a potential inhibitor of ZIKV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Consequently, we conducted surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis to validate the specific binding of dapoxetine to ZIKV RdRp, and further evaluated its inhibitory effect on ZIKV RdRp synthesis using the ZIKV Gluc reporter gene assay. Furthermore, we substantiated the efficacy of dapoxetine in suppressing intracellular replication of ZIKV, thereby demonstrating a concentration-dependent antiviral effect (EC50 values ranging from 4.20 μM to 12.6 μM) and negligible cytotoxicity (CC50 > 50 μM) across diverse cell lines. Moreover, cell fluorescence staining and Western blotting assays revealed that dapoxetine effectively reduced the expression of ZIKV proteins. Collectively, our findings suggest that dapoxetine exhibits anti-ZIKV effects by inhibiting ZIKV RdRp activity, positioning it as a potential candidate for clinical therapeutic intervention against ZIKV infection.

TI  - DDX50 Is a Viral Restriction Factor That Enhances IRF3 Activation
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - The transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB are crucial in innate immune signalling in response to many viral and bacterial pathogens. However, mechanisms leading to their activation remain incompletely understood. Viral RNA can be detected by RLR receptors, such as RIG-I and MDA5, and the dsRNA receptor TLR3. Alternatively, the DExD-Box RNA helicases DDX1-DDX21-DHX36 activate IRF3/NF-κB in a TRIF-dependent manner independent of RIG-I, MDA5, or TLR3. Here, we describe DDX50, which shares 55.6% amino acid identity with DDX21, as a non-redundant factor that promotes activation of the IRF3 signalling pathway following its stimulation with viral RNA or infection with RNA and DNA viruses. Deletion of DDX50 in mouse and human cells impaired IRF3 phosphorylation and IRF3-dependent endogenous gene expression and cytokine/chemokine production in response to cytoplasmic dsRNA (polyIC transfection), and infection by RNA and DNA viruses. Mechanistically, whilst DDX50 co-immunoprecipitated TRIF, it acted independently to the previously described TRIF-dependent RNA sensor DDX1. Indeed, shRNA-mediated depletion of DDX1 showed DDX1 was dispensable for signalling in response to RNA virus infection. Importantly, loss of DDX50 resulted in a significant increase in replication and dissemination of virus following infection with vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus, or Zika virus, highlighting its important role as a broad-ranging viral restriction factor.

TI  - De novo RNA synthesis catalyzed by the Zika Virus RNA polymerase domain
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Mosquito- and tick-borne pathogens including Chikungunya, Dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, Yellow fever and Zika virus, represent a new economic and public health challenge. In the absence of effective vaccines and specific therapies, only supportive regimens are administrated for most of these infections. Thus, the development of a targeted therapy is mandatory to stop the rapid progression of these pathogens and preoccupant associated burdens such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, microcephaly. For this, it is essential to develop biochemical tools to help study and target key viral enzymes involved in replication such as helicase complexes, methyl-transferases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Here, we show that a highly purified ZIKV polymerase domain is active in vitro. Importantly, we show that this isolated domain is capable of de novo synthesis of the viral genome and efficient elongation without terminal nucleotide transferase activity. Altogether, this isolated polymerase domain will be a precious tool to screen and optimize specific nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors to fight against Zika infections.

TI  - DEAD-Box Helicase DDX3X as a Host Target against Emerging Viruses: New Insights for Medicinal Chemical Approaches.
JF  - Journal of medicinal chemistry
AB  - In recent years, globalization, global warming, and population aging have contributed to the spread of emerging viruses, such as coronaviruses (COVs), West Nile (WNV), Dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIKV). The number of reported infections is increasing, and considering the high viral mutation rate, it is conceivable that it will increase significantly in the coming years. The risk caused by viruses is now more evident due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the need to find new broad-spectrum antiviral agents able to tackle the present pandemic and future epidemics. DDX3X helicase is a host factor required for viral replication. Selective inhibitors have been identified and developed into broad-spectrum antivirals active against emerging pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 and most importantly against drug-resistant strains. This perspective describes the inhibitors identified in the last years, highlighting their therapeutic potential as innovative broad-spectrum antivirals.

TI  - Deciphering the Role of Extracellular Vesicles Derived from ZIKV-Infected hcMEC/D3 Cells on the Blood–Brain Barrier System
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - To date, no vaccines or antivirals are available against Zika virus (ZIKV). In addition, the mechanisms underlying ZIKV-associated pathogenesis of the central nervous system (CNS) are largely unexplored. Getting more insight into the cellular pathways that ZIKV recruits to facilitate infection of susceptible cells will be crucial for establishing an effective treatment strategy. In general, cells secrete a number of vesicles, known as extracellular vesicles (EVs), in response to viral infections. These EVs serve as intercellular communicators. Here, we investigated the role of EVs derived from ZIKV-infected human brain microvascular endothelial cells on the blood–brain barrier (BBB) system. We demonstrated that ZIKV-infected EVs (IEVs) can incorporate viral components, including ZIKV RNA, NS1, and E-protein, and further transfer them to several types of CNS cells. Using label-free impedance-based biosensing, we observed that ZIKV and IEVs can temporally disturb the monolayer integrity of BBB-mimicking cells, possibly by inducing structural rearrangements of the adherent protein VE-cadherin (immunofluorescence staining). Finally, differences in the lipidomic profile between EVs and their parental cells possibly suggest a preferential sorting mechanism of specific lipid species into the vesicles. To conclude, these data suggest that IEVs could be postulated as vehicles (Trojan horse) for ZIKV transmission via the BBB.

TI  - Decreased CSTB, RAGE, and Axl Receptor Are Associated with Zika Infection in the Human Placenta
JF  - Cells
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) compromises placental integrity, infecting the fetus. However, the mechanisms associated with ZIKV penetration into the placenta leading to fetal infection are unknown. Cystatin B (CSTB), the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO (AXL) have been implicated in ZIKV infection and inflammation. This work investigates CSTB, RAGE, and AXL receptor expression and activation pathways in ZIKV-infected placental tissues at term. The hypothesis is that there is overexpression of CSTB and increased inflammation affecting RAGE and AXL receptor expression in ZIKV-infected placentas. Pathological analyses of 22 placentas were performed to determine changes caused by ZIKV infection. Quantitative proteomics, immunofluorescence, and western blot were performed to analyze proteins and pathways affected by ZIKV infection in frozen placentas. The pathological analysis confirmed decreased size of capillaries, hyperplasia of Hofbauer cells, disruption in the trophoblast layer, cell agglutination, and ZIKV localization to the trophoblast layer. In addition, there was a significant decrease in CSTB, RAGE, and AXL expression and upregulation of caspase 1, tubulin beta, and heat shock protein 27. Modulation of these proteins and activation of inflammasome and pyroptosis pathways suggest targets for modulation of ZIKV infection in the placenta.

TI  - Delving into Zika virus structural dynamics – a closer look at NS3 helicase loop flexibility and its role in drug discovery
JF  - RSC Advances
VL  - 7
SP  - 22133
EP  - 22144
AB  - The Zika virus has emerged as a pathogen of major health concern. The rapid spread of the virus has led to uproar in the medical domain as scientists frantically race to develop effective vaccines and small molecules to inhibit the virus. In the past year, there has been a flood of Zika knowledge published including its characteristics, transmission routes and its role in disease conditions such as microcephaly and Gullian–Barŕe syndrome. Targeted therapy against specific viral maturation proteins is necessary in halting the replication of the virus in the human host, thus decreasing host–host transmission. This prompted us to investigate the structural properties of the Zika NS3 helicase when bound to ATP-competitive inhibitor, NITD008. In this study, comparative molecular dynamic simulations were employed for APO and bound protein to demonstrate the molecular mechanism of the helicase. Results clearly revealed that NITD008-binding caused significant residue fluctuations at the P-loop compared to the rigid nature of the APO conformation. The NITD008-helicase complex also revealed residues 339–348 to transition from a 310-helix to a stable α-helix. These protein fluctuations were verified by investigation of dynamic cross correlation and principal component analysis. The fundamental dynamic analysis presented in this report is crucial in understanding Zika NS3 helicase function, thereby giving insights toward an inhibition mechanism. The information reported on the binding mode at the ATPase active site may also assist in designing effective inhibitors against this detrimental viral target.

TI  - Dengue and Zika RNA-RNA interactomes reveal pro- and anti-viral RNA in human cells
JF  - Genome Biology
VL  - 24
AB  - Background Identifying host factors is key to understanding RNA virus pathogenicity. Besides proteins, RNAs can interact with virus genomes to impact replication. Results Here, we use proximity ligation sequencing to identify virus-host RNA interactions for four strains of Zika virus (ZIKV) and one strain of dengue virus (DENV-1) in human cells. We find hundreds of coding and non-coding RNAs that bind to DENV and ZIKV viruses. Host RNAs tend to bind to single-stranded regions along the virus genomes according to hybridization energetics. Compared to SARS-CoV-2 interactors, ZIKV-interacting host RNAs tend to be downregulated upon virus infection. Knockdown of several short non-coding RNAs, including miR19a-3p, and 7SK RNA results in a decrease in viral replication, suggesting that they act as virus-permissive factors. In addition, the 3′UTR of DYNLT1 mRNA acts as a virus-restrictive factor by binding to the conserved dumbbell region on DENV and ZIKV 3′UTR to decrease virus replication. We also identify a conserved set of host RNAs that interacts with DENV, ZIKV, and SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that these RNAs are broadly important for RNA virus infection. Conclusions This study demonstrates that host RNAs can impact virus replication in permissive and restrictive ways, expanding our understanding of host factors and RNA-based gene regulation during viral pathogenesis.

TI  - Dengue and Zika Virus 5′ Untranslated Regions Harbor Internal Ribosomal Entry Site Functions
JF  - mBio
VL  - 10
AB  - Members of the genus Flavivirus of Flaviviridae are important human pathogens of great concern because they cause serious diseases, sometimes death, in human populations living in tropical, subtropical (dengue virus [DENV], Zika virus [ZIKV], and yellow fever virus), or moderate climates (West Nile virus). Flaviviruses are known to control their translation by a cap-dependent mechanism. We have observed, however, that the uncapped genomes of DENV or ZIKV can initiate infection of mammalian and insect cells. We provide evidence that the short 5′ untranslated region (5′-UTR) of DENV or ZIKV genomes can fulfill the function of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). This strategy frees these organisms from the cap-dependent mechanism of gene expression at an as yet unknown stage of proliferation. The data raise new questions about the biology and evolution of flaviviruses, possibly leading to new controls of flavivirus disease. ABSTRACT The Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family encompasses numerous enveloped plus-strand RNA viruses. Dengue virus (DENV), a flavivirus, is the leading cause of serious arthropod-borne disease globally. The genomes of DENV, like the genomes of yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile fever virus (WNV), or Zika virus (ZIKV), control their translation by a 5′-terminal capping group. Three other genera of Flaviviridae are remarkable because their viruses use internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) to control translation, and they are not arthropod transmitted. In 2006, E. Harris’ group published work suggesting that DENV RNA does not stringently need a cap for translation. They proposed that instead DENV translation is controlled by an interplay between 5′ and 3′ termini. Here we present evidence that the DENV or ZIKV 5′ untranslated regions (5′-UTRs) alone have IRES competence. This conclusion is based, first, on the observation that uncapped monocistronic mRNAs 5′ terminated with the DENV or ZIKV 5′-UTRs can efficiently direct translation of a reporter gene in BHK and C6/36 cells and second, that either 5′-UTR placed between two reporter genes can efficiently induce expression of the downstream gene in BHK cells but not in C6/36 cells. These experiments followed observations that uncapped DENV/ZIKV genomic transcripts, 5′ terminated with pppAN… or GpppAN…, can initiate infections of mammalian (BHK) or mosquito (C6/36) cells. IRES competence of the 5′-UTRs of DENV/ZIKV raises many open questions regarding the biology and control, as well as the evolution, of insect-borne flaviviruses. IMPORTANCE Members of the genus Flavivirus of Flaviviridae are important human pathogens of great concern because they cause serious diseases, sometimes death, in human populations living in tropical, subtropical (dengue virus [DENV], Zika virus [ZIKV], and yellow fever virus), or moderate climates (West Nile virus).

TI  - Dengue and Zika Virus Capsid Proteins Contain a Common PEX19-Binding Motif
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to suppress the host immune system. For instance, flavivirus infections were found to sabotage peroxisomes, organelles with an important role in innate immunity. The current model suggests that the capsid (C) proteins of DENV and ZIKV downregulate peroxisomes, ultimately resulting in reduced production of interferons by interacting with the host protein PEX19, a crucial chaperone in peroxisomal biogenesis. Here, we aimed to explore the importance of peroxisomes and the role of C interaction with PEX19 in the flavivirus life cycle. By infecting cells lacking peroxisomes we show that this organelle is required for optimal DENV replication. Moreover, we demonstrate that DENV and ZIKV C bind PEX19 through a conserved PEX19-binding motif, which is also commonly found in cellular peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs). However, in contrast to PMPs, this interaction does not result in the targeting of C to peroxisomes. Furthermore, we show that the presence of C results in peroxisome loss due to impaired peroxisomal biogenesis, which appears to occur by a PEX19-independent mechanism. Hence, these findings challenge the current model of how flavivirus C might downregulate peroxisomal abundance and suggest a yet unknown role of peroxisomes in flavivirus biology.

TI  - Dengue and Zika virus NS4B proteins differ in topology and in determinants of ER membrane protein complex dependency
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 99
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses utilize the cellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for all aspects of their lifecycle. Genome replication and other viral activities take place in structures called replication organelles (ROs), which are invaginations induced in the ER membrane. Among the required elements for RO formation is the biogenesis of viral nonstructural proteins NS4A and NS4B. We have previously shown that NS4A and NS4B from Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) depend on the cellular ER membrane protein complex (EMC) for biogenesis. Here, we find that this dependency extends to the NS4A and NS4B proteins of Yellow Fever virus (YFV) and West Nile virus (WNV), which share similar computationally predicted membrane topologies. However, we demonstrate that ZIKV NS4B has different determinants of its dependency on the EMC than those for DENV NS4B, as well as a different membrane topology. Furthermore, we characterize mutant isolates of DENV and ZIKV that were serially passaged in EMC knockout cells and find that none are completely independent of the EMC for infection, and that mutant NS4B proteins remain sensitive to EMC depletion, suggesting a high genetic barrier to EMC depletion. Collectively, our findings are consistent with a model in which the EMC recognizes multiple determinants in the NS4B protein to support infection in several flaviviruses of critical public health importance. IMPORTANCE The NS4A and NS4B proteins of flaviviruses are critically important to replication, but little is known about their function. It has been previously reported that the cellular EMC supports the biogenesis of NS4A and NS4B from Dengue and Zika virus. In this work, we demonstrate that this dependency on the EMC for NS4A and NS4B biogenesis extends to the West Nile and Yellow Fever viruses. Furthermore, we examine the features of ZIKV NS4B and find that its membrane topology of ZIKV NS4B and its determinants of dependency on the EMC are different from those previously described in DENV NS4B. Finally, we present evidence that there is a high genetic barrier for Dengue and Zika viruses to overcome EMC depletion.

TI  - Dengue Virus-2 Infection Affects Fecundity and Elicits Specific Transcriptional Changes in the Ovaries of Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue fever (DF), caused by the dengue virus (DENV), is the most burdensome arboviral disease in the world, with an estimated 400 million infections each year. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the main vector of DENV and transmits several other human pathogens, including Zika, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses. Previous studies have shown that the pathogen infection of mosquitoes can alter reproductive fitness, revealing specific vector-pathogen interactions that are key determinants of vector competence. However, only a handful of studies have examined the effect of DENV infection in A. aegypti, showing a reduction in lifespan and fecundity over multiple blood meals. To provide a more comprehensive analysis of the impact of DENV infection on egg laying and fecundity, we assessed egg laying timing in DENV-2 blood-fed mosquitoes (infected group) compared to mock blood-fed mosquitoes (control group). We confirmed a significant decrease in fecundity during the first gonadotrophic cycle. To further investigate this phenotype and the underlying DENV-2 infection-dependent changes in gene expression, we conducted a transcriptomic analysis for differentially expressed genes in the ovaries of A. aegypti infected with DENV-2 vs. mock-infected mosquitoes. This analysis reveals several DENV-2-regulated genes; among them, we identified a group of 12 metabolic genes that we validated using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Interestingly, two genes found to be upregulated in DENV-infected mosquito ovaries exhibited an antiviral role for DENV-2 in an Aedes cell line. Altogether, this study offers useful insights into the virus-vector interface, highlighting the importance of gene expression changes in the mosquito’s ovary during DENV-2 infection in the first gonadotrophic  cycle,  triggering  antiviral  responses  that  may  possibly  interfere  with mosquito reproduction. This information is extremely relevant for further investigation of A. aegypti’s ability to tolerate viruses since virally infected mosquitoes in nature constitute a powerful source of supporting viruses during intra-epidemic periods, causing a huge burden on the public health system. Graphical Abstract Aedes aegypti first gonadotrophic cycle is altered by DENV-2 infection.

TI  - DENV2 and ZIKV modulate the feeding behavior of Aedes aegypti by altering the tyrosine-dopamine pathway
JF  - mBio
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses are known for their neurotropic properties and their long-lasting neurological effects. As mosquito-borne viruses, they can persistently infect the central nervous system of mosquitoes without causing symptoms, yet they can alter the physiology and behavior of these insects. However, the molecular mechanisms by which flaviviruses directly influence mosquito feeding behavior remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) and Zika virus (ZIKV) elevate mosquito locomotor activity and blood-feeding propensity throughout the day. Untargeted metabolomics identified increased N-acetyl-L-tyrosine levels in virus-infected mosquito heads, which enhanced locomotor activity and blood-feeding efficiency when injected into Aedes aegypti. Virus infection disrupted the circadian rhythm of tyrosine hydroxylase (Aath), a key dopamine synthesis gene, maintaining its consistent elevation of expression throughout the day. Furthermore, DENV2 and ZIKV perturbed the molecular circadian core oscillator in Ae. aegypti. Additionally, mosquitoes injected with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine exhibited higher locomotor activity and blood-sucking rates. In contrast, knockdown of Aath reduced blood feeding and decreased infection rates in mice bitten by virus-infected mosquitoes. Collectively, our findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which DENV2 and ZIKV modulate the physiology and feeding behavior of Ae. aegypti vectors, thereby facilitating the transmission of these viruses. IMPORTANCE This study sheds light on how DENV2 and ZIKV affect the feeding behavior of mosquitoes. We discovered the molecular mechanisms that lead to increased movement and blood feeding in mosquitoes by altering neurotransmitter levels and disrupting their internal biological clocks. These findings reveal how these viruses enhance their own transmission by making mosquitoes more active. This research could help in developing strategies to target these processes, ultimately aiding efforts to control the spread of dengue and Zika viruses and reducing the risk of outbreaks.

TI  - Determination of system level alterations in host transcriptome due to Zika virus (ZIKV) Infection in retinal pigment epithelium
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 8
AB  - Previously, we reported that Zika virus (ZIKV) causes ocular complications such as chorioretinal atrophy, by infecting cells lining the blood-retinal barrier, including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). To understand the molecular basis of ZIKV-induced retinal pathology, we performed a meta-analysis of transcriptome profiles of ZIKV-infected human primary RPE and other cell types infected with either ZIKV or other related flaviviruses (Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, and Dengue). This led to identification of a unique ZIKV infection signature comprising 43 genes (35 upregulated and 8 downregulated). The major biological processes perturbed include SH3/SH2 adaptor activity, lipid and ceramide metabolism, and embryonic organ development. Further, a comparative analysis of some differentially regulated genes (ABCG1, SH2B3, SIX4, and TNFSF13B) revealed that ZIKV induced their expression relatively more than dengue virus did in RPE. Importantly, the pharmacological inhibition of ABCG1, a membrane transporter of cholesterol, resulted in reduced ZIKV infectivity. Interestingly, the ZIKV infection signature revealed the downregulation of ALDH5A1 and CHML, genes implicated in neurological (cognitive impairment, expressive language deficit, and mild ataxia) and ophthalmic (choroideremia) disorders, respectively. Collectively, our study revealed that ZIKV induces differential gene expression in RPE cells, and the identified genes/pathways (e.g., ABCG1) could potentially contribute to ZIKV-associated ocular pathologies.

TI  - Determination of the Cell Permissiveness Spectrum, Mode of RNA Replication, and RNA-Protein Interaction of Zika Virus
JF  - BMC Infectious Diseases
VL  - 17
AB  - BackgroundTwo lineages of Zika virus (ZIKV) have been classified according to the phylogenetic analysis: African and Asian lineages. It is unclear whether differences exist between the two strains in host cell permissiveness, this information is important for understanding viral pathogenesis and designing anti-viral strategies.MethodsIn the present study, we comparatively studied the permissive spectrum of human cells for both the African (MR766) and Asian strains (PRVABC59) using an RNA in situ hybridization (RISH) to visualize RNA replication, an immunofluorescence technology, and a western blot assay to determine viral protein production, and a real-time RT-PCR to examine viral RNA multiplication level. The experiments were undertaken in the condition of cell culture.ResultsWe identified several human cell lines, including fibroblast, epithelial cells, brain cells, stem cells, and blood cells that are susceptible for the infection of both Asian and African strains. We did not find any differences between the MR766 and the PRVABC59 in the permissiveness, infection rate, and replication modes. Inconsistent to a previous report (Hamel et al. JVI 89:8880–8896, 2015), using RISH or real-time RT-PCR, we found that human foreskin fibroblast cells were not permissive for ZIKV infection. Instead, human lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5) were fully permissive for ZIKV infection. Surprisingly, a direct interaction of ZIKV RNA with envelop (E) protein (a structure protein) was demonstrated by an RNA chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Three binding sites were identified in the ZIKV RNA genome for the interaction with the E protein.ConclusionOur results imply that the E protein may be important for viral RNA replication, and provide not only the information of ZIKV permissiveness that guides the usage of human cells for the ZIKV studies, but also the insight into the viral RNA-E protein interaction that may be targeted for intervention by designing small molecule drugs.

TI  - Development and characterization of an inducible assay system to measure Zika virus capsid interactions
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 94
SP  - 5392
EP  - 5400
AB  - The global spread of the mosquito‐borne Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and its complications including Guillain‐Barré syndrome and fetus microcephaly in 2015 have made ZIKV as a significant public health threat. The capsid protein plays crucial roles in ZIKV replication and thus represents an attractive therapeutic target. However, inhibitors of ZIKV capsid assembly have not been rigorously identified due to the lack of a target‐based screening system. In this study, we developed a novel ZIKV capsid interaction method based on a split‐luciferase complementation assay, which can be used to measure and quantify ZIKV capsid–capsid (C–C) interaction by the restored luciferase signal when capsid proteins interact with each other. Furthermore, a Tet‐on inducible stable cell line was generated to screen inhibitors of capsid dimerization. By using of this system, peptides (Pep.15‐24 in the N‐terminal region of ZIKV capsid protein and Pep.44‐58 in the α2 helix of ZIKV capsid protein) were identified to inhibit ZIKV C–C interaction. Overall, this study developed a novel inducible assay system to measure ZIKV capsid interaction and identify ZIKV capsid multimerization inhibitors, which will be applied for future discovery of ZIKV assembly inhibitors.

TI  - Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2, a Novel Target of Flavivirus NS2B3 Protease, Promotes Zika Virus Replication by Regulating Lipid Droplet Formation
JF  - Research
VL  - 7
AB  - Various lipid metabolism-related factors are essential for Zika virus (ZIKV) replication. In this study, we revealed a crucial role of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) in ZIKV replication using a short hairpin RNA-based gene knockdown technique. The replication of ZIKV was significantly inhibited by DGAT2 depletion in multiple cell lines and restored by trans-complementation with DGAT2. Mechanistically, DGAT2 is recruited in the viral replication complex by interacting with non-structural (NS) proteins. Among them, both human and murine DGAT2s can be cleaved by NS2B3 at the 122R-R-S124 site. Interestingly, the cleavage product of DGAT2 becomes more stable and is sufficient to promote the lipid droplet (LD) formation independent of its enzymatic activity. This work identifies DGAT2 as a novel target of the viral protease NS2B3 and elucidates that DGAT2 is recruited by viral proteins into the replication complex, thereby playing a proviral role by promoting LD formation, which advances our understanding of host–flavivirus interaction.

EP  - 3072
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks pose a massive public health threat in several countries. We have developed an in vivo model to investigate the host–ZIKV interaction in Drosophila. We have found that a strain of ZIKV replicates in wild-type flies without reducing their survival ability. We have shown that ZIKV infection triggers RNA interference and that mutating Dicer-2 results in enhanced ZIKV load and increased susceptibility to ZIKV infection. Using a flavivirus-specific Ab, we have found that ZIKV is localized in the gut and fat body cells of the infected wild-type flies and results in their perturbed homeostasis. In addition, Dicer-2 mutants display severely reduced insulin activity, which could contribute toward the increased mortality of these flies. Our work establishes the suitability of Drosophila as the model system to study host–ZIKV dynamics, which is expected to greatly advance our understanding of the molecular and physiological processes that determine the outcome of this disease.

TI  - Different footprints of the Zika and dengue surface proteins on viral membranes.
JF  - Soft matter
VL  - 14 27
SP  - 5615
EP  - 5621
AB  - The flavivirus Zika virus (ZV) became an international emergency within two years of its outbreak in the Americas. Dengue virus (DENV), which is also a flavivirus, causes significant clinical harm in equatorial regions. A common feature amongst flaviviruses like ZV and DENV is an icosahedral shell of exactly 180 copies of the envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins anchored in a lipid membrane, which engulfs the viral RNA and capsid proteins. Host recognition by both ZV and DENV is linked to the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids in the viral lipidome. Glycosylation of Asn residues on the Zika E protein may be linked to ZV induced neuropathies. We carry out coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations of the E3M3 hexamer embedded in the ZV and DENV lipidomes, and we show that the proteins have a significantly different lipid footprint in the viral lipidome. PE lipids in DENV and PS lipids in ZV enrich near the protein hexamer. We attribute the difference to a higher number of cationic amino acids in the ZV M protein. We also show that the three glycosylation sites on ZV, but not on DENV, are conformationally variant. Our data shed new light on the lipid interactions, and thus the host recognition mechanisms of the two viruses, which may be molecular determinants of the neuropathies caused by the ZV.

TI  - Differential and convergent utilization of autophagy components by positive-strand RNA viruses
JF  - PLoS Biology
VL  - 17
AB  - Many viruses interface with the autophagy pathway, a highly conserved process for recycling cellular components. For three viral infections in which autophagy constituents are proviral (poliovirus, dengue, and Zika), we developed a panel of knockouts (KOs) of autophagy-related genes to test which components of the canonical pathway are utilized. We discovered that each virus uses a distinct set of initiation components; however, all three viruses utilize autophagy-related gene 9 (ATG9), a lipid scavenging protein, and LC3 (light-chain 3), which is involved in membrane curvature. These results show that viruses use noncanonical routes for membrane sculpting and LC3 recruitment. By measuring viral RNA abundance, we also found that poliovirus utilizes these autophagy components for intracellular growth, while dengue and Zika virus only use autophagy components for post-RNA replication processes. Comparing how RNA viruses manipulate the autophagy pathway reveals new noncanonical autophagy routes, explains the exacerbation of disease by starvation, and uncovers common targets for antiviral drugs.

TI  - Differential cell line susceptibility to the emerging Zika virus: implications for disease pathogenesis, non-vector-borne human transmission and animal reservoirs
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 5
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is unique among human-pathogenic flaviviruses by its association with congenital anomalies and trans-placental and sexual human-to-human transmission. Although the pathogenesis of ZIKV-associated neurological complications has been reported in recent studies, key questions on the pathogenesis of the other clinical manifestations, non-vector-borne transmission and potential animal reservoirs of ZIKV remain unanswered. We systematically characterized the differential cell line susceptibility of 18 human and 15 nonhuman cell lines to two ZIKV isolates (human and primate) and dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). Productive ZIKV replication (⩾2 log increase in viral load, ZIKV nonstructural protein-1 (NS1) protein expression and cytopathic effects (CPE)) was found in the placental (JEG-3), neuronal (SF268), muscle (RD), retinal (ARPE19), pulmonary (Hep-2 and HFL), colonic (Caco-2),and hepatic (Huh-7) cell lines. These findings helped to explain the trans-placental transmission and other clinical manifestations of ZIKV. Notably, the prostatic (LNCaP), testicular (833KE) and renal (HEK) cell lines showed increased ZIKV load and/or NS1 protein expression without inducing CPE, suggesting their potential roles in sexual transmission with persistent viral replication at these anatomical sites. Comparatively, none of the placental and genital tract cell lines allowed efficient DENV-2 replication. Among the nonhuman cell lines, nonhuman primate (Vero and LLC-MK2), pig (PK-15), rabbit (RK-13), hamster (BHK21) and chicken (DF-1) cell lines supported productive ZIKV replication. These animal species may be important reservoirs and/or potential animal models for ZIKV. The findings in our study help to explain the viral shedding pattern, transmission and pathogenesis of the rapidly disseminating ZIKV, and are useful for optimizing laboratory diagnostics and studies on the pathogenesis and counter-measures of ZIKV.

TI  - Differential frequencies of HLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 alleles and haplotypes are observed in the arbovirus-related neurological syndromes.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
AB  - BACKGROUND
We took advantage of the 2015-2016 Brazilian arbovirus outbreak (ZIKV/DENV/CHIKV), associated with neurological complications, to type HLA-DRB1/DQA1/DQB1 variants in patients exhibiting neurological complications and in bone marrow donors from the same endemic geographical region.


METHODS
. DRB1/DQA1/DQB1 loci were typed using sequence-specific oligonucleotides. In silico studies were performed using X-ray resolved dimer constructions.


RESULTS
The DQA1*01, DQA1*05, DQB1*02 or DQB1*06 genotypes/haplotypes and DQA1/DQB1 haplotypes that encode the putative DQA1/DQB1 dimers were overrepresented in the whole group of patients and in patients exhibiting peripheral neurological spectrum disorders (PSD) or encephalitis spectrum disorders (ESD). The DRB1*04, DRB1*13 and DQA1*03 allele groups protected against arbovirus neurological manifestation, being underrepresented in whole group of patients and/or ESD, PSD groups. Genetic and in silico studies revealed that DQA1/DQB1 dimers: i) were primarily associated with susceptibility to arbovirus infections, ii) can bind to a broad range of ZIKV peptides (235 out of a library of 1,878 peptides, stressing prM and NS2A), and iii) exhibited hydrophilic and highly positively charged grooves when compared to the DRA1/DRB1 cleft. The protective dimer (DRA1/DRB1*04) bound a limited number of ZIKV peptides (40 out of 1,878 peptides, primarily prM).


CONCLUSION
Protective haplotypes may recognize arbovirus peptides more specifically than susceptible haplotypes.

TI  - Differentiation of Long Non-Coding RNA and mRNA Expression Profiles in Male and Female Aedes albopictus
JF  - Frontiers in Genetics
VL  - 10
AB  - The Asia tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is an important vector of arboviruses, and females can transmit pathogens such as the dengue, zika, and chikungunya viruses. Understanding sex-related differences in this mosquito is fundamental for vector control. However, there are no reports of systematic characterization of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in male and female Ae. albopictus. To investigate the roles of coding and non-coding RNAs in both sexes of Ae. albopictus, RNA sequencing was performed on male and female samples. The results showed 305 differentially expressed protein-coding genes (DEGs) between males and females, of which 198 were highly expressed in males and 125 were highly expressed in females. Sex-associated gene ontology terms were enriched. Analysis with the FEELnc software identified 2,623 novel lncRNAs, of which 26 showed male high expression and 11 showed female high expression. Quantitative real-time PCR of randomly selected DEGs and lncRNAs supported the validity of the RNA sequencing results. Knocking down male high-expressed gene AALF000433 in male adults reduced the egg hatching rate. This study provides valuable data on sex-specific expression of protein-coding genes and lncRNAs in adult Ae. albopictus, which will guide further studies aimed at understanding sex development and determination mechanisms in this species.

TI  - Direct Activation of Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) by PF-06409577 Inhibits Flavivirus Infection through Modification of Host Cell Lipid Metabolism
JF  - Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy
VL  - 62
AB  - ABSTRACT Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are a group of RNA viruses that constitute global threats for human and animal health. Replication of these pathogens is strictly dependent on cellular lipid metabolism. We have evaluated the effect of the pharmacological activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of lipid metabolism, on the infection of three medically relevant flaviviruses, namely, West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and dengue virus (DENV). WNV is responsible for recurrent outbreaks of meningitis and encephalitis, affecting humans and horses worldwide. ZIKV has caused a recent pandemic associated with birth defects (microcephaly), reproductive disorders, and severe neurological complications (Guillain-Barré syndrome). DENV is the etiological agent of the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease, which can induce a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue. Our results showed, for the first time, that activation of AMPK using the specific small molecule activator PF-06409577 reduced WNV, ZIKV, and DENV infection. This antiviral effect was associated with an impairment of viral replication due to the modulation of host cell lipid metabolism exerted by the compound. These results support that the pharmacological activation of AMPK, which currently constitutes an important pharmacological target for human diseases, could also provide a feasible approach for broad-spectrum host-directed antiviral discovery.

TI  - Directional entry and release of Zika virus from polarized epithelial cells
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 16
AB  - Both vector borne and sexual transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) involve infection of epithelial cells in the initial stages of infection. Epithelial cells are unique in their ability to form polarized monolayers and their barrier function. Cell polarity induces an asymmetry in the epithelial monolayer, which is maintained by tight junctions and specialized sorting machinery. This differential localization can have a potential impact of virus infection. Asymmetrical distribution of a viral receptor can restrict virus entry to a particular membrane while polarized sorting can lead to a directional release of virions. The present study examined the impact of cell polarity on ZIKV infection and release. A polarized Caco-2 cell model we described previously was used to assess ZIKV infection. Transepithelial resistance (TEER) was used to assess epithelial cell polarity, and virus infection was measured by immunofluorescence microscopy and qRT-PCR. Cell permeability was measured using a fluorescein leakage assay. Statistical significance was calculated using one-way ANOVA and significance was set at p < 0.05. Using the Caco-2 cell model for polarized epithelial cells, we report that Zika virus preferentially infects polarized cells from the apical route and is released vectorially through the basolateral route. Our data also indicates that release occurs without disruption of cell permeability. Our results show that ZIKV has directional infection and egress in a polarized cell system. This mechanism of directional infection may be one of the mechanisms that enables the cross the epithelial barrier effectively without a disruption in cell monolayer integrity. Elucidation of entry and release characteristics of Zika virus in polarized epithelial cells can lead to better understanding of virus dissemination in the host, and can help in developing effective therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Directional translocation resistance of Zika xrRNA
JF  - Nature Communications

AB  - xrRNAs from flaviviruses survive in host cells because of their exceptional dichotomic response to the unfolding action of different enzymes. They can be unwound, and hence copied, by replicases, and yet can resist degradation by exonucleases. How the same stretch of xrRNA can encode such diverse responses is an open question.

TI  - Disruption of myelin structure and oligodendrocyte maturation in a macaque model of congenital Zika infection
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 15
AB  - Zika virus (ZikV) infection during pregnancy can cause congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and neurodevelopmental delay in infants, of which the pathogenesis remains poorly understood. We utilize an established female pigtail macaque maternal-to-fetal ZikV infection/exposure model to study fetal brain pathophysiology of CZS manifesting from ZikV exposure in utero. We find prenatal ZikV exposure leads to profound disruption of fetal myelin, with extensive downregulation in gene expression for key components of oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin production. Immunohistochemical analyses reveal marked decreases in myelin basic protein intensity and myelinated fiber density in ZikV-exposed animals. At the ultrastructural level, the myelin sheath in ZikV-exposed animals shows multi-focal decompaction, occurring concomitant with dysregulation of oligodendrocyte gene expression and maturation. These findings define fetal neuropathological profiles of ZikV-linked brain injury underlying CZS resulting from ZikV exposure in utero. Because myelin is critical for cortical development, ZikV-related perturbations in oligodendrocyte function may have long-term consequences on childhood neurodevelopment, even in the absence of overt microcephaly.

TI  - Disruption of Zika Virus xrRNA1-Dependent sfRNA1 Production Results in Tissue-Specific Attenuated Viral Replication
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), like other flaviviruses, produces several species of sub-genomic RNAs (sfRNAs) during infection, corresponding to noncoding RNA fragments of different lengths derived from the viral 3’ untranslated region (UTR). Over the course of infection, these sfRNAs accumulate in the cell as a result of incomplete viral genome degradation of the 3’UTR by host 5’ to 3’ exoribonuclease (Xrn1). The halting of Xrn1 in the 3’UTR is due to two RNA pseudoknot structures in the 3’UTR termed exoribonuclease-resistant RNA1 and 2 (xrRNA1&2). Studies with related flaviviruses have shown that sfRNAs are important for pathogenicity and inhibiting both mosquito and mammalian host defense mechanisms. However, these investigations have not included ZIKV and there is very limited data addressing how sfRNAs impact infection in a whole animal model or specific tissues. In this study, we rescued a sfRNA1-deficient ZIKV (X1) by targeted mutation in the xrRNA1 3’ UTR structure. We found that virus which lacks the production of the largest ZIKV sfRNA species, sfRNA1. Using the X1 virus to infect adult IFNAR1-/- mice, we found that while the lack of sfRNA1 does not alter ZIKV replication in the spleen, there is a significant reduction of ZIKV genome replication in the brain and placenta compared to WT ZIKV infection. Despite thee attenuated phenotype of the X1 ZIKV, mice develop a robust neutralizing antibody response. We conclude that targeted disruption of xrRNA1 results in tissue-specific attenuation while still supporting robust neutralizing antibody responses. Future studies will need to investigate the tissue-specific mechanisms by which ZIKV sfRNAs influence infection and may utilize targeted xrRNA mutations to develop novel attenuated flavivirus vaccine approaches.

TI  - Disulfide reduction allosterically destabilizes the β-ladder sub-domain assembly within the NS1 dimer of ZIKV
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) was responsible for a recent debilitating epidemic that till date has no cure. A potential way to reduce ZIKV virulence is to limit the action of the non-structural proteins involved in its viral replication. One such protein, NS1, encoded as a monomer by the viral genome, plays a major role via symmetric oligomerization. We examine the homodimeric structure of the dominant β-ladder segment of NS1 with extensive all atom molecular dynamics. We find it stably bounded by two spatially separated interaction clusters (C1 and C2) with significant differences in the nature of their interactions. Four pairs of distal, intra-monomeric disulfide bonds are found to be coupled to the stability, local structure, and wettability of the interfacial region. Symmetric reduction of the intra-monomeric disulfides triggers marked dynamical heterogeneity, interfacial wettability and asymmetric salt bridging propensity. Harnessing the model-free Lipari-Szabo based formalism for estimation of conformational entropy (Sconf), we find clear signatures of heterogeneity in the monomeric conformational entropies. The observed asymmetry, very small in the unperturbed state, expands significantly in the reduced states. This allosteric effect is most noticeable in the electrostatically bound C2 cluster that underlies the greatest stability in the unperturbed state. Allosteric induction of conformational and thermodynamic asymmetry is expected to affect the pathways leading to symmetric higher ordered oligomerization, and thereby affect crucial replication pathways. Statement of significance Controlling viral pathogenesis remains a challenge in the face of modern-day epidemics. Though cumbersome and fraught with misleads, most therapeutic endeavors lean towards the design of drug molecules targeting specific proteins involved in viral pathogenesis. This work demonstrates an alternative approach, namely the usage of allosteric intervention to disrupt the binding integrity of the primary domain of the non-structural NS1 protein dimer crucially important in ZIKV virulence. The intervention, triggered by symmetric reduction of the internal monomeric disulfide bonds, results in weakening and distortion of the distal binding interfaces. It further introduces marked structural and entropic asymmetry within the homooligomeric unit, precluding the formation of higher ordered oligomers of high symmetry. The results have important ramifications for consolidated efforts at limiting ZIKV virulence.

TI  - DNA-PKcs restricts Zika virus spreading and is required for effective antiviral response
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a single-strand RNA mosquito-borne flavivirus with significant public health impact. ZIKV infection induces double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) in human neural progenitor cells that may contribute to severe neuronal manifestations in newborns. The DNA-PK complex plays a critical role in repairing DSBs and in the innate immune response to infection. It is unknown, however, whether DNA-PK regulates ZIKV infection. Here we investigated the role of DNA-PKcs, the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK, during ZIKV infection. We demonstrate that DNA-PKcs restricts the spread of ZIKV infection in human epithelial cells. Increased ZIKV replication and spread in DNA-PKcs deficient cells is related to a notable decrease in transcription of type I and III interferons as well as IFIT1, IFIT2, and IL6. This was shown to be independent of IRF1, IRF3, or p65, canonical transcription factors necessary for activation of both type I and III interferon promoters. The mechanism of DNA-PKcs to restrict ZIKV infection is independent of DSB. Thus, these data suggest a non-canonical role for DNA-PK during Zika virus infection, acting downstream of IFNs transcription factors for an efficient antiviral immune response.

JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 294
SP  - 18168
EP  - 18180
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has emerged as a threat to global health. The family of adenosine deaminases acting on dsRNA (ADARs) are human host factors important for the genetic diversity and evolution of ZIKV. Here, we further investigated the role of ADAR1 in ZIKV replication by utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing and RNAi-based gene knockdown techniques. Both ADAR1 knockout and knockdown significantly reduced ZIKV RNA synthesis, protein levels, and viral titers in several human cell lines. Trans-complementation with the full-length ADAR1 form p150 or the shorter form p110 lacking the Zα domain restored viral replication levels suppressed by the ADAR1 knockout. Moreover, we observed that the nuclear p110 form was redistributed to the cytoplasm in response to ZIKV infection. ADAR1 was not involved in viral entry but promoted viral protein translation by impairing ZIKV-induced activation of protein kinase regulated by dsRNA (PKR). Of note, the RNA-editing activity of ADAR1 was not required to promote ZIKV replication. We also found that the proviral role of ADAR1 was partially mediated through its ability to suppress IFN production and PKR activation. Our work identifies ADAR1 as a proviral factor involved in ZIKV replication, suggesting that ADAR1 could be a potential antiviral target.

TI  - Doxycycline Interferes with Zika Virus Serine Protease and Inhibits Virus Replication in Human Skin Fibroblasts
JF  - Molecules
VL  - 26
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) represents a re-emerging threat to global health due to its association with congenital birth defects. ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease is crucial for virus replication by cleaving viral polyprotein at various junctions to release viral proteins and cause cytotoxic effects in ZIKV-infected cells. This study characterized the inhibitory effects of doxycycline against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease and viral replication in human skin cells. The in silico data showed that doxycycline binds to the active site of ZIKV protease at a low docking energy (−7.8 Kcal/mol) via four hydrogen bonds with the protease residues TYR1130, SER1135, GLY1151, and ASP83. Doxycycline efficiently inhibited viral NS2B-NS3 protease at average human temperature (37 °C) and human temperature with a high fever during virus infection (40 °C). Interestingly, doxycycline showed a higher inhibitory effect at 40 °C (IC50 = 5.3 µM) compared to 37 °C (9.9 µM). The virus replication was considerably reduced by increasing the concentration of doxycycline. An approximately 50% reduction in virus replication was observed at 20 µM of doxycycline. Treatment with 20 µM of doxycycline reduced the cytopathic effects (CPE), and the 40 µM of doxycycline almost eliminated the CPE of human skin cells. This study showed that doxycycline binds to the ZIKV protease and inhibits its catalytic activity at a low micro-molecular concentration range. Treatment of human skin fibroblast with doxycycline eliminated ZIKV infection and protected the cells against the cytopathic effects of the infection.

TI  - Dual roles for the ER membrane protein complex in flavivirus infection: viral entry and protein biogenesis
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 9
AB  - Hundreds of cellular host factors are required to support dengue virus infection, but their identity and roles are incompletely characterized. Here, we identify human host dependency factors required for efficient dengue virus-2 (DENV2) infection of human cells. We focused on two, TTC35 and TMEM111, which we previously demonstrated to be required for yellow fever virus (YFV) infection and others subsequently showed were also required by other flaviviruses. These proteins are components of the human endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC), which has roles in ER-associated protein biogenesis and lipid metabolism. We report that DENV, YFV and Zika virus (ZIKV) infections were strikingly inhibited, while West Nile virus infection was unchanged, in cells that lack EMC subunit 4. Furthermore, targeted depletion of EMC subunits in live mosquitoes significantly reduced DENV2 propagation in vivo. Using a novel uncoating assay, which measures interactions between host RNA-binding proteins and incoming viral RNA, we show that EMC is required at or prior to virus uncoating. Importantly, we uncovered a second and important role for the EMC. The complex is required for viral protein accumulation in a cell line harboring a ZIKV replicon, indicating that EMC participates in the complex process of viral protein biogenesis.

TI  - Dual roles of exostosin glycosyltransferase 1 in Zika virus infection
JF  - Virulence
VL  - 16
AB  - ABSTRACT Many factors involved in heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis and metabolism have been reported to play roles in viral infection. However, the detailed mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this study, we report that exostosin glycosyltransferase 1 (EXT1), the HS polymerase, is a critical regulatory factor for Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Knocking out EXT1 dramatically restricts ZIKV infection, which is not due to the inhibition of virus entry resulting from HS deficiency, but mediated by the downregulation of autophagy. Induction of autophagy promotes ZIKV infection, and attenuated autophagy is found in distinct EXT1 knockout (EXT1-KO) cell lines. Induction of autophagy by rapamycin can relieve the ZIKV production defect in EXT1-KO cells. While over-expressing EXT1 results in the reduction of ZIKV production by targeting the viral envelope (E) protein and non-structural protein NS3 in a proteasome-dependent degradation manner. The different roles of EXT1 in ZIKV infection are further confirmed by the data that knocking down EXT1 at the early stage of ZIKV infection represses viral infection, whereas the increase of ZIKV infection is observed when knocking down EXT1 at the late stage of viral infection. This study discovers previously unrecognized intricate roles of EXT1 in ZIKV infection.

TI  - Dynamic Interactions of Post Cleaved NS2B Cofactor and NS3 Protease Identified by Integrative Structural Approaches
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Diseases caused by flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile Virus (WNV), are a serious threat to public health. The flavivirus single-stranded RNA genome is translated into a polyprotein which is cleaved into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins by the viral and cellular proteases. Non-structural (NS) protein 3 is a multifunctional protein that has N-terminal protease and C-terminal helicase domains. The NS3 protease requires co-factor NS2B for enzymatic activity and folding. Due to its essential role in viral replication, NS2B-NS3 protease is an attractive target for antiviral drugs. Despite the availability of crystal structures, dynamic interactions of the N- and C-termini of NS2B co-factor have been elusive due to their flexible fold. In this study, we employ integrative structural approaches combined with biochemical assays to elucidate the dynamic interactions of the flexible DENV4 NS2B and NS3 N- and C-termini. We captured the crystal structure of self-cleaved DENV4 NS2B47NS3 protease in post cleavage state. The intermediate conformation adopted in the reported structure can be targeted by allosteric inhibitors. Comparison of our new findings from DENV4 against previously studied ZIKV NS2B-NS3 proteins reveals differences in NS2B-NS3 function between the two viruses. No inhibition of protease activity was observed for unlinked DENV NS2B-NS3 in presence of the cleavage site while ZIKV NS2B-NS3 cleavage inhibits protease activity. Another difference is that binding of the NS2B C-terminus to DENV4 eNS2B47NS3Pro active site is mediated via interactions with P4-P6 residues while for ZIKV, the binding of NS2B C-terminus to active site is mediated by P1-P3 residues. The mapping of NS2B N- and C-termini with NS3 indicates that these intermolecular interactions occur mainly on the beta-barrel 2 of the NS3 protease domain. Our integrative approach enables a comprehensive understanding of the folding and dynamic interactions of DENV NS3 protease and its cofactor NS2B.

TI  - Dynamic remodeling of lipids coincides with dengue virus replication in the midgut of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - We describe the first comprehensive analysis of the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector for arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses. Transmission of these viruses depends on their ability to infect, replicate and disseminate from several tissues in the mosquito vector. The metabolic environments within these tissues play crucial roles in these processes. Since these viruses are enveloped, viral replication, assembly and release occur on cellular membranes primed through the manipulation of host metabolism. Interference with this virus infection-induced metabolic environment is detrimental to viral replication in human and mosquito cell culture models. Here we present the first insight into the metabolic environment induced during arbovirus replication in Aedes aegypti. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we have analyzed the temporal metabolic perturbations that occur following dengue virus infection of the midgut tissue. This is the primary site of infection and replication, preceding systemic viral dissemination and transmission. We identified metabolites that exhibited a dynamic-profile across early-, mid- and late-infection time points. We observed a marked increase in the lipid content. An increase in glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and fatty acyls was coincident with the kinetics of viral replication. Elevation of glycerolipid levels suggested a diversion of resources during infection from energy storage to synthetic pathways. Elevated levels of acyl-carnitines were observed, signaling disruptions in mitochondrial function and possible diversion of energy production. A central hub in the sphingolipid pathway that influenced dihydroceramide to ceramide ratios was identified as critical for the virus life cycle. This study also resulted in the first reconstruction of the sphingolipid pathway in Aedes aegypti. Given conservation in the replication mechanisms of several flaviviruses transmitted by this vector, our results highlight biochemical choke points that could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by these mosquitoes.

TI  - Dynamics and allostery of Zika virus non-structural protein 5 methyltransferase
JF  - Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics
VL  - 39
SP  - 5526
EP  - 5538
AB  - Abstract The methyltransferase (MTase) domain of non-structural protein 5 (NS5) plays a fundamental role in flaviviruses replication, and its inhibition is a strategy for antiviral development. MTase methylates viral RNA cap at guanine N-7 and the ribose 2'OH of the first adenosine. Many structures of Zika virus (ZIKV) and other flaviviruses MTases bound to cofactors, substrates and inhibitor candidates have been solved. Still, the dynamical modulation of MTase binding and catalytic activity yet needs to be clarified. Here, we investigated the structural dynamics of ZIKV NS5 MTase domain free and bound to Guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) and S-Adenosyl-Lmethionine (SAM), to identify the molecular dynamics changes related to ligand binding and methyl transfer reaction. We have observed that the binding of the GTP and SAM individually and GTP-SAM in the ternary complex has induced allostery in the RNA binding site, showing the complexity of ZIKV MTase conformational equilibrium and its impact on viral RNA recognition. We also mapped in molecular dynamics trajectories, conformations of GTP guanine moiety that mimics guanine orientations visualized in human-specific N-methyltransferase structures solved by X-ray crystallography. It is the first time that N-7 methylation-prone guanine orientation has been proposed and modeled in flavivirus MTase. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma Graphical abstract

JF  - Biochemistry
VL  - 58 20
SP  - 2488
EP  - 2498
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) became an important public health concern because infection was correlated to the development of microcephaly and other neurological disorders. Although the structure of the virion has been determined by cryo-electron microscopy, information about the nucleocapsid is lacking. We used nuclear magnetic resonance to determine the solution structure and dynamics of full length ZIKV capsid protein (ZIKVC). Although most of the protein is structured as described for the capsid proteins of Dengue and West Nile viruses and for truncated ZIKVC (residues 23-98), here we show important differences in the α-helix 1 and N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR). We distinguished two dynamical regions in the ZIKVC IDR, a highly flexible N-terminal end and a transitional disordered region, indicating that it contains ordered segments rather than being completely flexible. The unique size and orientation of α-helix 1 partially occlude the protein hydrophobic cleft. Measurements of the dynamics of α-helix 1, surface exposure, and thermal susceptibility of each backbone amide 1H in protein structure revealed the occlusion of the hydrophobic cleft by α1/α1' and supported α-helix 1 positional uncertainty. On the basis of the findings described here, we propose that the dynamics of ZIKVC structural elements responds to a structure-driven regulation of interaction of the protein with intracellular hydrophobic interfaces, which would have an impact on the switches that are necessary for nucleocapsid assembly. Subtle differences in the sequence of α-helix 1 have an impact on its size and orientation and on the degree of exposure of the hydrophobic cleft, suggesting that α-helix 1 is a hot spot for evolutionary adaptation of the capsid proteins of flaviviruses.

VL  - 37 11
SP  - 110118
EP  - 
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an Aedes-mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes debilitating congenital and developmental disorders. Improved understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis could assist efforts to fill the therapeutic and vaccine gap. We use several ZIKV strains, including a pair differing by a single phenylalanine-to-leucine substitution (M-F37L) in the membrane (M) protein, coupled with unbiased genomics to demarcate the border between attenuated and pathogenic infection. We identify infection-induced metabolic dysregulation as a minimal set of host alterations that differentiates attenuated from pathogenic ZIKV strains. Glycolytic rewiring results in impaired oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction that trigger inflammation and apoptosis in pathogenic but not attenuated ZIKV strains. Critically, pyruvate supplementation prevents cell death, in vitro, and rescues fetal development in ZIKV-infected dams. Our findings thus demonstrate dysregulated metabolism as an underpinning of ZIKV pathogenicity and raise the potential of pyruvate supplementation in expectant women as a prophylaxis against congenital Zika syndrome.

TI  - Dysregulation of Ephrin receptor and PPAR signaling pathways in neural progenitor cells infected by Zika virus
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 9
SP  - 2046
EP  - 2060
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a serious public threat with cases reported in about 70 countries and territories. One of the most serious consequences of ZIKV infection is congenital microcephaly in babies. Congenital microcephaly has been suggested to result from infection of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the developing fetal brain. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying microcephaly development remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we employed quantitative proteomics to determine protein expression profile that occur during viral replication in NPCs. Bioinformatics analysis of the protein expression changes resulted in the identification of a wide range of cell signaling pathways. Specifically, pathways involved in neurogenesis and embryonic development were markedly altered, along with those associated with cell cycle, apoptosis, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress. Notably, the differential regulation of Ephrin Receptor and PPAR signaling pathways, as revealed by quantitative proteomics and validated by qPCR array, underscores the need to explore these pathways in disease development. Collectively, these results indicate that ZIKV-induced pathogenesis involves complex virus-host reactions; the findings reported here could help shed light on the mechanisms underlying ZIKV-induced microcephaly and ZIKV replication in NPCs.

TI  - Dysregulation of Long Non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Genes and Predicted lncRNA-Protein Interactions during Zika Virus Infection
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a causative agent for poor pregnancy outcome and fetal developmental abnormalities, including microcephaly and eye defects. As a result, ZIKV is now a confirmed teratogen. Understanding host-pathogen interactions, specifically cellular perturbations caused by ZIKV, can provide novel therapeutic targets. In order to complete viral replication, viral pathogens control the host cellular machineries and regulate various factors, including long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes, at transcriptional levels. The role of lncRNA genes in the pathogenesis of ZIKV-mediated microcephaly and eye defects is currently unknown. To gain additional insights, we focused on profiling the differentially expressed lncRNA genes during ZIKV infection in mammalian cells. For this study, we employed a contemporary clinical Zika viral isolate, PRVABC59, of Asian genotype. We utilized an unbiased RNA sequencing approach to profile the lncRNA transcriptome in ZIKV infected Vero cells. We identified a total of 121 lncRNA genes that are differentially regulated at 48 hours post-infection. The majority of these genes are independently validated by reverse-transcription qPCR. A notable observation was that the lncRNAs, MALAT1 (Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1) and NEAT1 (Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly Transcript 1), are down-regulated upon Zika viral infection. MALAT1 and NEAT1 are known as nuclear localized RNAs that regulate gene expression and cell proliferation. Protein-lncRNA interaction maps revealed that MALAT1 and NEAT1 share common interacting partners and form a larger network comprising of 71 cellular factors. ZIKV-mediated dysregulation of these two regulatory lncRNAs can alter the expression of respective target genes and associated biological functions, an important one being cell division. In conclusion, this investigation is the first to provide insight into the biological connection of lncRNAs and ZIKV which can be further explored for developing antiviral therapy and understanding fetal developmental processes.

TI  - Effective Antiviral Activity of the Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Sunitinib Malate against Zika Virus
JF  - Infection & Chemotherapy
VL  - 53
SP  - 730
EP  - 740
AB  - Introduction Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, causes the outbreaks of Latin America in 2015 - 2016, with the incidence of neurological complications. Sunitinib malate, an orally bioavailable malate salt of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is suggested as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent against emerging viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. Materials and Methods This study investigated the antiviral efficacy and antiviral mechanisms of sunitinib malate against ZIKV infection using cytopathic effect reduction, virus yield, and time-of-addition assays. Results Sunitinib malate concentration-dependently reduced ZIKV-induced cytopathic effect, the expression of viral proteins, and ZIKV yield in supernatant with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 0.015 μM, and the selectivity index of greater than 100 against ZIKV infection, respectively. Sunitinib malate had multiple antiviral actions during entry and post-entry stages of ZIKV replication. Sunitinib malate treatment at entry stage significantly reduced the levels of ZIKV RNA replication with the reduction of (+) RNA to (-) RNA ratio and the production of new intracellular infectious particles in infected cells. The treatment at post-entry stage caused a concentration-dependent increase in the levels of ZIKV (+) RNA and (-) RNA in infected cells, along with enlarging the ratio of (+) RNA to (-) RNA, but caused a pointed increase in the titer of intracellular infectious particles by 0.01 and 0.1 μM, and a substantial decrease in the titer of intracellular infectious particles by 1 μM. Conclusion The study discovered the antiviral actions of sunitinib malate against ZIKV infection, demonstrating a repurposed, host-targeted approach to identify potential antiviral drugs for treating emerging and global viral diseases.

TI  - Effects of Arboviral Infections on Transposable Element Transcript Levels in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Genome Biology and Evolution
VL  - 16
AB  - Abstract Transposable elements are mobile repeated sequences found in all genomes. Transposable elements are controlled by RNA interference pathways in most organisms, and this control involves the PIWI-interacting RNA pathway and the small interfering RNA pathway, which is also known to be the first line of antiviral defense in invertebrates. Using Drosophila, we recently showed that viral infections result in the modulation of transposable element transcript levels through modulation of the small RNA repertoire. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is of particular interest because almost half of its genome is made of transposable elements, and it is described as a major vector of viruses (such as the dengue [DENV], Zika [ZIKV], and chikungunya [CHIKV] arboviruses). Moreover, Aedes mosquitoes are unique among insects in that the PIWI-interacting RNA pathway is also involved in the somatic antiviral response, in addition to the transposable element control and PIWI-interacting RNA pathway genes expanded in the mosquito genome. For these reasons, we studied the impacts of viral infections on transposable element transcript levels in A. aegypti samples. We retrieved public datasets corresponding to RNA-seq data obtained from viral infections by DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV in various tissues. We found that transposable element transcripts are moderately modulated following viral infection and that the direction of the modulation varies greatly across tissues and viruses. These results highlight the need for an in-depth investigation of the tightly intertwined interactions between transposable elements and viruses.

TI  - Effects of the fatty acid synthase inhibitors triclosan and lapatinib on dengue virus and Zika virus infection
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 15
AB  - Fatty acid synthase (FASN) has been shown to be critical in the replication of several viruses of the genus Orthoflavivirus. In this study the role two inhibitors of FASN that work through different mechanisms were investigated in dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infections. Triclosan is a FASN inhibitor that targets the enol reductase domain of FASN, while lapatinib exerts an effect on FASN through acting on HER2, an upstream regulator of FASN. After determining cytotoxicity, a comprehensive analysis of the effect of these drugs in DENV 2 and ZIKV infection was undertaken. The results showed that triclosan had moderate antiviral activity against both DENV 2 (EC50 = 10.21 µM; Selective index (SI) = 3.99) and ZIKV ( EC50 = 22.84 µM; SI = 5.49). Lapatinib had reasonable activity against DENV 2 (EC50 = 4.9 µM; SI = 26.09), but computer modeling suggested that lapatinib had the potential to be a directly acting antiviral by binding to NS5. The result of that analysis suggested that lapatinib was a better fit with ZIKV NS5 than DENV NS5, and this was confirmed as the EC50 for lapatinib towards ZIKV was was 2 µM and the calculated SI was 37.92. The results of triclosan are consistent with other studies that use inhibitors that target other domains of FASN, suggesting that simply targeting the enzymatic activity of FASN is insufficient for therapeutic drug development, but that lapatinib, or similar molecules may have real therapeutic potential.

TI  - Effects of Zika Virus Strain and Aedes Mosquito Species on Vector Competence
JF  - Emerging Infectious Diseases
VL  - 23
SP  - 1110
EP  - 1117
AB  - In the Western Hemisphere, Zika virus is thought to be transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. To determine the extent to which Ae. albopictus mosquitoes from the United States are capable of transmitting Zika virus and the influence of virus dose, virus strain, and mosquito species on vector competence, we evaluated multiple doses of representative Zika virus strains in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Virus preparation (fresh vs. frozen) significantly affected virus infectivity in mosquitoes. We calculated 50% infectious doses to be 6.1–7.5 log10 PFU/mL; minimum infective dose was 4.2 log10 PFU/mL. Ae. albopictus mosquitoes were more susceptible to infection than Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, but transmission efficiency was higher for Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, indicating a transmission barrier in Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Results suggest that, although Zika virus transmission is relatively inefficient overall and dependent on virus strain and mosquito species, Ae. albopictus mosquitoes could become major vectors in the Americas.

TI  - Efficient Dicer processing of virus-derived double-stranded RNAs and its modulation by RIG-I-like receptor LGP2
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 17
AB  - The interferon-regulated antiviral responses are essential for the induction of both innate and adaptive immunity in mammals. Production of virus-derived small-interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) to restrict virus infection by RNA interference (RNAi) is a recently identified mammalian immune response to several RNA viruses, which cause important human diseases such as influenza and Zika virus. However, little is known about Dicer processing of viral double-stranded RNA replicative intermediates (dsRNA-vRIs) in mammalian somatic cells. Here we show that infected somatic cells produced more influenza vsiRNAs than cellular microRNAs when both were produced by human Dicer expressed de novo, indicating that dsRNA-vRIs are not poor Dicer substrates as previously proposed according to in vitro Dicer processing of synthetic long dsRNA. We report the first evidence both for canonical vsiRNA production during wild-type Nodamura virus infection and direct vsiRNA sequestration by its RNAi suppressor protein B2 in two strains of suckling mice. Moreover, Sindbis virus (SINV) accumulation in vivo was decreased by prior production of SINV-targeting vsiRNAs triggered by infection and increased by heterologous expression of B2 in cis from SINV genome, indicating an antiviral function for the induced RNAi response. These findings reveal that unlike artificial long dsRNA, dsRNA-vRIs made during authentic infection of mature somatic cells are efficiently processed by Dicer into vsiRNAs to direct antiviral RNAi. Interestingly, Dicer processing of dsRNA-vRIs into vsiRNAs was inhibited by LGP2 (laboratory of genetics and physiology 2), which was encoded by an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) shown recently to inhibit Dicer processing of artificial long dsRNA in cell culture. Our work thus further suggests negative modulation of antiviral RNAi by a known ISG from the interferon response.

TI  - Emetine inhibits Zika and Ebola virus infections through two molecular mechanisms: inhibiting viral replication and decreasing viral entry
JF  - Cell Discovery
VL  - 4
AB  - The re-emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) poses serious and continued threats to the global public health. Effective therapeutics for these maladies is an unmet need. Here, we show that emetine, an anti-protozoal agent, potently inhibits ZIKV and EBOV infection with a low nanomolar half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in vitro and potent activity in vivo. Two mechanisms of action for emetine are identified: the inhibition of ZIKV NS5 polymerase activity and disruption of lysosomal function. Emetine also inhibits EBOV entry. Cephaeline, a desmethyl analog of emetine, which may be better tolerated in patients than emetine, exhibits a similar efficacy against both ZIKV and EBOV infections. Hence, emetine and cephaeline offer pharmaceutical therapies against both ZIKV and EBOV infection.

TI  - Endocytosis of flavivirus NS1 is required for NS1-mediated endothelial hyperpermeability and is abolished by a single N-glycosylation site mutation
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 15
AB  - Arthropod-borne flaviviruses cause life-threatening diseases associated with endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leak. We recently found that vascular leak can be triggered by dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) via the disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer (EGL). However, the molecular determinants of NS1 required to trigger EGL disruption and the cellular pathway(s) involved remain unknown. Here we report that mutation of a single glycosylated residue of NS1 (N207Q) abolishes the ability of NS1 to trigger EGL disruption and induce endothelial hyperpermeability. Intriguingly, while this mutant bound to the surface of endothelial cells comparably to wild-type NS1, it was no longer internalized, suggesting that NS1 binding and internalization are distinct steps. Using endocytic pathway inhibitors and gene-specific siRNAs, we determined that NS1 was endocytosed into endothelial cells in a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent manner, which was required to trigger endothelial dysfunction in vitro and vascular leak in vivo. Finally, we found that the N207 glycosylation site is highly conserved among flaviviruses and is also essential for West Nile and Zika virus NS1 to trigger endothelial hyperpermeability via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These data provide critical mechanistic insight into flavivirus NS1-induced pathogenesis, presenting novel therapeutic and vaccine targets for flaviviral diseases.

JF  - RNA Biology
VL  - 21
SP  - 1
EP  - 10
AB  - One of the most recent advances in the analysis of viral RNA–cellular protein interactions is the Comprehensive Identification of RNA-binding Proteins by Mass Spectrometry (ChIRP-MS). Here, we used ChIRP-MS in mock-infected and Zika-infected wild-type cells and cells knockout for the zinc finger CCCH-type antiviral protein 1 (ZAP). We characterized “ZAP-independent” and “ZAP-dependent” cellular protein interactomes associated with flavivirus RNA and found that ZAP affects cellular proteins associated with Zika virus RNA. The ZAP-dependent interactome identified with ChIRP-MS provides potential ZAP co-factors for antiviral activity against Zika virus and possibly other viruses. Identifying the full spectrum of ZAP co-factors and mechanisms of how they act will be critical to understanding the ZAP antiviral system and may contribute to the development of antivirals.

TI  - Endogenous ZAP is associated with altered Zika virus infection phenotype
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 21
AB  - The zinc finger antiviral protein 1 (ZAP) has broad antiviral activity. ZAP is an interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene, which itself may enhance type I IFN antiviral response. In a previous study, Zika virus was identified as ZAP-resistant and not sensitive to ZAP antiviral activity. Here, we found that ZAP was associated with the inhibition of Zika virus in Vero cells, in the absence of a robust type I IFN system because Vero cells are deficient for IFN-alpha and -beta. Also, quantitative RNA-seq data indicated that endogenous ZAP is associated with altered global gene expression both in the steady state and during Zika virus infection. Further studies are warranted to elucidate this IFN-alpha and -beta independent anti-Zika virus activity and involvement of ZAP.

TI  - Endoplasmic reticulum: a focal point of Zika virus infection
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 27
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. It is an arbovirus that can cause congenital abnormalities and is sexually transmissible. A series of outbreaks accompanied by unexpected severe clinical complications have captured medical attention to further characterize the clinical features of congenital ZIKV syndrome and its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-related proteins are essential in ZIKV genome replication. This review highlights the subcellular localization of ZIKV to the ER and ZIKV modulation on the architecture of the ER. This review also discusses ZIKV interaction with ER proteins such as signal peptidase complex subunit 1 (SPCS1), ER membrane complex (EMC) subunits, and ER translocon for viral replication. Furthermore, the review covers several important resulting effects of ZIKV infection to the ER and cellular processes including ER stress, reticulophagy, and paraptosis-like death. Pharmacological targeting of ZIKV-affected ER-resident proteins and ER-associated components demonstrate promising signs of combating ZIKV infection and rescuing host organisms from severe neurologic sequelae.

TI  - Engineered resistance to Zika virus in transgenic Aedes aegypti expressing a polycistronic cluster of synthetic small RNAs
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 116
SP  - 3656
EP  - 3661
AB  - Significance Here, we describe the generation of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that are engineered to be resistant to Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission. Our results demonstrate that engineered mosquitoes express a polycistronic cluster of synthetic small RNAs designed to target the ZIKV genome. As a result, homozygous mosquitoes were refractory to ZIKV infection, and therefore could not transmit the virus. Additionally, mosquitoes heterozygous for the transgene showed significantly lower levels of viral infection, dissemination, and transmission compared with wild-type mosquitoes; importantly, these levels were low enough to make such mosquitoes unlikely to transmit ZIKV to a susceptible host. Finally, we discuss how such an engineering approach can be used to combat the major health burden of ZIKV, and potentially other arboviruses, in the future. Recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks have highlighted the necessity for development of novel vector control strategies to combat arboviral transmission, including genetic versions of the sterile insect technique, artificial infection with Wolbachia to reduce population size and/or vectoring competency, and gene drive-based methods. Here, we describe the development of mosquitoes synthetically engineered to impede vector competence to ZIKV. We demonstrate that a polycistronic cluster of engineered synthetic small RNAs targeting ZIKV is expressed and fully processed in Aedes aegypti, ensuring the formation of mature synthetic small RNAs in the midgut where ZIKV resides in the early stages of infection. Critically, we demonstrate that engineered Ae. aegypti mosquitoes harboring the anti-ZIKV transgene have significantly reduced viral infection, dissemination, and transmission rates of ZIKV. Taken together, these compelling results provide a promising path forward for development of effective genetic-based ZIKV control strategies, which could potentially be extended to curtail other arboviruses.

TI  - Enhancing Tissue-Specific Antiviral Immunity to Disrupt Arbovirus Transmission by Mosquitoes
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Arboviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), pose a significant global health and economic burden, with Aedes aegypti serving as their primary vector. Arbovirus infection in Ae. aegypti progresses sequentially through the midgut (MG), carcass (CA), and salivary glands (SG), with each tissue exhibiting distinct antiviral responses. Here, we investigate tissue-specific antiviral mechanisms, focusing on the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway in SGs. Our results reveal that SGs possess weaker antiviral defense and are more susceptible to arboviral infection compared to MGs and CAs. Notably, overexpression of Dicer2 (Dcr2), a key component of the siRNA pathway, in SGs leads to a significant decrease in arboviral replication. Conversely, Dcr2 overexpression in fat bodies, the primary tissue in CAs, only moderately suppresses DENV2 infection and has no notable effect on Mayaro virus (MAYV) infection. Remarkably, the simultaneous overexpression of Dcr2 in both MGs and SGs enhances antiviral activity, effectively blocking the transmission of multiple arboviruses. These findings reveal the tissue-specific dynamics of mosquito antiviral immunity and underscore the potential for targeting SG-specific immunity to disrupt arbovirus transmission, providing a promising approach for controlling mosquito-borne diseases.

TI  - Enoxacin Shows Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Activity against Diverse Viruses by Enhancing Antiviral RNA Interference in Insects
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - RNAi has been widely recognized as one of the most broadly acting and robust antiviral mechanisms in insects. However, the application of antiviral RNAi in controlling viral infections in insects is less understood. ABSTRACT RNA interference (RNAi) functions as the major host antiviral defense in insects, while less is understood about how to utilize antiviral RNAi in controlling viral infection in insects. Enoxacin belongs to the family of synthetic antibacterial compounds based on a fluoroquinolone skeleton that has been previously found to enhance RNAi in mammalian cells. In this study, we show that enoxacin efficiently inhibited viral replication of Drosophila C virus (DCV) and cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) in cultured Drosophila cells. Enoxacin promoted the loading of Dicer-2-processed virus-derived small interfering RNA (siRNA) into the RNA-induced silencing complex, thereby enhancing the antiviral RNAi response in infected cells. Moreover, enoxacin treatment elicited RNAi-dependent in vivo protective efficacy against DCV or CrPV challenge in adult fruit flies. In addition, enoxacin also inhibited the replication of flaviviruses, including dengue virus and Zika virus, in Aedes mosquito cells in an RNAi-dependent manner. Together, our findings demonstrate that enoxacin can enhance RNAi in insects, and enhancing RNAi by enoxacin is an effective antiviral strategy against diverse viruses in insects, which may be exploited as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent to control the vector transmission of arboviruses or viral diseases in insect farming. IMPORTANCE RNAi has been widely recognized as one of the most broadly acting and robust antiviral mechanisms in insects. However, the application of antiviral RNAi in controlling viral infections in insects is less understood. Enoxacin is a fluoroquinolone compound that was previously found to enhance RNAi in mammalian cells, while its RNAi-enhancing activity has not been assessed in insects. Here, we show that enoxacin treatment inhibited viral replication of DCV and CrPV in Drosophila cells and adult fruit flies. Enoxacin promoted the loading of Dicer-generated virus-derived siRNA into the Ago2-incorporated RNA-induced silencing complex and in turn strengthened the antiviral RNAi response in the infected cells. Moreover, enoxacin displayed effective RNAi-dependent antiviral effects against flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus, in mosquito cells. This study is the first to demonstrate that enhancing RNAi by enoxacin elicits potent antiviral effects against diverse viruses in insects.

TI  - Envelope Protein Glycosylation Mediates Zika Virus Pathogenesis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - It is unclear why the ability of Zika virus (ZIKV) to cause serious disease, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and birth defects, was not recognized until recent outbreaks. One contributing factor could be genetic differences between contemporary ZIKV strains and historical ZIKV strains. All isolates from recent outbreaks encode a viral envelope protein that is glycosylated, whereas many historical ZIKV strains lack this glycosylation. We generated nonglycosylated ZIKV mutants from contemporary and historical strains and evaluated their virulence in mice. We found that nonglycosylated viruses were attenuated and produced lower viral loads in serum and brains. Our studies suggest that envelope protein glycosylation contributes to ZIKV pathogenesis, possibly by facilitating attachment to and infection of lectin-expressing leukocytes. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus. Recent ZIKV outbreaks have produced serious human disease, including neurodevelopmental malformations (congenital Zika syndrome) and Guillain-Barré syndrome. These outcomes were not associated with ZIKV infection prior to 2013, raising the possibility that viral genetic changes could contribute to new clinical manifestations. All contemporary ZIKV isolates encode an N-linked glycosylation site in the envelope (E) protein (N154), but this glycosylation site is absent in many historical ZIKV isolates. Here, we investigated the role of E protein glycosylation in ZIKV pathogenesis using two contemporary Asian-lineage strains (H/PF/2013 and PRVABC59) and the historical African-lineage strain (MR766). We found that glycosylated viruses were highly pathogenic in Ifnar1−/− mice. In contrast, nonglycosylated viruses were attenuated, producing lower viral loads in the serum and brain when inoculated subcutaneously but remaining neurovirulent when inoculated intracranially. These results suggest that E glycosylation is advantageous in the periphery but not within the brain. Accordingly, we found that glycosylation facilitated infection of cells expressing the lectins dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) or DC-SIGN-related (DC-SIGNR), suggesting that inefficient infection of lectin-expressing leukocytes could contribute to the attenuation of nonglycosylated ZIKV in mice.

TI  - Envelope Protein-Targeting Zika Virus Entry Inhibitors
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 25
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV; family, Flaviviridae), which causes congenital Zika syndrome, Guillain-Barré Syndrome, and other severe diseases, is transmitted mainly by mosquitoes; however, the virus can be transmitted through other routes. Among the three structural and seven nonstructural proteins, the surface envelope (E) protein of ZIKV plays a critical role in viral entry and pathogenesis, making it a key target for the development of effective entry inhibitors. This review article describes the life cycle, genome, and encoded proteins of ZIKV, illustrates the structure and function of the ZIKV E protein, summarizes E protein-targeting entry inhibitors (with a focus on those based on natural products and small molecules), and highlights challenges that may potentially hinder the development of effective inhibitors of ZIKV infection. Overall, the article will provide useful guidance for further development of safe and potent ZIKV entry inhibitors targeting the viral E protein.

TI  - ER-shaping Atlastin proteins act as central hubs to promote flavivirus replication and virion assembly
JF  - Nature microbiology
VL  - 4
SP  - 2416
EP  - 2429
AB  - Flaviviruses, including dengue virus and Zika virus, extensively remodel the cellular endomembrane network to generate replication organelles that promote viral genome replication and virus production. However, it remains unclear how these membranes and associated cellular proteins act during the virus cycle. Here, we show that atlastins (ATLs), a subset of ER resident proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases, have dichotomous effects on flaviviruses—with ATL2 depletion leading to replication organelle defects, and ATL3 depletion to changes in virus production pathways. We characterized non-conserved functional domains in ATL paralogues and show that the ATL interactome is profoundly reprogrammed following dengue virus infection. Screen analysis confirmed non-redundant ATL functions and identified a specific role for ATL3, and its interactor ARF4, in vesicle trafficking and virion maturation. Our data identify ATLs as central hubs targeted by flaviviruses to establish their replication organelle and to achieve efficient virion maturation and secretion. Flavivirus infection leads to a rearrangement of host cell ER membranes that creates an environment permissive to viral replication. The morphology of these membrane rearrangements is known, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here, atlastins—ER-resident membrane-bound GTPases of the dynamin family—are shown to be targeted by flaviviruses to establish their replication organelle and for virion maturation and secretion.

TI  - Erp57 facilitates ZIKV-induced DNA damage via NS2B/NS3 complex formation
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 13
AB  - ABSTRACT It is believed that DNA double-strand breaks induced by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women is a main reason of brain damage (e.g. microcephaly, severe brain malformation, and neuropathy) in newborn babies [1,2], but its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we report that the depletion of ERp57, a member of the protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) family, leads to the limited production of ZIKV in nerve cells. ERp57 knockout not only suppresses viral induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated host DNA damage, but also decreases apoptosis. Strikingly, DNA damage depends on ERp57-bridged complex formation of viral protein NS2B/NS3. LOC14, an ERp57 inhibitor, restricts ZIKV infection and virus-induced DNA damage. Our work reveals an important role of ERp57 in both ZIKV propagation and virus-induced DNA damage, suggesting a potential target against ZIKV infection.

TI  - Erythromycin Estolate Inhibits Zika Virus Infection by Blocking Viral Entry as a Viral Inactivator
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - Recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) has attracted much attention in consideration of its association with severe neurological complications including fetal microcephaly. However, there are currently no prophylactic vaccines or therapeutic drugs approved for clinical treatments of ZIKV infection. To determine the potential anti-ZIKV inhibitors, we screened a library of clinical drugs with good safety profiles. Erythromycin estolate (Ery-Est), one of the macrolide antibiotics, was found to effectively inhibit ZIKV infection in different cell types and significantly protect A129 mice from ZIKV-associated neurological signs and mortality. Through further investigation, Ery-Est was verified to inhibit ZIKV entry by disrupting the integrity of the viral membrane which resulted in the loss of ZIKV infectivity. Furthermore, Ery-Est also showed inhibitory activity against dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Thus, Ery-Est may be a promising drug for patients with ZIKV infection, particularly pregnant women.

TI  - Evaluating the specificity of flavivirus proteases in Aedes aegypti cells for dengue virus 2-derived cleavage sites
JF  - PLOS ONE
VL  - 19
AB  - Flaviviruses are a diverse group of RNA viruses known for their significant impact on human health worldwide. We generated a series of reporters that included cleavage sequences from the dengue virus type 2 polyprotein and co-transfected with plasmids encoding various flavivirus proteases into Aedes aegypti cells, followed by fluorescent imaging and western blot analysis for the determination of proteolytic cleavage. Recombinant flavivirus NS2B3 proteases from medically significant and insect-specific flaviviruses were able to process reporters encoding cleavage sequences from the dengue virus type 2 polyprotein in vitro including proteases from dengue virus types 1–4, Zika virus, yellow fever virus, Aedes flavivirus, and cell-fusing agent virus. Reporters were not cleaved when transfected cells were infected with dengue virus type 2. Endoplasmic reticulum tethered reporters were also cleaved by protease alone but not by infectious virus. These results shed light on the ability of multiple flavivirus proteases to cleave sequences derived from outside of their genome and raise new questions concerning the requirements for effective cleavage by flavivirus proteases in trans.

JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) is the most notorious vector of illness-causing viruses such as Dengue, Chikugunya, and Zika. Although numerous genetic expression studies utilizing quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) have been conducted with regards to Ae. aegypti, a panel of genes to be used suitably as references for the purpose of expression-level normalization within this epidemiologically important insect is presently lacking. Here, the usability of seven widely-utilized reference genes i.e. actin (ACT), eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1α), alpha tubulin (α-tubulin), ribosomal proteins L8, L32 and S17 (RPL8, RPL32 and RPS17), and glyceraldeyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were investigated. Expression patterns of the reference genes were observed in sixteen pre-determined developmental stages and in cell culture. Gene stability was inferred from qPCR data through three freely available algorithms i.e. BestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder. The consensus rankings generated from stability values provided by these programs suggest a combination of at least two genes for normalization. ACT and RPS17 are the most dependably expressed reference genes and therefore, we propose an ACT/RPS17 combination for normalization in all Ae. aegypti derived samples. GAPDH performed least desirably, and is thus not a recommended reference gene. This study emphasizes the importance of validating reference genes in Ae. aegypti for qPCR based research.

TI  - Evasion of Innate and Intrinsic Antiviral Pathways by the Zika Virus
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a recently emerged mosquito-borne flavivirus that, while typically asymptomatic, can cause neurological symptoms in adults and birth defects in babies born to infected mothers. The interactions of ZIKV with many different pathways in the human host ultimately determine successful virus replication and ZIKV-induced pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms of such host-ZIKV interactions have just begun to be elucidated. Here, we summarize the recent advances that defined the mechanisms by which ZIKV antagonizes antiviral innate immune signaling pathways, with a particular focus on evasion of the type I interferon response in the human host. Furthermore, we describe emerging evidence that indicated the contribution of several cell-intrinsic mechanisms to an effective restriction of ZIKV infection, such as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, stress granule formation, and “reticulophagy”, a type of selective autophagy. Finally, we summarize the recent work that identified strategies by which ZIKV modulated these intrinsic antiviral responses.

TI  - Evasion strategies of Zika virus antagonizing host innate immunity
JF  - Future Virology
AB  - Zika virus is a small enveloped positive-strand RNA virus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family. The RNA genome of all flaviviruses encodes three structural and seven nonstructural genes, together with 5′- and 3′-untranslated region genes flanking. Accompanying the explosive nature of the Zika outbreak in 2014, there was a devastating congenital neurodevelopmental disease in fetuses. Apart from viral RNA replication, polyprotein cleavage, Zika virus nonstructural proteins also play vital roles in the host's innate immune evasion. In this brief report, we summarize the evasion mechanisms of the viral nonstructural proteins antagonizing host antiviral innate immunity.

TI  - Evolutionary enhancement of Zika virus infectivity in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
JF  - Nature
VL  - 545
SP  - 482
EP  - 486
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) remained obscure until the recent explosive outbreaks in French Polynesia (2013–2014) and South America (2015–2016). Phylogenetic studies have shown that ZIKV has evolved into African and Asian lineages. The Asian lineage of ZIKV was responsible for the recent epidemics in the Americas. However, the underlying mechanisms through which ZIKV rapidly and explosively spread from Asia to the Americas are unclear. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) facilitates flavivirus acquisition by mosquitoes from an infected mammalian host and subsequently enhances viral prevalence in mosquitoes. Here we show that NS1 antigenaemia determines ZIKV infectivity in its mosquito vector Aedes aegypti, which acquires ZIKV via a blood meal. Clinical isolates from the most recent outbreak in the Americas were much more infectious in mosquitoes than the FSS13025 strain, which was isolated in Cambodia in 2010. Further analyses showed that these epidemic strains have higher NS1 antigenaemia than the FSS13025 strain because of an alanine-to-valine amino acid substitution at residue 188 in NS1. ZIKV infectivity was enhanced by this amino acid substitution in the ZIKV FSS13025 strain in mosquitoes that acquired ZIKV from a viraemic C57BL/6 mouse deficient in type I and II interferon (IFN) receptors (AG6 mouse). Our results reveal that ZIKV evolved to acquire a spontaneous mutation in its NS1 protein, resulting in increased NS1 antigenaemia. Enhancement of NS1 antigenaemia in infected hosts promotes ZIKV infectivity and prevalence in mosquitoes, which could have facilitated transmission during recent ZIKV epidemics.

JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - EXOSOMES IN TRANSMISSION AND BLOCKING OF ARTHROPOD-BORNE FLAVIVIRAL INFECTION AND PATHOGENESIS Wenshuo Zhou Old Dominion University, 2020 Director: Dr. Hameeda Sultana Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are human illnesses that are transmitted by vectors such as ticks, mosquitoes, and fleas. These arthropods transmit infectious pathogens such as viruses, protozoa, and bacteria, to humans during their bloodfeeding. According to the estimation of the WHO, billions of people are affected by VBDs worldwide, and about 700,000 deaths are reported annually. Currently, very few reliable VBDs control approaches and vaccines available to treat various VBDs. Additionally, approaches to control arthropod’ proliferation and migration are difficult to develop. Furthermore, molecular determinants and mechanisms for the transmission are poorly understood. This work describes two studies identifying the novel role for exosomes in facilitating transmission of viral infectious material and viral infections. The first study focused on tick-borne pathogen transmission via exosomes derived from several different cell types. The conclusions suggested that exosomes could protect full-length viral RNA genomes, and viral proteins from host immune surveillance. The results showed the exosomes assistance in the transmission of viral materials from infected cells to naïve cells leading to active viral replication in the recipient cells. The exosomal viral materials were highly infectious and replicative in recipient cells. However, treatment with GW4869, a commercial inhibitor for neutral Sphingomyelinases that mediated-exosome formation and release, resulted in reduced viral transmission via exosomes and affected the viral replication in recipient cells. These findings suggested a novel and promising therapeutic approach to block exosome-mediated viral transmission from arthropods to humans. The second study demonstrated mosquito-borne arboviruses used exosomes for dissemination and infection of recipient vertebrate host cells as well. Results showed that ZIKV uses exosomes as mediators of viral transmission, and readily infected these neuronal cells. Neuronal exosomes enclosed both ZIKV viral RNA and proteins inside. Furthermore, the results addressed ZIKV induced both activity and gene expression of neutral Sphingomyelinase (nSMase)-2/SMPD3, a critical molecule regulates the formation and release of exosomes. The silencing of SMPD3 in neuronal cells resulted in decreased viral burden and dissemination via exosomes. Overall, this research elucidated that ZIKV mediated SMPD3 activity in cortical neurons for its infection and transmission through exosomes, perhaps caused severe neuronal death that result in neurological manifestations.

EP  - 326
AB  - ABSTRACT The harmful effects of ZIKA virus (ZIKV) infection are reflected by severe neurological manifestations such as microcephaly in neonates and other complications associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. The transmission dynamics of ZIKV in or between neurons, or within the developing brains of the foetuses are not fully understood. Using primary cultures of murine cortical neurons, we show that ZIKV uses exosomes as mediators of viral transmission between neurons. Cryo-electron microscopy showed heterogeneous population of neuronal exosomes with a size range of 30–200 nm. Increased production of exosomes from neuronal cells was noted upon ZIKV infection. Neuronal exosomes contained both ZIKV viral RNA and protein(s) that were highly infectious to naïve cells. RNaseA and neutralizing antibodies treatment studies suggest the presence of viral RNA/proteins inside exosomes. Exosomes derived from time- and dose-dependent incubations showed increasing viral loads suggesting higher packaging and delivery of ZIKV RNA and proteins. Furthermore, we noted that ZIKV induced both activity and gene expression of neutral Sphingomyelinase (nSMase)-2/SMPD3, an important molecule that regulates production and release of exosomes. Silencing of SMPD3 in neurons resulted in reduced viral burden and transmission through exosomes. Treatment with SMPD3 specific inhibitor GW4869, significantly reduced ZIKV loads in both cortical neurons and in exosomes derived from these neuronal cells. Taken together, our results suggest that ZIKV modulates SMPD3 activity in cortical neurons for its infection and transmission through exosomes perhaps leading to severe neuronal death that may result in neurological manifestations such as microcephaly in the developing embryonic brains.

TI  - Exploring Zika Virus Impact on Endothelial Permeability: Insights into Transcytosis Mechanisms and Vascular Leakage
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - Treating brain disease is challenging, and the Zika virus (ZIKV) presents a unique obstacle due to its neuroinvasive nature. In this review, we discuss the immunopathogenesis of ZIKV and explore how the virus interacts with the body’s immune responses and the role of the protein Mfsd2a in maintaining the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) during ZIKV neuroinvasion. ZIKV has emerged as a significant public health concern due to its association with severe neurological problems, including microcephaly and Gillain–Barré Syndrome (GBS). Understanding its journey through the brain—particularly its interaction with the placenta and BBB—is crucial. The placenta, which is designed to protect the fetus, becomes a pathway for ZIKV when infected. The BBB is composed of brain endothelial cells, acts as a second barrier, and protects the fetal brain. However, ZIKV finds ways to disrupt these barriers, leading to potential damage. This study explores the mechanisms by which ZIKV enters the CNS and highlights the role of transcytosis, which allows the virus to move through the cells without significantly disrupting the BBB. Although the exact mechanisms of transcytosis are unclear, research suggests that ZIKV may utilize this pathway.

TI  - Extracellular Vesicles Are Conveyors of the NS1 Toxin during Dengue Virus and Zika Virus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs), produced during viral infections, are of emerging interest in understanding infectious processes and host–pathogen interactions. EVs and exosomes in particular have the natural ability to transport nucleic acids, proteins, and other components of cellular or viral origin. Thus, they participate in intercellular communication, immune responses, and infectious and pathophysiological processes. Some viruses are known to hijack the cell production and content of EVs for their benefit. Here, we investigate whether two pathogenic flaviviruses i.e., Zika Virus (ZIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV2) could have an impact on the features of EVs. The analysis of EVs produced by infected cells allowed us to identify that the non-structural protein 1 (NS1), described as a viral toxin, is associated with exosomes. This observation could be confirmed under conditions of overexpression of recombinant NS1 from each flavivirus. Using different isolation methods (i.e., exosome isolation kit, size exclusion chromatography, Polyethylene Glycol enrichment, and ELISA capture), we showed that NS1 was present as a dimer at the surface of excreted exosomes, and that this association could occur in the extracellular compartment. This finding could be of major importance in a physiological context. Indeed, this capacity of NS1 to address EVs and its implication in the pathophysiology during Dengue or Zika diseases should be explored. Furthermore, exosomes that have demonstrated a natural capacity to vectorize NS1 could serve as useful tools for vaccine development.

AB  - Most cells can release extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane vesicles containing various proteins, nucleic acids, enzymes, and signaling molecules. The exchange of EVs between cells facilitates intercellular communication, amplification of cellular responses, immune response modulation, and perhaps alterations in viral pathogenicity. EVs serve a dual role in inhibiting or enhancing viral infection and pathogenesis. This review examines the current literature on EVs to explore the complex role of EVs in the enhancement, inhibition, and potential use as a nanotherapeutic against clinically relevant viruses, focusing on neurotropic viruses: Zika virus (ZIKV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Overall, this review’s scope will elaborate on EV-based mechanisms, which impact viral pathogenicity, facilitate viral spread, and modulate antiviral immune responses.

TI  - Extracellular Vesicles in Viral Infections of the Nervous System
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Almost all types of cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the extracellular space. EVs such as exosomes and microvesicles are membrane-bound vesicles ranging in size from 30 to 1000 nm in diameter. Under normal conditions, EVs mediate cell to cell as well as inter-organ communication via the shuttling of their cargoes which include RNA, DNA and proteins. Under pathological conditions, however, the number, size and content of EVs are found to be altered and have been shown to play crucial roles in disease progression. Emerging studies have demonstrated that EVs are involved in many aspects of viral infection-mediated neurodegenerative diseases. In the current review, we will describe the interactions between EV biogenesis and the release of virus particles while also reviewing the role of EVs in various viral infections, such as HIV-1, HTLV, Zika, CMV, EBV, Hepatitis B and C, JCV, and HSV-1. We will also discuss the potential uses of EVs and their cargoes as biomarkers and therapeutic vehicles for viral infections.

TI  - Extracellular vesicles in ZIKV infection: Carriers and facilitators of viral pathogenesis?
JF  - Science Progress
VL  - 108
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus of significant epidemiological importance, utilizing various transmission strategies and infecting “immune privileged tissues” during both the pre- and postnatal periods. One such transmission method may involve extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs can travel long distances without degrading, carrying complex messages that trigger different responses in recipient cells. They can easily cross specialized tissue barriers, such as the placental barrier and the blood-brain barrier, which protects the central nervous system. It is known that some viruses can hijack and exploit the EVs biogenesis machinery to package regulatory elements, viral segments, and even complete viral genomes. This allows them to evade the immune system, amplify their tropism, and enhance their spread. ZIKV likely uses EVs produced by infected cells to insert its genomic RNA or parts of it. This mechanism can ensure viral entry and infection of the nervous tissue, partly explaining its broad viral tropism and silent persistence in various tissues and organs for months. This narrative review summarizes the main features of ZIKV and EVs, highlighting the most recent evidence on the involvement and effects of EVs during ZIKV infection. It also discusses the possibility of EVs acting as carriers of ZIKV through the nervous tissue.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 2 enhances Zika virus infection in human fetal brain.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen that can cause microcephaly and other neurological defects in developing fetuses. The cellular response to ZIKV in the fetal brain is not well understood. Here, we show that ZIKV infection of human fetal astrocytes (HFAs), the most abundant cell type in the brain, results in elevated expression and secretion of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). This cytokine was shown to enhance replication and spread of ZIKV in HFAs and human fetal brain explants. The pro-viral effect of FGF2 is likely mediated in part by suppression of the interferon response, which would represent a novel mechanism by which viruses antagonize host antiviral defenses. We posit that FGF2-enhanced virus replication in the fetal brain contributes to the neurodevelopmental disorders associated with in utero ZIKV infection. As such, targeting FGF2-dependent signaling should be explored further as a strategy to limit replication of ZIKV.

TI  - Flavivirus Capsid Proteins Inhibit the Interferon Response
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) establishes persistent infections in multiple human tissues, a phenomenon that likely plays a role in its ability to cause congenital birth defects and neurological disease. Multiple nonstructural proteins encoded by ZIKV, in particular NS5, are known to suppress the interferon (IFN) response by attacking different steps in this critical antiviral pathway. Less well known are the potential roles of structural proteins in affecting the host immune response during ZIKV infection. Capsid proteins of flaviviruses are of particular interest because a pool of these viral proteins is targeted to the nuclei during infection and, as such, they have the potential to affect host cell gene expression. In this study, RNA-seq analyses revealed that capsid proteins from six different flaviviruses suppress expression of type I IFN and IFN-stimulated genes. Subsequent interactome and in vitro ubiquitination assays showed that ZIKV capsid protein binds to and prevents activating ubiquitination of RIG-I CARD domains by TRIM25, a host factor that is important for the induction arm of the IFN response. The other flavivirus capsid proteins also interacted with TRIM25, suggesting that these viral proteins may attenuate antiviral signaling pathways at very early stages of infection, potentially even before nonstructural proteins are produced.

TI  - Flavivirus Infection and Regulation of Host Immune and Tissue Homeostasis in Insects
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 11
AB  - Flaviviruses are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses and major human pathogens. They are responsible for causing outbreaks and therefore they represent a serious health issue worldwide (1). Because of the clinical significance of flaviviruses and the severity of epidemics they cause globally, developing efficient vaccines and drugs is critical for the success of disease control measures. Importantly, many flaviviruses, including Dengue virus (DENV), Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Yellow Fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), are vectored though arthropods (arboviruses), mainly mosquitoes and ticks (2). Although most previous efforts have primarily focused on advancing the design of therapeutic strategies for alleviating the disease symptoms caused by flaviviruses, it is equally significant to also be able to interpret the molecular nature of the interactions that take place between flaviviruses and the insect vector and determine whether these interactions affect pathophysiological processes during infection and transmission. Interactions between mosquito vectors and flaviviruses have been studied in several occasions (3). For instance, ZIKV is mainly transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and recent studies have begun to examine vector-virus relationships and transmission dynamics of this virus pathogen (4). Ae. aegypti mosquitoes infected with ZIKV activate the RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism by upregulating several virus-produced short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs and microRNAs. Many of the latter are also regulated by DENV and WNVs, but not by the alphavirus Chikungunya, indicating conservation in the mosquito response to flavivirus infection (5). Flavivirus infection in mosquito vectors activates innate immune signaling, which promotes the induction of antiviral response through the production of effector molecules (6). Activation of JAK/ STAT together with Toll signaling elevates the Ae. aegypti resistance to ZIKV infection, silencing the Toll pathway adaptor MyD88 increases DENV infection in the Ae. aegypti midgut, and DENV infection in this mosquito vector decreases the signaling activity of immune deficiency (Imd) pathway (7–9). Interestingly, the secreted protein Vago limits WNV replication in Culex mosquito cells through induction of JAK/STAT signaling (10). Studies in mosquitoes are expected to contribute toward developing efficient procedures for preventing the spread of flaviviruses. Results from research with insect vectors further stress the need for insect immunologists studying antiviral immunity to draw more attention to the outcome of flavivirus infection in insects rather than focusing exclusively on the replication efficacy of the virus. Therefore, this opinion article aims at highlighting recent studies that have started to dissect the interaction between

TI  - Flavivirus infections induce a Golgi stress response in vertebrate and mosquito cells
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 11
AB  - The stress of the Golgi apparatus is an autoregulatory mechanism that is induced to compensate for greater demand in the Golgi functions. No examples of Golgi stress responses due to physiological stimuli are known. Furthermore, the impact on this organelle of viral infections that occupy the vesicular transport during replication is unknown. In this work, we evaluated if a Golgi stress response is triggered during dengue and Zika viruses replication, two flaviviruses whose replicative cycle is heavily involved with the Golgi complex, in vertebrate and mosquito cells. Using GM-130 as a Golgi marker, and treatment with monensin as a positive control for the induction of the Golgi stress response, a significant expansion of the Golgi cisternae was observed in BHK-21, Vero E6 and mosquito cells infected with either virus. Activation of the TFE3 pathway was observed in the infected cells as indicated by the translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of TFE3 and increased expression of pathway targeted genes. Of note, no sign of activation of the stress response was observed in CRFK cells infected with Feline Calicivirus (FCV), a virus released by cell lysis, not requiring vesicular transport. Finally, dilatation of the Golgi complex and translocation of TFE3 was observed in vertebrate cells expressing dengue and Zika viruses NS1, but not NS3. These results indicated that infections by dengue and Zika viruses induce a Golgi stress response in vertebrate and mosquito cells due to the increased demand on the Golgi complex imposed by virion and NS1 processing and secretion.

TI  - Flavivirus internalization is regulated by a size-dependent endocytic pathway
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 115
SP  - 4246
EP  - 4251
AB  - Significance Flaviviruses are a globally important group of human viral pathogens. These viruses enter cells by hijacking an endocytic pathway, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, used by cells to take up growth factors and nutrients. While most cargo is small, virions are large, and we identified host factors specifically required for the internalization of large cargo including these viruses. These studies define a set of requirements for viral internalization and which may be amenable to therapeutic interventions. Flaviviruses enter host cells through the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the spectrum of host factors required for this process are incompletely understood. Here we found that lymphocyte antigen 6 locus E (LY6E) promotes the internalization of multiple flaviviruses, including West Nile virus, Zika virus, and dengue virus. Perhaps surprisingly, LY6E is dispensable for the internalization of the endogenous cargo transferrin, which is also dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis for uptake. Since viruses are substantially larger than transferrin, we reasoned that LY6E may be required for uptake of larger cargoes and tested this using transferrin-coated beads of similar size as flaviviruses. LY6E was indeed required for the internalization of transferrin-coated beads, suggesting that LY6E is selectively required for large cargo. Cell biological studies found that LY6E forms tubules upon viral infection and bead internalization, and we found that tubule formation was dependent on RNASEK, which is also required for flavivirus internalization, but not transferrin uptake. Indeed, we found that RNASEK is also required for the internalization of transferrin-coated beads, suggesting it functions upstream of LY6E. These LY6E tubules resembled microtubules, and we found that microtubule assembly was required for their formation and flavivirus uptake. Since microtubule end-binding proteins link microtubules to downstream activities, we screened the three end-binding proteins and found that EB3 promotes virus uptake and LY6E tubularization. Taken together, these results highlight a specialized pathway required for the uptake of large clathrin-dependent endocytosis cargoes, including flaviviruses.

TI  - Flavivirus maturation leads to the formation of an occupied lipid pocket in the surface glycoproteins
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 12
AB  - Flaviviruses such as Dengue (DENV) or Zika virus (ZIKV) assemble into an immature form within the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), and are then processed by furin protease in the trans-Golgi. To better grasp maturation, we carry out cryo-EM reconstructions of immature Spondweni virus (SPOV), a human flavivirus of the same serogroup as ZIKV. By employing asymmetric localised reconstruction we push the resolution to 3.8 Å, enabling us to refine an atomic model which includes the crucial furin protease recognition site and a conserved Histidine pH-sensor. For direct comparison, we also solve structures of the mature forms of SPONV and DENV to 2.6 Å and 3.1 Å, respectively. We identify an ordered lipid that is present in only the mature forms of ZIKV, SPOV, and DENV and can bind as a consequence of rearranging amphipathic stem-helices of E during maturation. We propose a structural role for the pocket and suggest it stabilizes mature E. Here, the authors provide cryo-EM structures of mature and immature Spondweni virus, defining the furin recognition site at high resolution, and identifying a lipid that binds E upon capsid maturation and is also present in Zika and Dengue virions.

TI  - Flavivirus NS1 Triggers Tissue-Specific Disassembly of Intercellular Junctions Leading to Barrier Dysfunction and Vascular Leak in a GSK-3β-Dependent Manner
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected cells and contributes to endothelial barrier dysfunction and vascular leak in a tissue-dependent manner. This phenomenon occurs in part via disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) lining the endothelium. Additionally, we and others have shown that soluble DENV NS1 induces disassembly of intercellular junctions (IJCs), a group of cellular proteins critical for maintaining endothelial homeostasis and regulating vascular permeability; however, the specific mechanisms by which NS1 mediates IJC disruption remain unclear. Here, we investigated the relative contribution of five flavivirus NS1 proteins, from dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), and yellow fever (YFV) viruses, to the expression and localization of the intercellular junction proteins β-catenin and VE-cadherin in endothelial cells from human umbilical vein and brain tissues. We found that flavivirus NS1 induced the mislocalization of β-catenin and VE-cadherin in a tissue-dependent manner, reflecting flavivirus disease tropism. Mechanistically, we observed that NS1 treatment of cells triggered internalization of VE-cadherin, likely via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and phosphorylation of β-catenin, part of a canonical IJC remodeling pathway during breakdown of endothelial barriers that activates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Supporting this model, we found that a chemical inhibitor of GSK-3β reduced both NS1-induced permeability of human umbilical vein and brain microvascular endothelial cell monolayers in vitro and vascular leakage in a mouse dorsal intradermal model. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction and identify GSK-3β as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of vascular leakage during severe dengue disease.

TI  - Flavivirus NS1: a multifaceted enigmatic viral protein
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 13
AB  - Flaviviruses are emerging arthropod-borne viruses representing an immense global health problem. The prominent viruses of this group include dengue virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus tick borne encephalitis virus and Zika Virus. These are endemic in many parts of the world. They are responsible for the illness ranging from mild flu like symptoms to severe hemorrhagic, neurologic and cognitive manifestations leading to death. NS1 is a highly conserved non-structural protein among flaviviruses, which exist in diverse forms. The intracellular dimer form of NS1 plays role in genome replication, whereas, the secreted hexamer plays role in immune evasion. The secreted NS1 has been identified as a potential diagnostic marker for early detection of the infections caused by flaviviruses. In addition to the diagnostic marker, the importance of NS1 has been reported in the development of therapeutics. NS1 based subunit vaccines are at various stages of development. The structural details and diverse functions of NS1 have been discussed in detail in this review.

TI  - Flavivirus NS2A orchestrates reticulophagy to enhance viral pathogenicity
JF  - Autophagy
VL  - 21
SP  - 1167
EP  - 1168
AB  - ABSTRACT Selective endoplasmic reticulum (ER) autophagy (reticulophagy) is essential for maintaining ER homeostasis. The E3 ligase AMFR facilitates the ubiquitination of the reticulophagy receptor RETREG1/FAM134B, thereby promoting the dynamic flux of the reticulophagy process. Flaviviruses exploit the ER during their replication cycles, highlighting the importance of ER quantity and accessibility in flavivirus infections. However, the role of reticulophagy in viral replication and the complex mechanisms by which viruses modulate reticulophagy to enhance pathogenicity remain poorly understood. In a recent study, we demonstrate that the Zika virus (ZIKV) hijacks the ER-located E3 ligase AMFR to ubiquitinate NS2A, leading to the degradation of the key reticulophagy receptor RETREG1. This inhibition of the reticulophagy process promotes virus-induced microcephaly in human brain organoids and enhances viral pathogenicity in mouse models. Notably, the AMFR-mediated ubiquitination of ZIKV-NS2A and its functional interaction with RETREG1 are conserved across the NS2A of other flaviviruses, including those from Dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus.

TI  - Flavivirus prM interacts with MDA5 and MAVS to inhibit RLR antiviral signaling
JF  - Cell & Bioscience
VL  - 13
AB  - Background Vector-borne flaviviruses, including tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), pose a growing threat to public health worldwide, and have evolved complex mechanisms to overcome host antiviral innate immunity. However, the underlying mechanisms of flavivirus structural proteins to evade host immune response remain elusive. Results We showed that TBEV structural protein, pre-membrane (prM) protein, could inhibit type I interferon (IFN-I) production. Mechanically, TBEV prM interacted with both MDA5 and MAVS and interfered with the formation of MDA5-MAVS complex, thereby impeding the nuclear translocation and dimerization of IRF3 to inhibit RLR antiviral signaling. ZIKV and WNV prM was also demonstrated to interact with both MDA5 and MAVS, while dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) and YFV prM associated only with MDA5 or MAVS to suppress IFN-I production. In contrast, JEV prM could not suppress IFN-I production. Overexpression of TBEV and ZIKV prM significantly promoted the replication of TBEV and Sendai virus. Conclusion Our findings reveal the immune evasion mechanisms of flavivirus prM, which may contribute to understanding flavivirus pathogenicity, therapeutic intervention and vaccine development.

TI  - Flavivirus Zika NS4A protein forms large oligomers in liposomes and in mild detergent
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 14
AB  - In flaviviruses such as Dengue or Zika, non-structural (NS) NS4A protein forms homo-oligomers, participates in membrane remodelling and is critical for virulence. In both viruses, mature NS4A has the same length and three predicted hydrophobic domains. The oligomers formed by Dengue NS4A are reported to be small (n = 2, 3), based on denaturing SDS gels, but no high-resolution structure of a flavivirus NS4A protein is available, and the size of the oligomer in lipid membranes is not known. Herein we show that crosslinking Zika NS4A protein in lipid membranes results in oligomers at least up to hexamers. Further, sedimentation velocity shows that NS4A in mild detergent C14-betaine appears to be in fast equilibrium between at least two species, where one is smaller, and the other larger, than a trimer or a tetramer. Consistently, sedimentation equilibrium data was best fitted to a model involving an equilibrium between dimers (n = 2) and hexamers (n = 6). Overall, the large, at least hexameric, oligomers obtained herein in liposomes and in mild detergent are more likely to represent the forms of NS4A present in cell membranes.

TI  - Flaviviruses induce ER-specific remodelling of protein synthesis
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 20
AB  - Flaviviruses orchestrate a unique remodelling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to facilitate translation and processing of their polyprotein, giving rise to virus replication compartments. While the signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent pathway is the canonical route for ER-targeting of nascent cellular membrane proteins, it is unknown whether flaviviruses rely on this mechanism. Here we show that Zika virus bypasses the SRP receptor via extensive interactions between the viral non-structural proteins and the host translational machinery. Remarkably, Zika virus appears to maintain ER-localised translation via NS3-SRP54 interaction instead, unlike other viruses such as influenza. Viral proteins engage SRP54 and the translocon, selectively enriching for factors supporting membrane expansion and lipid metabolism while excluding RNA binding and antiviral stress granule proteins. Our findings reveal a sophisticated viral strategy to rewire host protein synthesis pathways and create a replication-favourable subcellular niche, providing insights into viral adaptation.

TI  - Flavors of Flaviviral RNA Structure: towards an Integrated View of RNA Function from Translation through Encapsidation
JF  - Bioessays
VL  - 41
AB  - For many viruses, RNA is the holder of genetic information and serves as the template for both replication and translation. While host and viral proteins play important roles in viral decision‐making, the extent to which viral RNA (vRNA) actively participates in translation and replication might be surprising. Here, the focus is on flaviviruses, which include common human scourges such as dengue, West Nile, and Zika viruses, from an RNA‐centric viewpoint. In reviewing more recent findings, an attempt is made to fill knowledge gaps and revisit some canonical views of vRNA structures involved in replication. In particular, alternative views are offered on the nature of the flaviviral promoter and genome cyclization, and the feasibility of refining in vitro‐derived models with modern RNA probing and sequencing methods is pointed out. By tracing vRNA structures from translation through encapsidation, a dynamic molecule closely involved in the self‐regulation of viral replication is revealed.

TI  - Fragile X mental retardation protein is a Zika virus restriction factor that is antagonized by subgenomic flaviviral RNA
JF  - eLife
VL  - 7
AB  - Subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) accumulates during infection due to incomplete degradation of viral genomes and interacts with cellular proteins to promote infection. Here we identify host proteins that bind the Zika virus (ZIKV) sfRNA. We identified fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) as a ZIKV sfRNA-binding protein and confirmed this interaction in cultured cells and mouse testes. Depletion of FMRP elevated viral translation and enhanced ZIKV infection, indicating that FMRP is a ZIKV restriction factor. We further observed that an attenuated ZIKV strain compromised for sfRNA production was disproportionately stimulated by FMRP knockdown, suggesting that ZIKV sfRNA antagonizes FMRP activity. Importantly, ZIKV infection and expression of ZIKV sfRNA upregulated endogenous FMRP target genes in cell culture and ZIKV-infected mice. Together, our observations identify FMRP as a ZIKV restriction factor whose activity is antagonized by the sfRNA. Interaction between ZIKV and FMRP has significant implications for the pathogenesis of ZIKV infections.

TI  - Functional Genomics and Immunologic Tools: The Impact of Viral and Host Genetic Variations on the Outcome of Zika Virus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 10
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) causes no-to-mild symptoms or severe neurological disorders. To investigate the importance of viral and host genetic variations in determining ZIKV infection outcomes, we created three full-length infectious cDNA clones as bacterial artificial chromosomes for each of three spatiotemporally distinct and genetically divergent ZIKVs: MR-766 (Uganda, 1947), P6-740 (Malaysia, 1966), and PRVABC-59 (Puerto Rico, 2015). Using the three molecularly cloned ZIKVs, together with 13 ZIKV region-specific polyclonal antibodies covering nearly the entire viral protein-coding region, we made three conceptual advances: (i) We created a comprehensive genome-wide portrait of ZIKV gene products and their related species, with several previously undescribed gene products identified in the case of all three molecularly cloned ZIKVs. (ii) We found that ZIKV has a broad cell tropism in vitro, being capable of establishing productive infection in 16 of 17 animal cell lines from 12 different species, although its growth kinetics varied depending on both the specific virus strain and host cell line. More importantly, we identified one ZIKV-non-susceptible bovine cell line that has a block in viral entry but fully supports the subsequent post-entry steps. (iii) We showed that in mice, the three molecularly cloned ZIKVs differ in their neuropathogenicity, depending on the particular combination of viral and host genetic backgrounds, as well as in the presence or absence of type I/II interferon signaling. Overall, our findings demonstrate the impact of viral and host genetic variations on the replication kinetics and neuropathogenicity of ZIKV and provide multiple avenues for developing and testing medical countermeasures against ZIKV.

TI  - Functional Mapping of AGO-Associated Zika Virus-Derived Small Interfering RNAs in Neural Stem Cells
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Viral interfering RNA (viRNA) has been identified from several viral genomes via directly deep RNA sequencing of the virus-infected cells, including zika virus (ZIKV). Once produced by endoribonuclease Dicer, viRNAs are loaded onto the Argonaute (AGO) family proteins of the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) to pair with their RNA targets and initiate the cleavage of target genes. However, the identities of functional ZIKV viRNAs and their viral RNA targets remain largely unknown. Our recent study has shown that ZIKV capsid protein interacted with Dicer and antagonized its endoribonuclease activity, which requires its histidine residue at the 41st amino acid. Accordingly, the engineered ZIKV-H41R loss-of-function (LOF) mutant virus no longer suppresses Dicer enzymatic activity nor inhibits miRNA biogenesis in NSCs. By combining AGO-associated RNA sequencing, deep sequencing analysis in ZIKV-infected human neural stem cells (NSCs), and miRanda target scanning, we defined 29 ZIKV derived viRNA profiles in NSCs, and established a complex interaction network between the viRNAs and their viral targets. More importantly, we found that viRNA production from the ZIKV mRNA is dependent on Dicer function and is a limiting factor for ZIKV virulence in NSCs. As a result, much higher levels of viRNAs generated from the ZIKV-H41R virus-infected NSCs. Therefore, our mapping of viRNAs to their RNA targets paves a way to further investigate how viRNAs play the role in anti-viral mechanisms, and perhaps other unknown biological functions.

TI  - Functional Polymorphisms in the p53 Pathway Genes on the Genetic Susceptibility to Zika Virus Teratogenesis
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) occurs in up to 42% of individuals exposed to ZIKV prenatally. Deregulation in gene expression and protein levels of components of the p53 signaling pathway, such as p53 and MDM2, due to ZIKV infection has been reported. Here, we evaluate functional polymorphisms in genes of the p53 signaling pathway as risk factors to CZS. Forty children born with CZS and forty-eight children exposed to ZIKV, but born without congenital anomalies were included in this study. Gestational and sociodemographic information as well as the genotypic and allelic frequencies of functional polymorphisms in TP53, MDM2, MIR605 and LIF genes were compared between the two groups. We found children with CZS exposed predominantly in the first trimester and controls in the third trimester (p<0.001). Moreover, children with CZS were predominantly from families with a lower socioeconomic level (p=0.008). We did not find a statistically significant association between the investigated polymorphisms and development of CZS; however, by comparing individuals with CZS and lissencephaly or without lissencephaly, we found a significative difference in the allelic frequencies of the TP53 rs1042522, which is associated with a more potent p53-induced apoptosis (p=0.007). Our findings suggest that the TP53 rs1042522 polymorphism should be better investigate as a genetic risk factor for the development of lissencephaly in children with CZS.

TI  - Functional Roles and Host Interactions of Orthoflavivirus Non-Structural Proteins During Replication
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - Orthoflavivirus, a genus encompassing arthropod-borne, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses in the Flaviviridae family, represents clinically relevant viruses that pose significant threats to human and animal health worldwide. With warming climates and persistent urbanization, arthropod vectors and the viruses they transmit continue to widen their geographic distribution, expanding endemic zones. Flaviviruses such as dengue virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus cause debilitating and fatal infections globally. In 2024, the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization declared the current dengue situation a Multi-Country Grade 3 Outbreak, the highest level. FDA-approved treatment options for diseases caused by flaviviruses are limited or non-existent, and vaccines are suboptimal for many flaviviruses. Understanding the molecular characteristics of the flavivirus life cycle, virus-host interactions, and resulting pathogenesis in various cells and model systems is critical for developing effective therapeutic intervention strategies. This review will focus on the virus-host interactions of mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses from the virus replication and assembly perspective, emphasizing the interplay between viral non-structural proteins and host pathways that are hijacked for their advantage. Highlighting interaction pathways, including innate immunity, intracellular movement, and membrane modification, emphasizes the need for rigorous and targeted antiviral research and development against these re-emerging viruses.

TI  - Fundamental neurochemistry review: Glutamatergic dysfunction as a central mechanism underlying flavivirus‐induced neurological damage
JF  - Journal of Neurochemistry
VL  - 166
SP  - 915
EP  - 927
AB  - The Flaviviridae family comprises positive‐sense single‐strand RNA viruses mainly transmitted by arthropods. Many of these pathogens are especially deleterious to the nervous system, and a myriad of neurological symptoms have been associated with infections by Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in humans. Studies suggest that viral replication in neural cells and the massive release of pro‐inflammatory mediators lead to morphological alterations of synaptic spine structure and changes in the balance of excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitters and receptors. Glutamate is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and studies propose that either enhanced release or impaired uptake of this amino acid contributes to brain damage in several conditions. Here, we review existing evidence suggesting that glutamatergic dysfunction‐induced by flaviviruses is a central mechanism for neurological damage and clinical outcomes of infection. We also discuss current data suggesting that pharmacological approaches that counteract glutamatergic dysfunction show benefits in animal models of such viral diseases.

TI  - Galidesivir Triphosphate Promotes Stalling of Dengue-2 Virus Polymerase Immediately Prior to Incorporation
JF  - ACS Infectious Diseases
VL  - 9
SP  - 1658
EP  - 1673
AB  - Millions of people are infected by the dengue and Zika viruses each year, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Galidesivir is an adenosine nucleoside analog that can attenuate flavivirus replication in cell-based assays and animal models of infection. Galidesivir is converted to the triphosphorylated form by host kinases and subsequently incorporated into viral RNA by viral RNA polymerases. This has been proposed to lead to the delayed termination of RNA synthesis. Here, we report direct in vitro testing of the effects of Galidesivir triphosphate on dengue-2 and Zika virus polymerase activity. Galidesivir triphosphate was chemically synthesized, and inhibition of RNA synthesis followed using a dinucleotide-primed assay with a homopolymeric poly(U) template. Galidesivir triphosphate was equipotent against dengue-2 and Zika polymerases, with IC50 values of 42 ± 12 μM and 47 ± 5 μM, respectively, at an ATP concentration of 20 μM. RNA primer extension assays show that the dengue-2 polymerase stalls while attempting to add a Galidesivir nucleotide to the nascent RNA chain, evidenced by the accumulation of RNA products truncated immediately upstream of Galidesivir incorporation sites. Nevertheless, Galidesivir is incorporated at isolated sites with low efficiency, leading to the subsequent synthesis of full-length RNA with no evidence of delayed chain termination. The incorporation of Galidesivir at consecutive sites is strongly disfavored, highlighting the potential for modulation of inhibitory effects of nucleoside analogs by the template sequence. Our results suggest that attenuation of dengue replication by Galidesivir may not derive from the early termination of RNA synthesis following Galidesivir incorporation.

JF  - Open Forum Infectious Diseases
VL  - 4
SP  - S55
EP  - S55
AB  - Abstract Background Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in 1947. ZIKV infection in humans is associated with serious neurological and reproductive complications. No antiviral or protective vaccine is yet available. Galidesivir an adenosine analog is a potent viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor with demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Methods We have conducted four pre-clinical studies in rhesus macaques to assess the safety, antiviral efficacy and dosing strategies of galidesivir against ZIKV infection. Collectively, we have challenged 70 rhesus macaques by various routes using 1x105 TCID50of a Puerto Rican ZIKV isolate. We have evaluated galidesivir therapy administered via IM injection as early as 90 minutes and up to 72 hours after subcutaneous (SC) ZIKV challenge, and as late as 5 days after intravaginal (IVAG) challenge. In these studies, we evaluated the efficacy of a range of loading and maintence doses of galidesivir. The highest dose evaluated has been a loading dose of 100mg/kg BID followed by a maintenance dose of 25mg/kg BID for nine days. We followed multiple endpoints, including ZIKV RNA levels in plasma, urine, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid. Immune activation, complete blood counts, chemistries and galidesivir pharmacokinetics were also monitored. Results Galidesivir was well-tolerated in all studies. All untreated controls developed high-level plasma viremia, and had readily detectable ZIKV RNA in CSF, saliva and urine post-infection. Animals treated in the first 24 hours after SC ZIKV challenge did not develop plasma viremia and were either negative or had significantly reduced ZIKV RNA in bodily fluids. Animals treated with galidesivir later (up to 72 hours) were partially protected; they had detectable plasma ZIKV RNA, but the onset was delayed and/or magnitude significantly reduced compared with controls. Animals infected IVAG were protected by galidesivir treatment up until day 5 after infection, with no blood viremia and significant reductions in ZIKV RNA in the CSF as compared with controls. Conclusion Galidesivir dosing in rhesus macaques was well-tolerated and offered significant protection against ZIKV infection. These results warrant continued study and clinical evaluation.

VL  - 8

EP  - 602
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) can cause devastating congenital Zika syndromes in pregnant women and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Understanding the molecular mechanism of ZIKV replication is essential for antiviral and vaccine development. Here we report the structural and functional characterization of ZIKV NS2A protein. Biochemical structural probing suggests that ZIKV NS2A has a single segment that traverses the ER membrane and six segments that peripherally associate with the ER membrane. Functional analysis has defined distinct NS2A residues essential for viral RNA synthesis or virion assembly. Only the virion assembly-defective mutants, but not the RNA synthesis-defective mutants, could be rescued through trans complementation with a wide-type NS2A protein. These results suggest that the NS2A molecules in virion assembly complex could be recruited in trans, whereas the NS2A molecules in viral replication complex must be recruited in cis. Together with previous results, we propose a flavivirus assembly model where NS2A plays a central role in modulating viral structural and nonstructural proteins as well as genomic RNA during virion assembly.

TI  - Genetic dissection of Flaviviridae host factors through genome-scale CRISPR screens
JF  - Nature
VL  - 535
SP  - 159
EP  - 163
AB  - The Flaviviridae are a family of viruses that cause severe human diseases. For example, dengue virus (DENV) is a rapidly emerging pathogen causing an estimated 100 million symptomatic infections annually worldwide. No approved antivirals are available to date, and clinical trials with a tetravalent dengue vaccine showed disappointingly low protection rates. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) also remains a major medical problem, with 160 million chronically infected patients worldwide and only expensive treatments available. Despite distinct differences in their pathogenesis and modes of transmission, the two viruses share common replication strategies. A detailed understanding of the host functions that determine viral infection is lacking. Here we use a pooled CRISPR genetic screening strategy to comprehensively dissect host factors required for these two highly important Flaviviridae members. For DENV, we identified endoplasmic-reticulum (ER)-associated multi-protein complexes involved in signal sequence recognition, N-linked glycosylation and ER-associated degradation. DENV replication was nearly completely abrogated in cells deficient in the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. Mechanistic studies pinpointed viral RNA replication and not entry or translation as the crucial step requiring the OST complex. Moreover, we show that viral non-structural proteins bind to the OST complex. The identified ER-associated protein complexes were also important for infection by other mosquito-borne flaviviruses including Zika virus, an emerging pathogen causing severe birth defects. By contrast, the most significant genes identified in the HCV screen were distinct and included viral receptors, RNA-binding proteins and enzymes involved in metabolism. We found an unexpected link between intracellular flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) levels and HCV replication. This study shows notable divergence in host-dependency factors between DENV and HCV, and illuminates new host targets for antiviral therapy.

TI  - Genome-wide Associations of Flavivirus Capsid Proteins
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are both positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses. They are packaged within the virion with a capsid (C) protein to form the nucleocapsid. Based on cryo-electron microscopy imaging, the nucleocapsid has been described as lacking symmetry, whilst there is distinguishable separation of the C proteins from the viral RNA (vRNA) genome. Here, to elucidate the architecture of the nucleocapsid of DENV serotype 2 and ZIKV, we used a nuclease digestion assay and next-generation sequencing to map the respective vRNA genome wide association with the C protein in vitro. The C protein exhibited non-uniform binding along the vRNA, and as C protein concentration increased, the normalized read counts also increased. A saturation point of 1:100 (vRNA:C protein monomers) was found, and binding regions showed variable saturation patterns. We also observed that C protein had a preference for G-rich sequences for both viruses. Taken together, we demonstrate that the DENV 2 and ZIKV C proteins bind vRNA in a non-uniform manner with distinct patterns of association. Singificance Statement Our study demonstrates that flavivirus capsid proteins associate with the viral genome at specific sites rather than in a uniform manner as commonly expected. We estimate the number of capsid proteins binding to a single genomic RNA. We proceed to locate the capsid binding sites along the viral genomes of Dengue and Zika viruses. We characterize the binding sites in terms of affinity and analyze the nucleotide composition and sequence motifs at binding sites. We cross-reference binding sites against SHAPE reactivity data corresponding to local RNA secondary structure, which allows us to identify structural motifs of capsid binding sites. As capsid proteins are essential for viral packaging, these interactions may form attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Significance Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurotropic and neurovirulent arbovirus that has severe detrimental impact on the developing human fetal brain. We used a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen to identify ZIKV host genes in human neural progenitors. The screen identified host factors involved in heparan sulfation, endocytosis, endoplasmic reticulum processing, Golgi function, and interferon activity. Our findings provide insights into host-dependent mechanisms for ZIKV infection in the highly vulnerable human neural progenitor cells and identify molecular targets for potential therapeutic intervention. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurotropic and neurovirulent arbovirus that has severe detrimental impact on the developing human fetal brain. To date, little is known about the factors required for ZIKV infection of human neural cells. We identified ZIKV host genes in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural progenitors (NPs) using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen. Mutations of host factors involved in heparan sulfation, endocytosis, endoplasmic reticulum processing, Golgi function, and interferon activity conferred resistance to infection with the Uganda strain of ZIKV and a more recent North American isolate. Host genes essential for ZIKV replication identified in human NPs also provided a low level of protection against ZIKV in isogenic human astrocytes. Our findings provide insights into host-dependent mechanisms for ZIKV infection in the highly vulnerable human NP cells and identify molecular targets for potential therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Genome-Wide CRISPR Screen Identifies RACK1 as a Critical Host Factor for Flavivirus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Cellular factors are critical in all facets of viral lifecycles, where overlapping interactions between the virus and host can be exploited as possible avenues for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Using a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening approach to identify novel cellular factors important for flavivirus replication we identified RACK1 as a pro-viral host factor for both mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2. ABSTRACT Cellular factors have important roles in all facets of the flavivirus replication cycle. Deciphering viral-host protein interactions is essential for understanding the flavivirus life cycle as well as development of effective antiviral strategies. To uncover novel host factors that are co-opted by multiple flaviviruses, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome wide knockout (KO) screen was employed to identify genes required for replication of Zika virus (ZIKV). Receptor for Activated Protein C Kinase 1 (RACK1) was identified as a novel host factor required for ZIKV replication, which was confirmed via complementary experiments. Depletion of RACK1 via siRNA demonstrated that RACK1 is important for replication of a wide range of mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses, including West Nile Virus (WNV), Dengue Virus (DENV), Powassan Virus (POWV) and Langat Virus (LGTV) as well as the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, but not for YFV, EBOV, VSV or HSV. Notably, flavivirus replication was only abrogated when RACK1 expression was dampened prior to infection. Utilising a non-replicative flavivirus model, we show altered morphology of viral replication factories and reduced formation of vesicle packets (VPs) in cells lacking RACK1 expression. In addition, RACK1 interacted with NS1 protein from multiple flaviviruses; a key protein for replication complex formation. Overall, these findings reveal RACK1’s crucial role to the biogenesis of pan-flavivirus replication organelles. IMPORTANCE Cellular factors are critical in all facets of viral lifecycles, where overlapping interactions between the virus and host can be exploited as possible avenues for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Using a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening approach to identify novel cellular factors important for flavivirus replication we identified RACK1 as a pro-viral host factor for both mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2. Using an innovative flavivirus protein expression system, we demonstrate for the first time the impact of the loss of RACK1 on the formation of viral replication factories known as 'vesicle packets' (VPs). In addition, we show that RACK1 can interact with numerous flavivirus NS1 proteins as a potential mechanism by which VP formation can be induced by the former.

TI  - Genome-wide discovery of local RNA structural elements in Zika virus
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - In addition to encoding RNA primary structures, genomes also encode RNA secondary and tertiary structures that play roles in gene regulation and, in the case of RNA viruses, genome replication. Methods for the identification of functional RNA structures in genomes typically rely on scanning analysis windows, where multiple partially-overlapping windows are used to predict RNA structures and folding metrics to deduce regions likely to form functional structure. Separate structural models are produced for each window, where the step size can greatly affect the returned model. This makes deducing unique local structures challenging, as the same nucleotides in each window can be alternatively base paired. In the presented approach, all base pairs from all analysis windows are considered and weighted by favorable folding metrics throughout all windows. This results in unique base pairing throughout the genome and the generation of local regions/structures that can be ranked by their propensity to form unusually thermodynamically stable folds.
 This approach was applied to the Zika virus (ZIKV) genome. ZIKV is linked to a variety of neurological ailments including microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome and its (+)-sense RNA genome encodes two, previously described, functionally essential structured RNA regions. Our approach is able to successfully identify and model the structures of these regions, while also finding additional regions likely to form functional RNA structures throughout the viral polyprotein coding region. All data for the ZIKV genome have been archived at the RNAStructuromeDB, a repository of RNA folding data for humans and their pathogens.

TI  - Genome-wide identification of Aedes albopictus long noncoding RNAs and their association with dengue and zika virus infection
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Ae. albopictus), is an important vector that transmits arboviruses such as dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). On the other hand, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to regulate various biological processes. Knowledge on Ae. albopictus lncRNAs and their functional role in virus-host interactions are still limited. Here, we identified and characterized the lncRNAs in the genome of an arbovirus vector, Ae. albopictus, and evaluated their potential involvement in DENV and ZIKV infection. We used 148 public datasets, and identified a total of 10, 867 novel lncRNA transcripts, of which 5,809, 4,139, and 919 were intergenic, intronic and antisense respectively. The Ae. albopictus lncRNAs shared many characteristics with other species such as short length, low GC content, and low sequence conservation. RNA-sequencing of Ae. albopictus cells infected with DENV and ZIKV showed that the expression of lncRNAs was altered upon virus infection. Target prediction analysis revealed that Ae. albopictus lncRNAs may regulate the expression of genes involved in immunity and other metabolic and cellular processes. To verify the role of lncRNAs in virus infection, we generated mutation in lncRNA loci using CRISPR-Cas9, and discovered that two lncRNA loci mutations, namely XLOC_029733 (novel lncRNA transcript id: lncRNA_27639.2) and LOC115270134 (known lncRNA transcript id: XR_003899061.1) resulted in enhancement of DENV and ZIKV replication. The results presented here provide an important foundation for future studies of lncRNAs and their relationship with virus infection in Ae. albopictus. Author summary Ae. albopictus is an important vector of arboviruses such as dengue and Zika. Studies on virus-host interaction at gene expression and molecular level are crucial especially in devising methods to inhibit virus replication in Aedes mosquito. Previous reports showed that, besides protein-coding genes, noncoding RNAs such as lncRNAs are also involved in virus-host interaction. In this study, we report a comprehensive catalog of novel lncRNA transcripts in the genome of Ae. albopictus. We also show that the expression of lncRNAs was altered upon infection with dengue and Zika. Additionally, depletion of certain lncRNAs resulted in increased replication of dengue and Zika; hence, suggesting potential association of lncRNAs in virus infection. Results of this study provide a new avenue to the investigation of mosquito-virus interactions that may potentially pave way to the development of novel methods in vector control.

TI  - Genome-wide screens in accelerated human stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells identify Zika virus host factors and drivers of proliferation
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are essential to brain development and their dysfunction is linked to several disorders, including autism, Zika Virus Congenital Syndrome, and cancer. Understanding of these conditions has been improved by advancements with stem cell-derived NPC models. However, current differentiation methods require many days or weeks to generate NPCs and show variability in efficacy among cell lines. Here, we describe human Stem cell-derived NGN2-accelerated Progenitor cells (SNaPs), which are produced in only 48 hours. SNaPs express canonical forebrain NPC protein markers, are proliferative, multipotent, and like other human NPCs, are susceptible to Zika-mediated death. We further demonstrate SNaPs are valuable for large-scale investigations of genetic and environmental influencers of neurodevelopment by deploying them for genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Our studies expand knowledge of NPCs by identifying known and novel Zika host factors, as well as new regulators of NPC proliferation validated by re-identification of the autism spectrum gene PTEN.

AB  - The geographical range of Zika virus (ZIKV) has expanded dramatically in recent decades, but no antiviral drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment or prevention of ZIKV infection. Here we map host cell protein interactions for each of the ten ZIKV polypeptides, generating a protein network comprising >3000 interactions. Mining this rich dataset, we highlight multiple examples of how ZIKV may usurp or disrupt the function of host organelles and uncover an important role for peroxisomes in ZIKV infection. Graphical Abstract Highlights BioID and IP-MS were conducted to generate a global ZIKV-host protein interactome Interactome consists of >3000 high confidence ZIKV-host protein interactions Data mining indicates that ZIKV proteins interact with multiple host cell organelles An important role for peroxisomes in ZIKV infection is uncovered Zika virus (ZIKV) is a membrane enveloped Flavivirus with a positive strand RNA genome, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. The geographical range of ZIKV has dramatically expanded in recent decades resulting in increasing numbers of infected individuals, and the spike in ZIKV infections has been linked to significant increases in both Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly. Although a large number of host proteins have been physically and/or functionally linked to other Flaviviruses, very little is known about the virus-host protein interactions established by ZIKV. Here we map host cell protein interaction profiles for each of the ten polypeptides encoded in the ZIKV genome, generating a protein topology network comprising 3033 interactions among 1224 unique human polypeptides. The interactome is enriched in proteins with roles in polypeptide processing and quality control, vesicle trafficking, RNA processing and lipid metabolism. >60% of the network components have been previously implicated in other types of viral infections; the remaining interactors comprise hundreds of new putative ZIKV functional partners. Mining this rich data set, we highlight several examples of how ZIKV may usurp or disrupt the function of host cell organelles, and uncover an important role for peroxisomes in ZIKV infection.

TI  - Glucose-Regulated Protein 78 Interacts with Zika Virus Envelope Protein and Contributes to a Productive Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV; Flaviviridae) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus shown to cause fetal abnormalities collectively known as congenital Zika syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome in recent outbreaks. Currently, there is no specific treatment or vaccine available, and more effort is needed to identify cellular factors in the viral life cycle. Here, we investigated interactors of ZIKV envelope (E) protein by combining protein pull-down with mass spectrometry. We found that E interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident chaperone, glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78). Although other flaviviruses are known to co-opt ER resident proteins, including GRP78, to enhance viral infectivity, the role ER proteins play during the ZIKV life cycle is yet to be elucidated. We showed that GRP78 levels increased during ZIKV infection and localised to sites coincident with ZIKV E staining. Depletion of GRP78 using specific siRNAs significantly reduced reporter-virus luciferase readings, viral protein synthesis, and viral titres. Additionally, GRP78 depletion reduced the ability of ZIKV to disrupt host cell translation and altered the localisation of viral replication factories, though there was no effect on viral RNA synthesis. In summary, we showed GRP78 is a vital host-factor during ZIKV infection, which may be involved in the coordination of viral replication factories.

TI  - Glutathionylation of dengue and Zika NS5 proteins affects guanylyltransferase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase activities
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 13
AB  - It has been estimated for dengue infection that the global population at risk is 3.5 billion people, which makes dengue an important public health problem. The causative agents of dengue are dengue viruses. For dengue virus replication, the dengue virus NS5 protein is of special importance as it has several enzyme activities important for viral replication. Previous reports of phosphorylation and SUMOylation of dengue NS5 have shown these protein modifications have important consequences for NS5 functions. In this report we identify glutathionylation, another reversible post translation modification that impacts on NS5 enzyme activity. Using dengue virus infected cells we employed specific antibodies and mass spectrometry to identify 3 cysteine residues of NS5 protein as being glutathionylated. Glutathionylation is a post translational protein modification where glutathione is covalently attached to a cysteine residue. We showed glutathionylation occurs on 3 conserved cysteine residues of dengue NS5. Then we generated two flavivirus recombinant full length proteins, dengue NS5 and Zika NS5, to characterize two of the NS5 enzyme activities, namely, guanylyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities. We show glutathionylation of dengue and Zika NS5 affects enzyme activities of the two flavivirus proteins. The data suggests that glutathionylation is a general feature of the flavivirus NS5 protein and the modification has the potential to modulate several of the NS5 enzyme functions.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an enveloped RNA virus from the flavivirus family that can cause fetal neural abnormalities in pregnant women. Previously, we established that ZIKV-EP (envelope protein) binds to human placental chondroitin sulfate (CS), suggesting that CS may be a potential host cell surface receptor in ZIKV pathogenesis. In this study, we further characterized the GAG disaccharide composition of other biological tissues (i.e., mosquitoes, fetal brain cells, and eye tissues) in ZIKV pathogenesis to investigate the role of tissue specific GAGs. Heparan sulfate (HS) was the major GAG, and levels of HS-6-sulfo, HS 0S (unsulfated HS), and CS 4S disaccharides were the main differences in the GAG composition of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. In human fetal neural progenitor and differentiated cells, HS 0S and CS 4S were the main disaccharides. A change in disaccharide composition levels was observed between undifferentiated and differentiated cells. In different regions of the bovine eyes, CS was the major GAG, and the amounts of hyaluronic acid or keratan sulfate varied depending on the region of the eye. Next, we examined heparin (HP) of various structures to investigate their potential in vitro antiviral activity against ZIKV and Dengue virus (DENV) infection in Vero cells. All compounds effectively inhibited DENV replication; however, they surprisingly promoted ZIKV replication. HP of longer chain lengths more strongly promoted activity in ZIKV replication. This study further expands our understanding of role of GAGs in ZIKV pathogenesis and carbohydrate-based antivirals against flaviviral infection.

AB  - ABSTRACT Glycans are among the most important cell molecular components. However, given their structural diversity, their functions have not been fully explored. Glycosylation is a vital post-translational modification for various proteins. Many bacteria and viruses rely on N-linked and O-linked glycosylation to perform critical biological functions. The diverse functions of glycosylation on viral proteins during viral infections, including Dengue, Zika, influenza, and human immunodeficiency viruses as well as coronaviruses have been reported. N-linked glycosylation is the most common form of protein modification, and it modulates folding, transportation and receptor binding. Compared to N-linked glycosylation, the functions of O-linked viral protein glycosylation have not been comprehensively evaluated. In this review, we summarize findings on viral protein glycosylation, with particular attention to studies on N-linked glycosylation in viral life cycles. This review informs the development of virus-specific vaccines or inhibitors.

TI  - Glycosylation of Zika Virus is Important in Host–Virus Interaction and Pathogenic Potential
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 20
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a global public health issue due to its association with severe developmental disorders in infants and neurological disorders in adults. ZIKV uses glycosylation of its envelope (E) protein to interact with host cell receptors to facilitate entry; these interactions could also be important for designing therapeutics and vaccines. Due to a lack of proper information about Asn-linked (N-glycans) on ZIKV E, we analyzed ZIKV E of various strains derived from different cells. We found ZIKV E proteins being extensively modified with oligomannose, hybrid and complex N-glycans of a highly heterogeneous nature. Host cell surface glycans correlated strongly with the glycomic features of ZIKV E. Mechanistically, we observed that ZIKV N-glycans might play a role in viral pathogenesis, as mannose-specific C-type lectins DC-SIGN and L-SIGN mediate host cell entry of ZIKV. Our findings represent the first detailed mapping of N-glycans on ZIKV E of various strains and their functional significance.

TI  - Growth and adaptation of Zika virus in mammalian and mosquito cells
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 12
AB  - The recent emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas coincident with increased caseloads of microcephalic infants and Guillain-Barre syndrome has prompted a flurry of research on ZIKV. Much of the research is difficult to compare or repeat because individual laboratories use different virus isolates, growth conditions, and quantitative assays. Here we obtained three readily available contemporary ZIKV isolates and the prototype Ugandan isolate. We generated stocks of each on Vero mammalian cells (ZIKVmam) and C6/36 mosquito cells (ZIKVmos), determined titers by different assays side-by-side, compared growth characteristics using one-step and multi-step growth curves on Vero and C6/36 cells, and examined plaque phenotype. ZIKV titers consistently peaked earlier on Vero cells than on C6/36 cells. Contemporary ZIKV isolates reached peak titer most quickly in a multi-step growth curve when the amplifying cell line was the same as the titering cell line (e.g., ZIKVmam titered on Vero cells). Growth of ZIKVmam on mosquito cells was particularly delayed. These data suggest that the ability to infect and/or replicate in insect cells is limited after growth in mammalian cells. In addition, ZIKVmos typically had smaller, more homogenous plaques than ZIKVmam in a standard plaque assay. We hypothesized that the plaque size difference represented early adaptation to growth in mammalian cells. We plaque purified representative-sized plaques from ZIKVmos and ZIKVmam. ZIKVmos isolates maintained the initial phenotype while plaques from ZIKVmam isolates became larger with passaging. Our results underscore the importance of the cells used to produce viral stocks and the potential for adaptation with minimal cell passages. In addition, these studies provide a foundation to compare current and emerging ZIKV isolates in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - Gut symbiont-derived sphingosine modulates vector competence in Aedes mosquitoes
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 15
AB  - The main vectors of Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, with Ae. aegypti being more competent. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we find Ae. albopictus shows comparable vector competence to ZIKV/DENV with Ae. aegypti by blood-feeding after antibiotic treatment or intrathoracic injection. This suggests that midgut microbiota can influence vector competence. Enterobacter hormaechei_B17 (Eh_B17) is isolated from field-collected Ae. albopictus and conferred resistance to ZIKV/DENV infection in Ae. aegypti after gut-transplantation. Sphingosine, a metabolite secreted by Eh_B17, effectively suppresses ZIKV infection in both Ae. aegypti and cell cultures by blocking viral entry during the fusion step, with an IC50 of approximately 10 μM. A field survey reveals that Eh_B17 preferentially colonizes Ae. albopictus compared to Ae. aegypti. And field Ae. albopictus positive for Eh_B17 are more resistant to ZIKV infection. These findings underscore the potential of gut symbiotic bacteria, such as Eh_B17, to modulate the arbovirus vector competence of Aedes mosquitoes. As a natural antiviral agent, Eh_B17 holds promise as a potential candidate for blocking ZIKV/DENV transmission.

JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 8
SP  - 8

AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is a historically neglected mosquito-borne flavivirus that has caused recent epidemics in the western hemisphere. ZIKV has been associated with severe symptoms including infant microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, stimulating interest in understanding factors governing ZIKV infection. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) has been shown to be an infection factor for multiple viruses, leading us to investigate the role of Hsp70 in the ZIKV infection process. ZIKV infection induced Hsp70 expression in host cells 48-h post-infection. Inducing Hsp70 expression in mammalian cells increased ZIKV production, whereas inhibiting Hsp70 activity reduced ZIKV viral RNA production and virion release from the cell. Hsp70 was localized both on the cell surface where it could interact with ZIKV during the initial stages of the infection process, and intracellularly where it localized with viral RNA. Blocking cell surface-localized Hsp70 using antibodies decreased ZIKV cell infection rates and production of infectious virus particles, as did competition with recombinant Hsp70 protein. Overall, Hsp70 was found to play a functional role in both the pre- and post-ZIKV infection processes affecting viral entry, replication, and egress. Understanding the interactions between Hsp70 and ZIKV may lead to novel therapeutics for ZIKV infection.

TI  - Heparin Precursors with Reduced Anticoagulant Properties Retain Antiviral and Protective Effects That Potentiate the Efficacy of Sofosbuvir against Zika Virus Infection in Human Neural Progenitor Cells
JF  - Pharmaceuticals
VL  - 16
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy can result in severe birth defects, such as microcephaly, as well as a range of other related health complications. Heparin, a clinical-grade anticoagulant, is shown to protect neural progenitor cells from death following ZIKV infection. Although heparin can be safely used during pregnancy, it retains off-target anticoagulant effects if directly employed against ZIKV infection. In this study, we investigated the effects of chemically modified heparin derivatives with reduced anticoagulant activities. These derivatives were used as experimental probes to explore the structure–activity relationships. Precursor fractions of porcine heparin, obtained during the manufacture of conventional pharmaceutical heparin with decreased anticoagulant activities, were also explored. Interestingly, these modified heparin derivatives and precursor fractions not only prevented cell death but also inhibited the ZIKV replication of infected neural progenitor cells grown as neurospheres. These effects were observed regardless of the specific sulfation position or overall charge. Furthermore, the combination of heparin with Sofosbuvir, an antiviral licensed for the treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) that also belongs to the same Flaviviridae family as ZIKV, showed a synergistic effect. This suggested that a combination therapy approach involving heparin precursors and Sofosbuvir could be a potential strategy for the prevention or treatment of ZIKV infections.

TI  - Heparin Protects Human Neural Progenitor Cells from Zika Virus-Induced Cell Death While Preserving Their Differentiation into Mature Neuroglial Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - ZIKV is a neurotropic virus that invades neural progenitor cells (NPCs), causing inhibition of their proliferation and maturation into neurons and glial cells. We have shown previously that heparin, an anticoagulant also used widely during pregnancy, prevents ZIKV-induced cell death with negligible inhibition of virus replication. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus member of the Flaviviridae family that causes severe congenital brain anomalies in infected fetuses. The key target cells of ZIKV infection, human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), are highly permissive to infection that causes the inhibition of cell proliferation and induces cell death. We have previously shown that pharmaceutical-grade heparin inhibits virus-induced cell death with negligible effects on in vitro virus replication in ZIKV-infected hNPCs at the “high” multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Here, we show that heparin inhibits formation of ZIKV-induced intracellular vacuoles, a signature of paraptosis, and inhibits necrosis and apoptosis of hNPCs grown as neurospheres (NS). To test whether heparin preserved the differentiation of ZIKV-infected hNPCs into neuroglial cells, hNPCs were infected at the MOI of 0.001. In this experimental condition, heparin inhibited ZIKV replication by ca. 2 log10, mostly interfering with virion attachment, while maintaining its protective effect against ZIKV-induced cytopathicity. Heparin preserved differentiation into neuroglial cells of hNPCs that were obtained from either human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) or by fetal tissue. Quite surprisingly, multiple additions of heparin to hNPCs enabled prolonged virus replication while preventing virus-induced cytopathicity. Collectively, these results highlight the potential neuroprotective effect of heparin that could serve as a lead compound to develop novel agents for preventing the damage of ZIKV infection on the developing brain. IMPORTANCE ZIKV is a neurotropic virus that invades neural progenitor cells (NPCs), causing inhibition of their proliferation and maturation into neurons and glial cells. We have shown previously that heparin, an anticoagulant also used widely during pregnancy, prevents ZIKV-induced cell death with negligible inhibition of virus replication. Here, we demonstrate that heparin also exerts antiviral activity against ZIKV replication using a much lower infectious inoculum. Moreover, heparin interferes with different modalities of virus-induced cell death. Finally, heparin-induced prevention of virus-induced NPC death allows their differentiation into neuroglial cells despite the intracellular accumulation of virions. These results highlight the potential use of heparin, or pharmacological agents derived from it, in pregnant women to prevent the devastating effects of ZIKV infection on the developing brain of their fetuses.

TI  - Hide and Seek: The Interplay Between Zika Virus and the Host Immune Response
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) received worldwide attention over the past decade when outbreaks of the disease were found to be associated with severe neurological syndromes and congenital abnormalities. Unlike most other flaviviruses, ZIKV can spread through sexual and transplacental transmission, adding to the complexity of Zika pathogenesis and clinical outcomes. In addition, the spread of ZIKV in flavivirus-endemic regions, and the high degree of structural and sequence homology between Zika and its close cousin Dengue have raised questions on the interplay between ZIKV and the pre-existing immunity to other flaviviruses and the potential immunopathogenesis. The Zika epidemic peaked in 2016 and has affected over 80 countries worldwide. The re-emergence of large-scale outbreaks in the future is certainly a possibility. To date, there has been no approved antiviral or vaccine against the ZIKV. Therefore, continuing Zika research and developing an effective antiviral and vaccine is essential to prepare the world for a future Zika epidemic. For this purpose, an in-depth understanding of ZIKV interaction with many different pathways in the human host and how it exploits the host immune response is required. For successful infection, the virus has developed elaborate mechanisms to escape the host response, including blocking host interferon response and shutdown of certain host cell translation. This review provides a summary on the key host factors that facilitate ZIKV entry and replication and the mechanisms by which ZIKV antagonizes antiviral innate immune response and involvement of adaptive immune response leading to immunopathology. We also discuss how ZIKV modulates the host immune response during sexual transmission and pregnancy to induce infection, how the cross-reactive immunity from other flaviviruses impacts ZIKV infection, and provide an update on the current status of ZIKV vaccine development.

TI  - High Glucose Induces in HK2 Kidney Cells an IFN–Dependent ZIKV Antiviral Status Fueled by Viperin
JF  - Biomedicines
VL  - 10
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that rapidly became a major medical concern worldwide. We have recently reported that a high glucose level decreases the rate of Zika virus (ZIKV) replication with an impact on human kidney HK-2 cell survival. However, the mechanisms by which cells cultured in a high glucose medium inhibit ZIKV growth remain unclear. Viperin belongs to interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) and its expression is highly up-regulated upon viral infection, leading to antiviral activity against a variety of viruses, including flaviviruses. As such, viperin has been shown to be a major actor involved in the innate immune response against Zika virus (ZIKV). Our present study aims to further characterize the involvement of viperin in ZIKV growth inhibition under high glucose concentration (HK-2HGC). We show for the first time that endogenous viperin is over-expressed in HK-2 cells cultured under high glucose concentration (HK-2HGC), which is associated with ZIKV growth inhibition. Viperin knockdown in HK-2HGC rescues ZIKV growth. In addition, our results emphasize that up-regulated viperin in HK-2HGC leads to ZIKV growth inhibition through the stimulation of IFN-β production. In summary, our work provides new insights into the ZIKV growth inhibition mechanism observed in HK-2 cells cultured in a high glucose environment.

TI  - High-Throughput Screening Identifies Mixed-Lineage Kinase 3 as a Key Host Regulatory Factor in Zika Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - Zika fever, an infectious disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV), normally results in mild symptoms. Severe infection can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults and birth defects, including microcephaly, in newborns. Although ZIKV was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys, a widespread epidemic of ZIKV infection in South and Central America in 2015 and 2016 raised major concerns. To date, there is no vaccine or specific medicine for ZIKV. The significance of our research is the systematic discovery of small molecule candidates that modulate ZIKV infection, which will allow the development of antiviral therapeutics. In addition, we identified MLK3, a key mediator of host signaling pathways that can be activated during ZIKV infection and limits virus replication by inducing multiple inflammatory cytokines. These findings broaden our understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis. ABSTRACT The Zika virus (ZIKV) life cycle involves multiple steps and requires interactions with host factors. However, the inability to systematically identify host regulatory factors for ZIKV has hampered antiviral development and our understanding of pathogenicity. Here, using a bioactive compound library with 2,659 small molecules, we applied a high-throughput and imaging-based screen to identify host factors that modulate ZIKV infection. The screen yielded hundreds of hits that markedly inhibited or potentiated ZIKV infection in SNB-19 glioblastoma cells. Among the hits, URMC-099, a mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) inhibitor, significantly facilitated ZIKV replication in both SNB-19 cells and the neonatal mouse brain. Using gene silencing and overexpression, we further confirmed that MLK3 was a host restriction factor against ZIKV. Mechanistically, MLK3 negatively regulated ZIKV replication through induction of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) but did not modulate host interferon-related pathways. Importantly, ZIKV activated the MLK3/MKK7/Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) pathway in both SNB-19 cells and neonatal mouse brain. Together, these findings reveal a critical role for MLK3 in regulating ZIKV infection and facilitate the development of anti-ZIKV therapeutics by providing a number of screening hits. IMPORTANCE Zika fever, an infectious disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV), normally results in mild symptoms. Severe infection can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults and birth defects, including microcephaly, in newborns.

TI  - Hijacking of Lipid Droplets by Hepatitis C, Dengue and Zika Viruses—From Viral Protein Moonlighting to Extracellular Release
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 21
AB  - Hijacking and manipulation of host cell biosynthetic pathways by human enveloped viruses are essential for the viral lifecycle. Flaviviridae members, including hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses, extensively manipulate host lipid metabolism, underlining the importance of lipid droplets (LDs) in viral infection. LDs are dynamic cytoplasmic organelles that can act as sequestration platforms for a unique subset of host and viral proteins. Transient recruitment and mobilization of proteins to LDs during viral infection impacts host-cell biological properties, LD functionality and canonical protein functions. Notably, recent studies identified LDs in the nucleus and also identified that LDs are transported extracellularly via an autophagy-mediated mechanism, indicating a novel role for autophagy in Flaviviridae infections. These developments underline an unsuspected diversity and localization of LDs and potential moonlighting functions of LD-associated proteins during infection. This review summarizes recent breakthroughs concerning the LD hijacking activities of hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses and potential roles of cytoplasmic, nuclear and extracellular LD-associated viral proteins during infection.

TI  - HLA-A, HSPA5, IGFBP5 and PSMA2 Are Restriction Factors for Zika Virus Growth in Astrocytic Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - (1) Background: Zika virus (ZIKV), an arbo-flavivirus, is transmitted via Aeges aegyptii mosquitoes Following its major outbreaks in 2013, 2014 and 2016, WHO declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Symptoms of ZIKV infection include acute fever, conjunctivitis, headache, muscle & joint pain and malaise. Cases of its transmission also have been reported via perinatal, sexual and transfusion transmission. ZIKV pathologies include meningo-encephalitis and myelitis in the central nervous system (CNS) and Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute transient polyneuritis in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Drugs like azithromycin have been tested as inhibitors of ZIKV infection but no vaccines or treatments are currently available. Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the CNS and among the first cells in CNS infected by ZIKV; (2) Methods: We previously used SOMAScan proteomics to study ZIKV-infected astrocytic cells. Here, we use mass spectrometric analyses to further explain dysregulations in the cellular expression profile of glioblastoma astrocytoma U251 cells. We also knocked down (KD) some of the U251 cellular proteins using siRNAs and observed the impact on ZIKV replication and infectivity; (3) Results & Conclusions: The top ZIKV dysregulated cellular networks were antimicrobial response, cell death, and energy production while top dysregulated functions were antigen presentation, viral replication and cytopathic impact. Th1 and interferon signaling pathways were among the top dysregulated canonical pathways. siRNA-mediated KD of HLA-A, IGFBP5, PSMA2 and HSPA5 increased ZIKV titers and protein synthesis, indicating they are ZIKV restriction factors. ZIKV infection also restored HLA-A expression in HLA-A KD cells by 48 h post-infection, suggesting interactions between this gene product and ZIKV.

AB  - ABSTRACT In 2015–2016, in the Americas, and especially in northeast Brazil, a significant number of cases of microcephaly and other congenital brain abnormalities were linked with an outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women. While maternal symptoms of ZIKV are generally mild and self-limiting, clinical presentation in fetuses and newborns infected is extensive and includes microcephaly, decreased cortical development, atrophy and hypoplasia of the cerebellum and cerebellar vermis, arthrogryposis, and polyhydramnios. The term congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS) was introduced to describe the range of findings associated with maternal-fetal ZIKV transmission. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, however non-vector-dependent routes are also possible. Mechanisms of maternal-fetal transmission remain unknown, and the trans-placental route has been extensively studied in animal models and in human samples. The aim of this review was to summarize recent studies that helped to elucidate the mechanism of CZS in animal models and observational studies. There are still challenges in the diagnosis and prevention of CZS in humans, due to the large gap that remains in translating ZIKV research to clinical practice. Translational research linking governments, local health workers, scientists and industry is fundamental to improve care for mothers and children.

TI  - Host Cell Targets for Unconventional Antivirals against RNA Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - The recent COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the importance of RNA-based viruses. The most prominent members of this group are SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus), HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), EBOV (Ebola virus), DENV (dengue virus), HCV (hepatitis C virus), ZIKV (Zika virus), CHIKV (chikungunya virus), and influenza A virus. With the exception of retroviruses which produce reverse transcriptase, the majority of RNA viruses encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerases which do not include molecular proofreading tools, underlying the high mutation capacity of these viruses as they multiply in the host cells. Together with their ability to manipulate the immune system of the host in different ways, their high mutation frequency poses a challenge to develop effective and durable vaccination and/or treatments. Consequently, the use of antiviral targeting agents, while an important part of the therapeutic strategy against infection, may lead to the selection of drug-resistant variants. The crucial role of the host cell replicative and processing machinery is essential for the replicative cycle of the viruses and has driven attention to the potential use of drugs directed to the host machinery as therapeutic alternatives to treat viral infections. In this review, we discuss small molecules with antiviral effects that target cellular factors in different steps of the infectious cycle of many RNA viruses. We emphasize the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs with broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Finally, we postulate that the ferruginol analog (18-(phthalimide-2-yl) ferruginol) is a potential host-targeted antiviral.

TI  - Host Cell‐Zika Virus Interaction Determined by Envelope Protein Structure
JF  - The FASEB Journal
VL  - 31
AB  - Zika is a flavivirus similar to dengue and West Nile viruses. The Zika virus was first isolated in the Zika forest in Uganda in 1947. Rapid proliferation of Zika can be attributed to a lack of immunity and its unique protein structure. Once the virus enters the host cell, a change in pH causes a conformational change of the envelope (E) protein which releases the viral RNA into the cell. The E protein is a dimer in which each monomer is composed of three domains. Domain I contains a potential glycosylation site, an asparagine amino acid, at position 154. The sugar at this site may serve to bind the virus to host cells. In addition, glycosylation at this site may control the amount of solvent able to access the fusion loop in Domain II, affecting the wide array of cells the virus can infect. The five amino acids around the glycosylation site unique to Zika may also affect the virus's sensitivity to antibodies that bind the fusion loop. Because of Zika's mass proliferation and potential to cause birth defects, it has become a global health priority. An understanding of Zika structure and function may lead to development of vaccines targeting E proteins. The Marshfield High School SMART team 3D‐printed the ZIKV E protein highlighting the glycosylation site of Domain I to illustrate the host cell binding mechanism.

TI  - Host cytoskeletal vimentin serves as a structural organizer and an RNA-binding protein regulator to facilitate Zika viral replication
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 119
AB  - Significance We discovered a dual role of vimentin underlying Zika virus (ZIKV) replication. The vimentin network reorganizes to surround the replication complex. Depletion of vimentin resulted in drastic segregation of viral proteins and subsequent defective infection, indicating its function as an “organizer” that ensures the concentration of all necessary factors for high replication efficacy. With omics analysis, we prove that vimentin also functions as a “regulator” that dominates RNA-binding proteins during infection. These two roles complement one another to make an integrated view of vimentin in regulating ZIKV infection. Collectively, our study fills the long-term gap in our knowledge of the cellular function of intermediate filaments in addition to structural support and provides a potential target for ZIKV therapy. Emerging microbe infections, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), pose an increasing threat to human health. Investigations on ZIKV replication have revealed the construction of replication complexes (RCs), but the role of cytoskeleton in this process is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the function of cytoskeletal intermediate filament protein vimentin in the life cycle of ZIKV infection. Using advanced imaging techniques, we uncovered that vimentin filaments undergo drastic reorganization upon viral protein synthesis to form a perinuclear cage-like structure that embraces and concentrates RCs. Genetic removal of vimentin markedly disrupted the integrity of RCs and resulted in fragmented subcellular dispersion of viral proteins. This led to reduced viral genome replication, viral protein production, and release of infectious virions, without interrupting viral binding and entry. Furthermore, mass spectrometry and RNA-sequencing screens identified interactions and interplay between vimentin and hundreds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident RNA-binding proteins. Among them, the cytoplasmic-region of ribosome receptor binding protein 1, an ER transmembrane protein that directly binds viral RNA, interacted with and was regulated by vimentin, resulting in modulation of ZIKV replication. Together, the data in our work reveal a dual role for vimentin as a structural element for RC integrity and as an RNA-binding-regulating hub during ZIKV infection, thus unveiling a layer of interplay between Zika virus and host cell.

TI  - Host immune response against DENV and ZIKV infections
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue is a major public health concern, affecting almost 400 million people worldwide, with about 70% of the global burden of disease in Asia. Despite revised clinical classifications of dengue infections by the World Health Organization, the wide spectrum of the manifestations of dengue illness continues to pose challenges in diagnosis and patient management for clinicians. When the Zika epidemic spread through the American continent and then later to Africa and Asia in 2015, researchers compared the characteristics of the Zika infection to Dengue, considering both these viruses were transmitted primarily through the same vector, the Aedes aegypti female mosquitoes. An important difference to note, however, was that the Zika epidemic diffused in a shorter time span compared to the persisting feature of Dengue infections, which is endemic in many Asian countries. As the pathogenesis of viral illnesses is affected by host immune responses, various immune modulators have been proposed as biomarkers to predict the risk of the disease progression to a severe form, at a much earlier stage of the illness. However, the findings for most biomarkers are highly discrepant between studies. Meanwhile, the cross-reactivity of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells response to Dengue and Zika viruses provide important clues for further development of potential treatments. This review discusses similarities between Dengue and Zika infections, comparing their disease transmissions and vectors involved, and both the innate and adaptive immune responses in these infections. Consideration of the genetic identity of both the Dengue and Zika flaviviruses as well as the cross-reactivity of relevant T cells along with the actions of CD4+ cytotoxic cells in these infections are also presented. Finally, a summary of the immune biomarkers that have been reported for dengue and Zika viral infections are discussed which may be useful indicators for future anti-viral targets or predictors for disease severity. Together, this information appraises the current understanding of both Zika and Dengue infections, providing insights for future vaccine design approaches against both viruses.

TI  - Host Molecules Regulating Neural Invasion of Zika Virus and Drug Repurposing Strategy
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus. Although ZIKV infection is usually known to exhibit mild clinical symptoms, intrauterine ZIKV infections have been associated with severe neurological manifestations, including microcephaly and Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS). Therefore, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms of ZIKV entry into the central nervous system (CNS) and its effect on brain cells. Several routes of neuro-invasion have been identified, among which blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption is the commonest mode of access. The molecular receptors involved in viral entry remain unknown; with various proposed molecular ZIKV-host interactions including potential non-receptor mediated cellular entry. As ZIKV invade neuronal cells, they trigger neurotoxic mechanisms via cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous pathways, resulting in neurogenesis dysfunction, viral replication, and cell death, all of which eventually lead to microcephaly. Together, our understanding of the biological mechanisms of ZIKV exposure would aid in the development of anti-ZIKV therapies targeting host cellular and/or viral components to combat ZIKV infection and its neurological manifestations. In this present work, we review the current understanding of ZIKV entry mechanisms into the CNS and its implications on the brain. We also highlight the status of the drug repurposing approach for the development of potential antiviral drugs against ZIKV.

EP  - 17
AB  - Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) proteomic analyses have revealed that host proteins are often captured in extracellular virions. These proteins may play a role in viral replication or infectivity and can represent targets for broad-spectrum antiviral agent development. We utilized LCMS to determine the host protein composition of Lassa virus-like particles (LASV VLPs). Multiple host proteins incorporated in LASV VLPs are also incorporated in unrelated viruses, notably ribosomal proteins. We assembled a data set of host proteins incorporated into extracellular viral particles. The frequent incorporation of specific host proteins into viruses of diverse families suggests that interactions of these proteins with viral factors may be important for effective viral replication. Drugs that target virion-associated host proteins could affect the protein in the extracellular virion or the host cell. Compounds that target proteins incorporated into virions with high frequency, but with no known antiviral activity, were assayed in a scalable viral screening platform, and hits were tested in competent viral systems. One of these molecules, GAPDH modulating small molecule CGP 3466B maleate (Omigapil), exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of HIV, dengue virus, and Zika virus.

TI  - Host upregulation of lipid droplets drives antiviral responses
JF  - Cell Stress
VL  - 5
SP  - 143
EP  - 145
AB  - When a host cell is infected by a virus, it activates the innate immune response, setting off a cascade of signalling events leading to the production of an antiviral response. This immune response is typically robust and in general works well to clear viral infections, however, viruses have evolved evasion strategies to combat this, and therefore, a better understanding of how this response works in more detail is needed for the development of novel and effective therapeutics. Lipid droplets (LDs) are intracellular organelles and have historically been thought of simply as cellular energy sources, however, have more recently been recognised as critical organelles in signalling events. Importantly, many viruses are known to take over host cellular production of LDs, and it has traditionally been assumed the sole purpose of this is to supply energy for viral life cycle events. However, our recent work positions LDs as important organelles during the first few hours of an antiviral response, showing that they underpin the production of important antiviral cytokines following viral infection. Following infection of cells with either RNA viruses (Zika, Dengue, Influenza A) or a DNA (Herpes Simplex Virus-1) virus, LDs were rapidly upregulated, and this response was also replicated following stimulation with viral mimic agonists. This upregulation of LDs following infection was transient, and interestingly, did not follow the well described homeostatic mechanism of LD upregulation, instead being controlled by EGFR. The cell's ability to mount an effective immune response was greatly diminished when inhibiting EGFR, thus inhibiting LD upregulation during infection, also leading to an increase in viral replication. In this microreview, we extrapolate our recent findings and discuss LDs as an important organelle in the innate immune response.

TI  - Host-Directed Antivirals: A Realistic Alternative to Fight Zika Virus
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 10
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, was an almost neglected pathogen until its introduction in the Americas in 2015, where it has been responsible for a threat to global health, causing a great social and sanitary alarm due to its increased virulence, rapid spread, and an association with severe neurological and ophthalmological complications. Currently, no specific antiviral therapy against ZIKV is available, and treatments are palliative and mainly directed toward the relief of symptoms, such as fever and rash, by administering antipyretics, anti-histamines, and fluids for dehydration. Nevertheless, lately, search for antivirals has been a major aim in ZIKV investigations. To do so, screening of libraries from different sources, testing of natural compounds, and repurposing of drugs with known antiviral activity have allowed the identification of several antiviral candidates directed to both viral (structural proteins and enzymes) and cellular elements. Here, we present an updated review of current knowledge about anti-ZIKV strategies, focusing on host-directed antivirals as a realistic alternative to combat ZIKV infection.

TI  - Host-Viral Interactions at the Maternal-Fetal Interface. What We Know and What We Need to Know
JF  - Frontiers
VL  - 2
AB  - In humans, the hemochorial placenta is a unique temporary organ that forms during pregnancy to support fetal development, gaseous exchange, delivery of nutrition, removal of waste products, and provides immune protection, while maintaining tolerance to the HLA-haploidentical fetus. In this review, we characterize decidual and placental immunity during maternal viral (co)-infection with HIV-1, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and Zika virus. We discuss placental immunology, clinical presentation, and epidemiology, before characterizing host susceptibility and cellular tropism, and how the three viruses gain access into specific placental target cells. We describe current knowledge on host-viral interactions with decidual and stromal human placental macrophages or Hofbauer cells, trophoblasts including extra villous trophoblasts, T cells, and decidual natural killer (dNK) cells. These clinically significant viral infections elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses to control replication. However, the three viruses either during mono- or co-infection (HIV-1 and HCMV) escape detection to initiate placental inflammation associated with viral transmission to the developing fetus. Aside from congenital or perinatal infection, other adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm labor and spontaneous abortion. In addition, maternal HIV-1 and HCMV co-infection are associated with impaired fetal and infant immunity in postnatal life and poor clinical outcomes during childhood in exposed infants, even in the absence of vertical transmission of HIV-1. Given the rapidly expanding numbers of HIV-1-exposed uninfected infants and children globally, further research is urgently needed on neonatal immune programming during maternal mono-and co-infection. This review therefore includes sections on current knowledge gaps that may prompt future research directions. These gaps reflect an emerging but poorly characterized field. Their significance and potential investigation is underscored by the fact that although viral infections result in adverse consequences in both mother and developing fetus/newborn, antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies can improve clinical outcomes in the dyad.

TI  - Hsa_circ_0007321 regulates Zika virus replication through miR-492/NFKBID/NF-κB signaling pathway
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 97
AB  - ABSTRACT Circular RNAs (CircRNAs) have been shown to play a critical role in regulating viral infection and replication. We performed RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells with and without Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Notably, hsa_circ_0007321 was significantly downregulated after ZIKV infection. We then explored the role and mechanism of hsa_circ_0007321 in the regulation of ZIKV replication. Hsa_circ_0007321, derived from exons 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the DIS3L2 (DIS3 like 3'−5' exoribonuclease 2) gene, was mainly enriched in cytoplasm. We found that the knockdown of hsa_circ_0007321 significantly increased microRNA-492 levels to decrease NFKBID (NFKB inhibitor delta) expression, leading to the activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, inflammatory cytokine production, and subsequently, inhibition of ZIKV replication. These findings illustrate that hsa_circ_0007321 acts as a competitive endogenous RNA that regulates ZIKV replication through the miR-492/NFKBID NF-κB signaling pathway. IMPORTANCE Over the past decade, increasing evidence has shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important regulatory roles in viral infection and host antiviral responses. However, reports on the role of circRNAs in Zika virus (ZIKV) infection are limited. In this study, we identified 45 differentially expressed circRNAs in ZIKV-infected A549 cells by RNA sequencing. We clarified that a downregulated circRNA, hsa_circ_0007321, regulates ZIKV replication through targeting of miR-492 and the downstream gene NFKBID. NFKBID is a negative regulator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and we found that inhibition of the NF-κB pathway promotes ZIKV replication. Therefore, this finding that hsa_circ_0007321 exerts its regulatory role on ZIKV replication through the miR-492/NFKBID/NF-κB signaling pathway has implications for the development of strategies to suppress ZIKV and possibly other viral infections.

TI  - Human DDX3X Unwinds Japanese Encephalitis and Zika Viral 5′ Terminal Regions
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 22
AB  - Flavivirus genus includes many deadly viruses such as the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). The 5′ terminal regions (TR) of flaviviruses interact with human proteins and such interactions are critical for viral replication. One of the human proteins identified to interact with the 5′ TR of JEV is the DEAD-box helicase, DDX3X. In this study, we in vitro transcribed the 5′ TR of JEV and demonstrated its direct interaction with recombinant DDX3X (Kd of 1.66 ± 0.21 µM) using microscale thermophoresis (MST). Due to the proposed structural similarities of 5′ and 3′ TRs of flaviviruses, we investigated if the ZIKV 5′ TR could also interact with human DDX3X. Our MST studies suggested that DDX3X recognizes ZIKV 5′ TR with a Kd of 7.05 ± 0.75 µM. Next, we performed helicase assays that suggested that the binding of DDX3X leads to the unwinding of JEV and ZIKV 5′ TRs. Overall, our data indicate, for the first time, that DDX3X can directly bind and unwind in vitro transcribed flaviviral TRs. In summary, our work indicates that DDX3X could be further explored as a therapeutic target to inhibit Flaviviral replication

TI  - Human Endometrial Stromal Cells Are Highly Permissive To Productive Infection by Zika Virus
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a recently re-emerged flavivirus transmitted to humans by mosquito bites but also from mother to fetus and by sexual intercourse. We here show that primary human endometrial stromal cells (HESC) are highly permissive to ZIKV infection and support its in vitro replication. ZIKV envelope expression was detected in the endoplasmic reticulum whereas double-stranded viral RNA colocalized with vimentin filaments to the perinuclear region. ZIKV productive infection also occurred in the human T-HESC cell line together with the induction of interferon-β (IFN-β) and of IFN-stimulated genes. Notably, in vitro decidualization of T-HESC with cyclic AMP and progesterone upregulated the cell surface expression of the ZIKV entry co-receptor AXL and boosted ZIKV replication by ca. 100-fold. Thus, endometrial stromal cells, particularly if decidualized, likely represent a crucial cell target of ZIKV reaching them, either via the uterine vasculature in the viremic phase of the infection or by sexual viral transmission, and a potential source of virus spreading to placental trophoblasts during pregnancy.

TI  - Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived glial cells and neural progenitors display divergent responses to Zika and dengue infections
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 115
SP  - 7117
EP  - 7122
AB  - Significance We describe the ability of the Zika virus to infect various cells of the fetal brain, modeled from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient and grown in identical conditions. Zika is associated with microcephaly, while the similar dengue virus is not. We described differences in the behavior of these two viruses. Zika often fails to trigger efficient antiviral responses, surviving encounters with brain immune cells, and killing immature nerve cell precursors that have poor innate antiviral defenses. Precursors of the brain’s immune cells, microglia, circulating in the fetus, may take the virus to the fetal brain where it will stall growth or cause cell death. We show that interferon-γ efficiently protects against this viral transfer. Maternal Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is recognized as the cause of an epidemic of microcephaly and other neurological anomalies in human fetuses. It remains unclear how ZIKV accesses the highly vulnerable population of neural progenitors of the fetal central nervous system (CNS), and which cell types of the CNS may be viral reservoirs. In contrast, the related dengue virus (DENV) does not elicit teratogenicity. To model viral interaction with cells of the fetal CNS in vitro, we investigated the tropism of ZIKV and DENV for different induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human cells, with a particular focus on microglia-like cells. We show that ZIKV infected isogenic neural progenitors, astrocytes, and microglia-like cells (pMGLs), but was only cytotoxic to neural progenitors. Infected glial cells propagated ZIKV and maintained ZIKV load over time, leading to viral spread to susceptible cells. DENV triggered stronger immune responses and could be cleared by neural and glial cells more efficiently. pMGLs, when cocultured with neural spheroids, invaded the tissue and, when infected with ZIKV, initiated neural infection. Since microglia derive from primitive macrophages originating in proximity to the maternal vasculature, they may act as a viral reservoir for ZIKV and establish infection of the fetal brain. Infection of immature neural stem cells by invading microglia may occur in the early stages of pregnancy, before angiogenesis in the brain rudiments. Our data are also consistent with ZIKV and DENV affecting the integrity of the blood–brain barrier, thus allowing infection of the brain later in life.

TI  - Human Polymorphonuclear Cells Support Zika Virus to Cross Endothelial Monolayer and Access Bloodstream
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - The rapid spread of new outbreaks of human infection caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) has raised many global concerns since 2016. Despite the increasing knowledge of this virus, data on the pathogenesis of ZIKV are still missing. In particular, it is still unknown how the virus crosses the endothelial monolayer and gets access to the bloodstream. In the present work, we used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model to study ZIKV infection in vitro. We demonstrated that HUVECs are an optimal reservoir for viral replication, as they were able to sustain ZIKV infection up to two weeks, without showing a cytopathic effect. In order to evaluate the integrity of endothelial monolayer, immunofluorescence was performed on mock-infected or ZIKV-infected cells ± peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), 48 h p.i., by using an anti-VE-Cadherin antibody, a major adherence protein that maintains the integrity of intercellular junctions. In addition to infection, we noted that the presence of some components of the immune system, such as PMNs, played an important role in altering the endothelial monolayer in cell junctions, suggesting that presence at the site of infection probably promotes the spread of ZIKV in vivo in the bloodstream.

TI  - Human Schwann cells are susceptible to infection with Zika and yellow fever viruses, but not dengue virus
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 9
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerged flavivirus transmitted by Aedes spp mosquitoes that has caused outbreaks of fever and rash on islands in the Pacific and in the Americas. These outbreaks have been associated with neurologic complications that include congenital abnormalities and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The pathogenesis of ZIKV-associated GBS, a potentially life-threatening peripheral nerve disease, remains unclear. Because Schwann cells (SCs) play a central role in peripheral nerve function and can be the target for damage in GBS, we characterized the interactions of ZIKV isolates from Africa, Asia and Brazil with human SCs in comparison with the related mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses yellow fever virus 17D (YFV) and dengue virus type 2 (DENV2). SCs supported sustained replication of ZIKV and YFV, but not DENV. ZIKV infection induced increased SC expression of IL-6, interferon (IFN)β1, IFN-λ, IFIT-1, TNFα and IL-23A mRNAs as well as IFN-λ receptors and negative regulators of IFN signaling. SCs expressed baseline mRNAs for multiple potential flavivirus receptors and levels did not change after ZIKV infection. SCs did not express detectable levels of cell surface Fcγ receptors. This study demonstrates the susceptibility and biological responses of SCs to ZIKV infection of potential importance for the pathogenesis of ZIKV-associated GBS.

TI  - Human Sertoli cells support high levels of Zika virus replication and persistence
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 8
AB  - Zika virus is a teratogenic mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that is associated with birth defects in newborns and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. The virus can also be sexually transmitted, but currently, very little is known about the cell types supporting virus replication and persistence in human testes. Using primary cell cultures, we observed that Sertoli but not Leydig cells are highly susceptible to Zika virus infection, a process that is dependent on the TAM family receptor Axl. In cell culture, Sertoli cells could be productively infected with Zika virus for at least 6-weeks. Infection of Sertoli cells resulted in dramatic changes to the transcriptional profile of these cells. The most upregulated mRNA in infected cells was basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), a cytokine that was found to enhance Zika virus replication and support viral persistence. Together these findings provide key insights into understanding how Zika virus persists in the male reproductive tract and in turn may aid in developing antiviral therapies or strategies to minimize sexual transmission of this pathogen.

TI  - Human stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells support Zika virus replication and provide a relevant model to assess the efficacy of potential antivirals
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy has been extensively linked to microcephaly in newborns. High levels of ZIKV RNA were, however, also detected in mice and non-human primates in organs other than the brain, such as the liver. As ZIKV is a flavivirus closely related to the dengue and yellow fever virus, which are known to cause hepatitis, we here examined whether human hepatocytes are susceptible to ZIKV infection. We demonstrated that both human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) and the Huh7 hepatoma cell line support the complete ZIKV replication cycle. Of three antiviral molecules that inhibit ZIKV infection in Vero cells, only 7-deaza-2’-C-methyladenosine (7DMA) inhibited ZIKV replication in hPSC-HLCs, while all drugs inhibited ZIKV infection in Huh7 cells. ZIKV-infected hPSC-HLCs but not Huh7 cells mounted an innate immune and NFκβ response, which may explain the more extensive cytopathic effect observed in Huh7 cells. In conclusion, ZIKV productively infects human hepatocytes in vitro. However, significant differences in the innate immune response against ZIKV and antiviral drug sensitivity were observed when comparing hPSC-HLCs and hepatoma cells, highlighting the need to assess ZIKV infection as well as antiviral activity not only in hepatoma cells, but also in more physiologically relevant systems.

TI  - Hydroxycarboxylic Acid Receptor 2 Is a Zika Virus Restriction Factor That Can Be Induced by Zika Virus Infection Through the IRE1-XBP1 Pathway
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 9
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arthropod-borne virus and belongs to the Flaviviridae family. The infection of ZIKV has become the global health crisis because of its rapid spread and association with severe neurological disorders, including congenital microcephaly and Guillain-Barre Syndrome. To identify host factors contributing to ZIKV pathogenesis, transcriptomic landscape in ZIKV-infected cells was examined with mRNA microarray analysis and we observed that the expression of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2) could be significantly induced by ZIKV infection. By utilizing two IRE1 inhibitors and XBP1-specific shRNAs, we revealed that the up-regulation of HCAR2 expression induced by ZIKV was dependent on the IRE1-XBP1 pathway. Through the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we generated HCAR2-deficient cell clones in two cell types (human lung carcinoma epithelial A549 cell and human hepatoma Huh7.5 cell). We found that the depletion of HCAR2 significantly increased the replication level of ZIKV, including RNA levels, protein expression levels, and viral titers. In addition, our data demonstrated that the antiviral effect of HCAR2 was not involved in viral entry process and was not dependent on its antilipolytic effect on nicotinic acid/HCAR2-mediated signaling pathway. Taken together, our results indicated that HCAR2 could function as a restriction factor in control of ZIKV replication, potentially providing a novel molecular target for anti-ZIKV therapeutics.

EP  - 18141
AB  - Zika virus is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that causes devastating fetal outcomes in the context of maternal infection during pregnancy. An important target for drugs combatting Zika virus pathogenicity is NS2B-NS3 protease, which plays an essential role in hydrolysis and maturation of the flavivirus polyprotein. We identify hydroxychloroquine, a drug that already has approved uses in pregnancy, as a possible inhibitor of NS2B-NS3 protease by using a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug library, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. Further, to gain insight into its inhibitory potential toward NS2B-NS3 protease, we performed enzyme kinetic studies, which revealed that hydroxychloroquine inhibits protease activity with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 92.34 ± 11.91 μM. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine significantly decreases Zika virus infection in placental cells.

TI  - Hypoxia dampens innate immune signalling at early time points and increases Zika virus RNA levels in iPSC-derived macrophages
JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 104
AB  - Type I interferons (IFNs) are the major host defence against viral infection and are induced following activation of cell surface or intracellular pattern recognition receptors, including retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs). All cellular processes are shaped by the microenvironment and one important factor is the local oxygen tension. The majority of published studies on IFN signalling are conducted under laboratory conditions of 18% oxygen (O2), that do not reflect the oxygen levels in most organs (1–5 % O2). We studied the effect of low oxygen on IFN induction and signalling in induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)-derived macrophages as a model for tissue-resident macrophages and assessed the consequence for Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Hypoxic conditions dampened the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) following RLR stimulation or IFN treatment at early time points. RNA-sequencing and bio-informatic analysis uncovered several pathways including changes in transcription factor availability, the presence of HIF binding sites in promoter regions, and CpG content that may contribute to the reduced ISG expression. Hypoxic conditions increased the abundance of ZIKV RNA highlighting the importance of understanding how low oxygen conditions in the local microenvironment affect pathogen sensing and host defences.

TI  - Identification and characterization of Aedes albopictus long noncoding RNAs provides insights into their roles in development and flavivirus infection
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Aedes albopictus (Ae. albopictus) is an important vector of arboviruses such as Dengue virus (DENV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) have been identified in other vectors including Aedes aegypti and Anopheles mosquitoes, few of which have been implicated in immunity and viral replication. To identify lncRNAs with potential biological functions in Ae. albopictus, we performed RNA-seq on Ae. albopictus cells infected with DENV and ZIKV, and analyzed them together with public datasets. We identified a total of 23,899 transcripts, 16,089 were intergenic while 3,126 and 4,183 of them were antisense and intronic to annotated genes respectively. Ae. albopictus lncRNAs shared many of the characteristics with their invertebrate and vertebrate counterparts, such as low expression, low GC content, short in length, and low conservation even among closely related species. Compared to protein-coding genes, lncRNAs exhibited higher tendency to be expressed in a stage-specific manner. Besides, expression of lncRNAs and nearest protein-coding genes tended to be correlated, especially for the gene pairs within 1kb from each other. We also discovered that Ae. albopictus lncRNAs have the potential to act as precursors for miRNA and piRNAs, both of which have been implicated in antiviral defense in Aedes mosquito. Upon flavivirus infection, lncRNAs were observed to be differentially expressed, which possibly indicates the involvement of lncRNAs in the host-antiviral defense. Our study provides the first systematic identification of lncRNAs in Ae. albopictus, hence, offering a foundation for future studies of lncRNA functions.

TI  - Identification of a critical role for ZIKV capsid α3 in virus assembly and its genetic interaction with M protein
JF  - PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 18
AB  - Flaviviruses such as Zika and dengue viruses are persistent health concerns in endemic regions worldwide. Efforts to combat the spread of flaviviruses have been challenging, as no antivirals or optimal vaccines are available. Prevention and treatment of flavivirus-induced diseases require a comprehensive understanding of their life cycle. However, several aspects of flavivirus biogenesis, including genome packaging and virion assembly, are not well characterized. In this study, we focused on flavivirus capsid protein (C) using Zika virus (ZIKV) as a model to investigate the role of the externally oriented α3 helix (C α3) without a known or predicted function. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of surface-exposed amino acids on C α3 revealed a critical CN67 residue essential for ZIKV virion production. The CN67A mutation did not affect dimerization or RNA binding of purified C protein in vitro. The virus assembly is severely affected in cells transfected with an infectious cDNA clone of ZIKV with CN67A mutation, resulting in a highly attenuated phenotype. We isolated a revertant virus with a partially restored phenotype by continuous passage of the CN67A mutant virus in Vero E6 cells. Sequence analysis of the revertant revealed a second site mutation in the viral membrane (M) protein MF37L, indicating a genetic interaction between the C and M proteins of ZIKV. Introducing the MF37L mutation on the mutant ZIKV CN67A generated a double-mutant virus phenotypically consistent with the isolated genetic revertant. Similar results were obtained with analogous mutations on C and M proteins of dengue virus, suggesting the critical nature of C α3 and possible C and M residues contributing to virus assembly in other Aedes-transmitted flaviviruses. This study provides the first experimental evidence of a genetic interaction between the C protein and the viral envelope protein M, providing a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions involved in the assembly and budding of Aedes-transmitted flaviviruses.

TI  - Identification of a pocket factor that is critical to Zika virus assembly
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito borne flavivirus and a major public health concern causing severe disease. Due to the presence of a lipid membrane and structural heterogeneity, attaining an atomic resolution structure is challenging, but important to understand virus assembly and life cycle mechanisms that offer distinct targets for therapeutic intervention. We here use subvolume refinement to achieve a 3.4 Å resolution structure and identify two distinct lipid moieties. The first arises from the inner leaflet and is coordinated by hydrophobic residues of the M and E transmembrane helices that form a binding pocket not previously characterized. The second lipid arises from the outer leaflet coordinate between two E protein helices. Structure-based mutagenesis identifies critical hydrophobic interactions and their effect on the virus life cycle. Results show that lipids play an essential role in the ZIKV assembly pathway revealing a potential target of lipid based antiviral drug development. Here, the authors provide a 3.4 Å resolution structure of mature Zika virus (ZIKV) and identify two lipid moieties, coordinated by hydrophobic residues of the M and E transmembrane helices and between two helices of E protein, that play an essential role in the ZIKV assembly pathway.

TI  - Identification of Aedes aegypti salivary gland proteins interacting with human immune receptor proteins
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 16
AB  - Mosquito saliva proteins modulate the human immune and hemostatic systems and control mosquito-borne pathogenic infections. One mechanism through which mosquito proteins may influence host immunity and hemostasis is their interactions with key human receptor proteins that may act as receptors for or coordinate attacks against invading pathogens. Here, using pull-down assays and proteomics-based mass spectrometry, we identified 11 Ae. aegypti salivary gland proteins (SGPs) (e.g., apyrase, Ae. aegypti venom allergen-1 [AaVA-1], neutrophil stimulating protein 1 [NeSt1], and D7 proteins), that interact with one or more of five human receptor proteins (cluster of differentiation 4 [CD4], CD14, CD86, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin [DC-SIGN], and Toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4]). We focused on CD4- and DC-SIGN-interacting proteins and confirmed that CD4 directly interacts with AaVA-1, D7, and NeST1 recombinant proteins and that AaVA-1 showed a moderate interaction with DC-SIGN using ELISA. Bacteria responsive protein 1 (AgBR1), an Ae. aegypti saliva protein reported to enhance ZIKV infection in humans but that was not identified in our pull-down assay moderately interacts with CD4 in the ELISA assay. Functionally, we showed that AaVA-1 and NeST1 proteins promoted activation of CD4+ T cells. We propose the possible impact of these interactions and effects on mosquito-borne viral infections such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. Overall, this study provides key insight into the vector-host (protein-protein) interaction network and suggests roles for these interactions in mosquito-borne viral infections.

TI  - Identification of anti-flaviviral drugs with mosquitocidal and anti-Zika virus activity in Aedes aegypti
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging arbovirus belonging to the genus Flavivirus, is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. ZIKV infection can cause microcephaly of newborn babies and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. Because no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is available for ZIKV infection, the most commonly used approach to control the spread of ZIKV is suppression of the mosquito vector population. A novel proposed strategy to block arthropod virus (arbovirus) transmission is based on the chemical inhibition of virus infection in mosquitoes. However, only a few drugs and compounds have been tested with such properties. Here we present a comprehensive screen of 55 FDA-approved anti-flaviviral drugs for potential anti-ZIKV and mosquitocidal activity. Four drugs (auranofin, actinomycin D (Act-D), bortezomib and gemcitabine) were toxic to C6/36 cells, and two drugs (5-fluorouracil and mycophenolic acid (MPA)) significantly reduced ZIKV production in C6/36 cells at 2 μM and 0.5 μM, respectively. Three drugs (Act-D, cyclosporin A, ivermectin) exhibited a strong adulticidal activity, and six drugs (U18666A, retinoic acid p-hydroxyanilide (4-HPR), clotrimazole, bortezomib, MPA, imatinib mesylate) significantly suppressed ZIKV infection in mosquito midguts. Some of these FDA-approved drugs may have potential for use for the development of ZIKV transmission-blocking strategies.

TI  - Identification of antiviral RNAi regulators, ILF3/DHX9, recruit at ZIKV stem loop B to protect against ZIKV induced microcephaly
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 16
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family and causes congenital microcephaly and Guillain–Barré syndrome. Currently, there is a lack of approved vaccines or therapies against ZIKV infection. In this study, we profile vRNA‒host protein interactomes at ZIKV stem‒loop B (SLB) and reveal that interleukin enhancer binding factor 3 (ILF3) and DEAH-box helicase 9 (DHX9) form positive regulators of antiviral RNA inference in undifferentiated human neuroblastoma cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human neural stem cells (iPSC–NSCs). Functionally, ablation of ILF3 in brain organoids and Nestin-Cre ILF3 cKO foetal mice significantly enhance ZIKV replication and aggravated ZIKV-induced microcephalic phenotypes. Mechanistically, ILF3/DHX9 enhance DICER processing of ZIKV vRNA-derived siRNAs (vsiR-1 and vsiR-2) to exert anti-flavivirus activity. VsiR-1 strongly inhibits ZIKV NS5 polymerase activity and RNA translation. Treatment with the vsiR-1 mimic inhibits ZIKV replication in vitro and in vivo and protected mice from ZIKV-induced microcephaly. Overall, we propose a novel therapeutic strategy to combat flavivirus infection.

TI  - Identification of Antiviral Roles for the Exon-Junction Complex and Nonsense-Mediated Decay in Flaviviral Infection
JF  - Nature microbiology
VL  - 4
SP  - 985
EP  - 995
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, related to dengue virus and Zika virus. To gain insight into host pathways involved in WNV infection, we performed a systematic affinity-tag purification mass spectrometry (APMS) study to identify 259 WNV-interacting human proteins. RNA interference screening revealed 26 genes that both interact with WNV proteins and influence WNV infection. We found that WNV, dengue and Zika virus capsids interact with a conserved subset of proteins that impact infection. These include the exon–junction complex (EJC) recycling factor PYM1, which is antiviral against all three viruses. The EJC has roles in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), and we found that both the EJC and NMD are antiviral and the EJC protein RBM8A directly binds WNV RNA. To counteract this, flavivirus infection inhibits NMD and the capsid–PYM1 interaction interferes with EJC protein function and localization. Depletion of PYM1 attenuates RBM8A binding to viral RNA, suggesting that WNV sequesters PYM1 to protect viral RNA from decay. Together, these data suggest a complex interplay between the virus and host in regulating NMD and the EJC. Proteomic analysis coupled to RNA interference screening identifies the host exon–junction complex recycling factor partner of Y14 and mago (PYM1) as antiviral against three flaviruses, whose capsids interact with PYM1 and interfere with its ability to trigger nonsense-mediated decay-dependent degradation of viral RNA.

TI  - Identification of host factors binding to dengue and Zika virus subgenomic RNA by efficient yeast three-hybrid screens of the human ORFeome
JF  - RNA Biology
VL  - 18
SP  - 732
EP  - 744
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses such as the dengue (DENV) and the Zika virus (ZIKV) are important human pathogens causing around 100 million symptomatic infections each year. During infection, small subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) are formed inside the infected host cell as a result of incomplete degradation of the viral RNA genome by cellular exoribonuclease XRN1. Although the full extent of sfRNA functions is to be revealed, these non-coding RNAs are key virulence factors and their detrimental effects on multiple cellular processes seem to consistently involve molecular interactions with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Discovery of such sfRNA-binding host-factors has followed established biochemical pull-down approaches skewed towards highly abundant proteins hampering proteome-wide coverage. Yeast three-hybrid (Y3H) systems represent an attractive alternative approach. To facilitate proteome-wide screens for RBP, we revisited and improved existing RNA-Y3H methodology by (1) implementing full-length ORF libraries in combination with (2) efficient yeast mating to increase screening depth and sensitivity, and (3) stringent negative controls to eliminate over-representation of non-specific RNA-binders. These improvements were validated employing the well-characterized interaction between DDX6 (DEAD-box helicase 6) and sfRNA of DENV as paradigm. Our advanced Y3H system was used to screen for human proteins binding to DENV and ZIKV sfRNA, resulting in a list of 69 putative sfRNA-binders, including several previously reported as well as numerous novel RBP host factors. Our methodology requiring no sophisticated infrastructure or analytic pipeline may be employed for the discovery of meaningful RNA–protein interactions at large scale in other fields.

TI  - Identification of NECTIN1 as a novel restriction factor for flavivirus infection
JF  - mBio
VL  - 15
AB  - ABSTRACT Nectin cell adhesion molecule 1 (NECTIN1) is a cell adhesion molecule that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It has been considered the most ubiquitous receptor for herpesviruses. However, in the context of flavivirus infection, its role was previously unknown. In this study, we described an arrayed siRNA screen mainly targeting Ig-like proteins that showed NECTIN1-restricted bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection. We demonstrated that the depletion of NECTIN1 could significantly enhance the infection of both biotypes and multiple genotypes of BVDV, including BVDV-1a, -1b, -1c, -1p, -1m, -1v, and -2a. Notably, the IgV of NECTIN1 has emerged as the key domain restricting BVDV infection. Moreover, NECTIN1 inhibited BVDV attachment without exerting a significant influence on BVDV translation or transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrated that both NECTIN1 and CD46 could bind to BVDV E2, while the binding affinity of NECTIN1 for BVDV E2 was greater than that for CD46. We further identified that the BVDV E2 domain DD was a key domain of BVDV interacting with NECTIN1. In addition, we showed that NECTIN1 inhibited infections by classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), which belong to the Flaviviridae family, but had limited effects on bluetongue virus (BTV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Akabane virus (AKAV), and Sindbis virus (SINV). Overall, our study has important implications for understanding the entry of BVDV and revealed a novel role for NECTIN1 as a restriction factor that inhibits flavivirus infection. IMPORTANCE NECTIN1, also known as CD111 or PVRL1, has been recognized as the primary receptor for several alpha herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1). However, our study revealed a novel role for NECTIN1 in the virus life cycle by influencing BVDV infection. Contrary to its role as a receptor for alpha herpesviruses, NECTIN1 acts as a restriction factor for BVDV by inhibiting viral attachment via competition with CD46 for binding to the domain DD of BVDV E2. We further revealed that the replication of members of the Flaviviridae family was inhibited by NECTIN1, while the replication of other RNA viruses did not significantly differ. Our results demonstrate that NECTIN1 is a novel factor restricting Flaviviridae family virus replication and highlight the complexity of virus-host interactions and the multifaceted nature of host factors involved in viral infection.

TI  - Identification of the viral RNA promoter stem loop A (SLA)-binding site on Zika virus polymerase NS5
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 10
AB  - Zika virus has recently emerged as an important human pathogen that has spread to more than 60 countries. Infection of a pregnant woman with Zika virus can cause severe brain malformations in the child such as microcephaly and other birth defects. Despite the medical importance of Zika virus infection, the mechanism of viral replication, a process commonly targeted by antiviral therapeutics, is not well understood. Stem-loop A (SLA), located in the 5′ untranslated region of the viral genome, acts as a promotor for viral replication and thus is critical for recognition of the viral genome by the viral polymerase NS5. However, how NS5 engages SLA is not clear. We have quantitatively examined the intrinsic affinities between Zika virus SLA and NS5, and identified the SLA-binding site on NS5. Amino acid substitutions in the thumb subdomain of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the methyltransferase (MTase) domain reduced SLA-binding affinity, indicating that they each are part of the SLA-binding site. Furthermore, stopped-flow kinetic analysis of Zika NS5-, RdRp- and MTase–SLA interactions identified distinct intermediates during NS5 and SLA complex formation. These data suggest a model for SLA recognition and the initiation of flaviviral replication by NS5.

TI  - Identification of TRIM21 and TRIM14 as Antiviral Factors Against Langat and Zika Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 17
AB  - Flaviviruses are usually transmitted to humans via mosquito or tick bites, whose infections may lead to severe diseases and fatality. During intracellular infection, they remodel the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to generate compartments scaffolding the replication complex (RC) where replication of the viral genome takes place. In this study, we purified the ER membrane fraction of virus infected cells to identify the proteins that were enriched during flavivirus infection. We found that tripartite motif-containing proteins (TRIMs) including TRIM38, TRIM21, and TRIM14 were significantly enriched during infection with mosquito-borne (West Nile virus strain Kunjin and Zika virus (ZIKV)) and tick-borne (Langat virus (LGTV)) flaviviruses. Further characterizations showed that TRIM21 and TRIM14 act as restriction factors against ZIKV and LGTV, while TRIM38 hinders ZIKV infection. These TRIMs worked as interferon-stimulated genes to mediate IFN-I response against LGTV and ZIKV infections. Restriction of ZIKV by TRIM14 and TRIM38 coincides with their colocalization with ZIKV NS3. TRIM14-mediated LGTV restriction coincides with its colocalization with LGTV NS3 and NS5 proteins. However, TRIM21 did not colocalize with ZIKV and LGTV NS3 or NS5 protein suggesting its antiviral activity is not dependent on direct targeting the viral enzyme. Finally, we demonstrated that overexpression of TRIM21 and TRIM14 restricted LGTV replication.

AB  - Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne human flavivirus responsible that causing emergency outbreaks in Brazil. ZIKV is suspected of causing Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults and microcephaly. The NS2B-NS3 protease and NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), central to ZIKV multiplication, have been identified as attractive molecular targets for drugs. We performed a structure-based virtual screening of 2,659 FDA-approved small molecule drugs in the DrugBank database using AutoDock Vina in PyRx v0.8. Accordingly, 15 potential drugs were selected as ZIKV inhibitors because of their high values (binding affinity - binding energy) and we analyzed the molecular interactions between the active site amino acids and the compounds. Among these drugs, tamsulosin was found to interact most efficiently with NS2B/NS3 protease, as indicated by the lowest binding energy value (−8.27 kJ/mol), the highest binding affinity (−5.7 Kcal/mol), and formed H-bonds with amino acid residues TYRB130, SERB135, TYRB150. Furthermore, biotin was found to interact most efficiently with NS5 RdRp with a binding energy of −150.624 kJ/mol, a binding affinity of −5.6 Kcal/mol, and formed H-bonds with the amino acid residues ASPA665 and ASPA540. In vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies are needed to demonstrate anti-ZIKV safety and the efficacy of these FDA-approved drug candidates. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

TI  - IFITMs exhibit antiviral activity against Chikungunya and Zika virus infection via the alteration of TLRs and RLRs signaling pathways
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 15
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) poses a significant challenge as there are currently no targeted antiviral drugs or vaccines to combat this infection. Here, we demonstrate that interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), including IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, which are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), inhibit CHIKV infection in human skin fibroblasts. Overexpression of IFITMs in cells restricts viral infection, whereas knockdown of IFITMs enhances viral infection. IFITMs overexpression causes a substantial upregulation of antiviral genes, namely TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, and their downstream signaling molecules such as TRADD, IRAK1, TRAF6, and MAP3K7, involved in TLRs signaling pathways. Furthermore, the DHX58 gene encoding the LGP2 protein, a negative regulator of RIG-I in RLRs signaling pathways, was downregulated in the overexpressed cells. Transcription factors including interferon regulatory factors (IRF) 3/5/7, which are downstream signaling components of both TLR and RLR signaling pathways, were also upregulated, resulting in enhanced IFNs signaling. IFITMs not only inhibits the early and late stages of viral infection but can also alter the antiviral innate-immune response to restrict CHIKV infection in human skin fibroblasts. Additionally, IFITMs exhibit their antiviral activity against Zika virus (ZIKV). Altogether, these results show the broad-spectrum antiviral property of IFITMs against arboviruses in foreskin cells.

TI  - IL-1 receptor antagonist therapy mitigates placental dysfunction and perinatal injury following Zika virus infection.
JF  - JCI insight
VL  - 4 7
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy causes significant adverse sequelae in the developing fetus, and results in long-term structural and neurologic defects. Most preventive and therapeutic efforts have focused on the development of vaccines, antivirals, and antibodies. The placental immunologic response to ZIKV, however, has been largely overlooked as a target for therapeutic intervention. The placental inflammatory response, specifically IL-1β secretion and signaling, is induced by ZIKV infection and represents an environmental factor that is known to increase the risk of perinatal developmental abnormalities. We show in a mouse model that maternally administrated IL-1 receptor antagonist (IRA; Kineret, or anakinra), following ZIKV exposure, can preserve placental function (by improving trophoblast invasion and placental vasculature), increase fetal viability, and reduce neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring. We further demonstrate that while ZIKV RNA is highly detectable in placentas, it is not correlated with fetal viability. Beyond its effects in the placenta, we show that IL-1 blockade may also directly decrease fetal neuroinflammation by mitigating fetal microglial activation in a dose-dependent manner. Our studies distinguish the role of placental inflammation during ZIKV-infected pregnancies, and demonstrate that maternal IRA may attenuate fetal neuroinflammation and improve perinatal outcomes.

TI  - Iminosugars With Endoplasmic Reticulum α-Glucosidase Inhibitor Activity Inhibit ZIKV Replication and Reverse Cytopathogenicity in vitro
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), a vector-borne virus of the family Flaviviridae, continues to spread and remains a significant global public health threat. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or antivirals against ZIKV. We investigated the anti-ZIKV ability of three iminosugars with endoplasmic reticulum α-glucosidase inhibitor (ER-AGI) activity, namely deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), castanospermine, and celgosivir. None of the three iminosugars showed any significant cytotoxicity in Vero or human microglia CHME3 cells when applied for 72 h at concentrations up to 100 μM. Iminosugar treatment of Vero or CHME3 cells prior to ZIKV infection resulted in significant inhibition of ZIKV replication over 48 h. Reduction in ZIKV replication in iminosugar-treated cells was not associated with any significant change in the expression levels of key antiviral genes. Following infection with three different strains of ZIKV, iminosugar-treated Vero or CHME3 cells showed no cell death, whereas vehicle-treated control cells exhibited 50–60% cell death at 72 h post-infection (hpi). While there was no significant difference in apoptosis between iminosugar-treated and control cells, iminosugar-treated cells exhibited a substantial reduction of necrosis at 72 hpi following ZIKV infection. In summary, iminosugars with ER-AGI activity inhibit ZIKV replication and significantly reduce necrosis without altering the antiviral gene expression and apoptosis of infected human cells. The results of this study strongly suggest that iminosugars are promising anti-ZIKV antiviral agents and such warrant further in vivo studies.

TI  - Immune Evasion Strategies Used by Zika Virus to Infect the Fetal Eye and Brain.
JF  - Viral immunology
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that caused a public health emergency in the Americas when an outbreak in Brazil became linked to congenital microcephaly. Understanding how ZIKV could evade the innate immune defenses of the mother, placenta, and fetus has become central to determining how the virus can traffic into the fetal brain. ZIKV, like other flaviviruses, evades host innate immune responses by leveraging viral proteins and other processes that occur during viral replication to allow spread to the placenta. Within the placenta, there are diverse cell types with coreceptors for ZIKV entry, creating an opportunity for the virus to establish a reservoir for replication and infect the fetus. The fetal brain is vulnerable to ZIKV, particularly during the first trimester, when it is beginning a dynamic process, to form highly complex and specialized regions orchestrated by neuroprogenitor cells. In this review, we provide a conceptual framework to understand the different routes for viral trafficking into the fetal brain and the eye, which are most likely to occur early and later in pregnancy. Based on the injury profile in human and nonhuman primates, ZIKV entry into the fetal brain likely occurs across both the blood/cerebrospinal fluid barrier in the choroid plexus and the blood/brain barrier. ZIKV can also enter the eye by trafficking across the blood/retinal barrier. Ultimately, the efficient escape of innate immune defenses by ZIKV is a key factor leading to viral infection. However, the host immune response against ZIKV can lead to injury and perturbations in developmental programs that drive cellular division, migration, and brain growth. The combined effect of innate immune evasion to facilitate viral propagation and the maternal/placental/fetal immune response to control the infection will determine the extent to which ZIKV can injure the fetal brain.

TI  - Immune Recognition versus Immune Evasion Systems in Zika Virus Infection
JF  - Biomedicines
VL  - 11
AB  - The reemergence of the Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in recent years has posed a serious threat to global health. Despite being asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in a majority of infected individuals, ZIKV infection can result in severe manifestations including neurological complications in adults and congenital abnormalities in newborns. In a human host, ZIKV is primarily recognized by RIG-like receptors and Toll-like receptors that elicit anti-viral immunity through the secretion of type I interferon (IFN) to limit viral survival, replication, and pathogenesis. Intriguingly, ZIKV evades its host immune system through various immune evasion strategies, including suppressing the innate immune receptors and signaling pathways, mutation of viral structural and non-structural proteins, RNA modulation, or alteration of cellular pathways. Here, we present an overview of ZIKV recognition by the host immune system and the evasion strategies employed by ZIKV. Characterization of the host–viral interaction and viral disease mechanism provide a platform for the rational design of novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against ZIKV infection.

SP  - 279
EP  - 308
AB  - Flaviviruses such as dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), and Zika (ZIKV) are human pathogens of global significance. In particular, DENV causes the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral diseases in humans, and ZIKV emerged from obscurity into the spotlight in 2016 as the etiologic agent of congenital Zika syndrome. Owing to the recent emergence of ZIKV as a global pandemic threat, the roles of the immune system during ZIKV infections are as yet unclear. In contrast, decades of DENV research implicate a dual role for the immune system in protection against and pathogenesis of DENV infection. As DENV and ZIKV are closely related, knowledge based on DENV studies has been used to prioritize investigation of ZIKV immunity and pathogenesis, and to accelerate ZIKV diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine design. This review discusses the following topics related to innate and adaptive immune responses to DENV and ZIKV: the interferon system as the key mechanism of host defense and viral target for immune evasion, antibody-mediated protection versus antibody-dependent enhancement, and T cell-mediated protection versus original T cell antigenic sin. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the balance between immune-mediated protection and pathogenesis during DENV and ZIKV infections is critical toward development of safe and effective DENV and ZIKV therapeutics and vaccines.

TI  - Importance of Zika Virus NS5 Protein for Viral Replication
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 8
AB  - Zika virus is the latest addition to an ever-growing list of arboviruses that are causing outbreaks with serious consequences. A few mild cases were recorded between 1960 and 1980 until the first major outbreak in 2007 on Yap Island. This was followed by more severe outbreaks in French Polynesia (2013) and Brazil (2015), which significantly increased both Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly cases. No current vaccines or treatments are available, however, recent studies have taken interest in the NS5 protein which encodes both the viral methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This makes it important for viral replication alongside other important functions such as inhibiting the innate immune system thus ensuring virus survival and replication. Structural studies can help design inhibitors, while biochemical studies can help understand the various mechanisms utilized by NS5 thus counteracting them might inhibit or abolish the viral infection. Drug repurposing targeting the NS5 protein has also proven to be an effective tool since hundreds of thousands of compounds can be screened therefore saving time and resources, moreover information on these compounds might already be available especially if they are used to treat other ailments.

TI  - Importin-7-dependent nuclear translocation of the Flavivirus core protein is required for infectious virus production
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 20
AB  - Flaviviridae is a family of positive-stranded RNA viruses, including human pathogens, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and West Nile virus (WNV). Nuclear localization of the viral core protein is conserved among Flaviviridae, and this feature may be targeted for developing broad-ranging anti-flavivirus drugs. However, the mechanism of core protein translocation to the nucleus and the importance of nuclear translocation in the viral life cycle remain unknown. We aimed to identify the molecular mechanism underlying core protein nuclear translocation. We identified importin-7 (IPO7), an importin-β family protein, as a nuclear carrier for Flaviviridae core proteins. Nuclear import assays revealed that core protein was transported into the nucleus via IPO7, whereas IPO7 deletion by CRISPR/Cas9 impaired their nuclear translocation. To understand the importance of core protein nuclear translocation, we evaluated the production of infectious virus or single-round-infectious-particles in wild-type or IPO7-deficient cells; both processes were significantly impaired in IPO7-deficient cells, whereas intracellular infectious virus levels were equivalent in wild-type and IPO7-deficient cells. These results suggest that IPO7-mediated nuclear translocation of core proteins is involved in the release of infectious virus particles of flaviviruses.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo inhibition of the host TRPC4 channel attenuates Zika virus infection
JF  - EMBO Molecular Medicine
VL  - 16
SP  - 1817
EP  - 1839
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection may lead to severe neurological consequences, including seizures, and early infancy death. However, the involved mechanisms are still largely unknown. TRPC channels play an important role in regulating nervous system excitability and are implicated in seizure development. We investigated whether TRPCs might be involved in the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection. We found that ZIKV infection increases TRPC4 expression in host cells via the interaction between the ZIKV-NS3 protein and CaMKII, enhancing TRPC4-mediated calcium influx. Pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII decreased both pCREB and TRPC4 protein levels, whereas the suppression of either TRPC4 or CaMKII improved the survival rate of ZIKV-infected cells and reduced viral protein production, likely by impeding the replication phase of the viral life cycle. TRPC4 or CaMKII inhibitors also reduced seizures and increased the survival of ZIKV-infected neonatal mice and blocked the spread of ZIKV in brain organoids derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. These findings suggest that targeting CaMKII or TRPC4 may offer a promising approach for developing novel anti-ZIKV therapies, capable of preventing ZIKV-associated seizures and death.

TI  - In Vitro Zika Virus Infection of Human Neural Progenitor Cells: Meta-Analysis of RNA-Seq Assays
JF  - Microorganisms
VL  - 8
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emergent arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) responsible for congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and a range of other congenital malformations. Evidence shows that ZIKV infects human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) in the fetal brain, prompting inflammation and tissue damage/loss. Despite recent advances, little is known about the pathways involved in CZS pathogenesis. We performed a meta-analysis, gene ontology (GO), and pathway analysis of whole transcriptome studies with the aim of clarifying the genes and pathways potentially altered during hNPCs infection with ZIKV. We selected three studies (17 samples of infected hPNCs compared to hPNCs uninfected controls) through a systematic search of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The raw reads were trimmed, counted, and normalized. Next, we performed a rank product meta-analysis to detect consistently differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in these independent experiments. We detected 13 statistically significant DEGs. GO ontology and reactome analysis showed an enrichment of interferon, pro-inflammatory, and chemokines signaling and apoptosis pathways in ZIKV-infected cells. Moreover, we detected three possible new candidate genes involved in hNPCs infection: APOL6, XAF1, and TNFRSF1. Our results confirm that interferon (IFN) signaling dominates the ZIKV response, and that a crucial contribution is given by apoptotic pathways, which might elicit the CZS phenotype.

TI  - Increased blood meal size and feeding frequency compromise Aedes aegypti midgut integrity and enhance dengue virus dissemination
JF  - PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 17
AB  - Aedes aegypti is a highly efficient vector for numerous pathogenic arboviruses including dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus, and yellow fever virus. This efficiency can in part be attributed to their frequent feeding behavior. We previously found that acquisition of a second, full, non-infectious blood meal could accelerate virus dissemination within the mosquito by temporarily compromising midgut basal lamina integrity; however, in the wild, mosquitoes are often interrupted during feeding and only acquire partial or minimal blood meals. To explore the impact of this feeding behavior further, we examined the effects of partial blood feeding on DENV dissemination rates and midgut basal lamina damage in Ae. aegypti. DENV-infected mosquitoes given a secondary partial blood meal had intermediate rates of dissemination and midgut basal lamina damage compared to single-fed and fully double-fed counterparts. Subsequently, we evaluated if basal lamina damage accumulated across feeding episodes. Interestingly, within 24 hours of feeding, damage was proportional to the number of blood meals imbibed; however, this additive effect returned to baseline levels by 96 hours. These data reveal that midgut basal lamina damage and rates of dissemination are proportional to feeding frequency and size, and further demonstrate the impact that mosquito feeding behavior has on vector competence and arbovirus epidemiology. This work has strong implications for our understanding of virus transmission in the field and will be useful when designing laboratory experiments and creating more accurate models of virus spread and maintenance.

TI  - Increased temperatures reduce the vectorial capacity of Aedes mosquitoes for Zika virus
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 9
SP  - 67
EP  - 77
AB  - Rapid and significant range expansion of both ZIKV and its Aedes host species has resulted in ZIKV being declared a global health threat. Mean temperatures are projected to increase globally, likely resulting in alterations of the transmission potential of mosquito-borne pathogens. The relationship between temperature and ZIKV transmission has not been well characterised for Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. To understand the effect of diurnal temperature range on the vectorial capacity of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus for ZIKV, factors contributing to transmission potential were measured at different temperature regimens. Their longevity and blood feeding rates were assessed, and vector competence was determined following feeding on blood meals with 8.3 log10 PFU/ml ZIKV. Higher temperature resulted in decreased longevity of Ae. aegypti [Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) Test, Chi-square, df 35.66, 5 P (<0.0001)] and a significant decrease in blood feeding rates across groups [Z score (−5.8478) P (0.0444)]. Temperature had a population and species-specific impact on ZIKV infection rates. Overall, Ae. albopictus reared at the lowest temperature regimen demonstrated the highest vectorial capacity (1.63) and the highest transmission efficiency (57%). Temperature increases decreased vectorial capacity across groups, yet the largest decreases were measured for Ae. aegypti. The results of this study suggest that future climate change could significantly impact vector competence, blood feeding behavior and longevity, and therefore decrease the overall vectorial capacity of Aedes mosquitoes. It is also clear that this impact is likely to be both species and population-specific.

TI  - Infection with a Brazilian isolate of Zika virus generates RIG‐I stimulatory RNA and the viral NS5 protein blocks type I IFN induction and signaling
JF  - European Journal of Immunology
VL  - 48
SP  - 1120
EP  - 1136
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a major public health concern in the Americas. We report that ZIKV infection and RNA extracted from ZIKV infected cells potently activated the induction of type I interferons (IFNs). This effect was fully dependent on the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), implicating RIG‐I‐like receptors (RLRs) as upstream sensors of viral RNA. Indeed, RIG‐I and the related RNA sensor MDA5 contributed to type I IFN induction in response to RNA from infected cells. We found that ZIKV NS5 from a recent Brazilian isolate blocked type I IFN induction downstream of RLRs and also inhibited type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) signaling. We defined the ZIKV NS5 nuclear localization signal and report that NS5 nuclear localization was not required for inhibition of signaling downstream of IFNAR. Mechanistically, NS5 blocked IFNAR signaling by both leading to reduced levels of STAT2 and by blocking phosphorylation of STAT1, two transcription factors activated by type I IFNs. Taken together, our observations suggest that ZIKV infection induces a type I IFN response via RLRs and that ZIKV interferes with this response by blocking signaling downstream of RLRs and IFNAR.

TI  - Infection with flaviviruses requires BCLXL for cell survival
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - BCL2 family proteins including pro-survival proteins, BH3-only proteins and BAX/BAK proteins control mitochondria-mediated apoptosis to maintain cell homeostasis via the removal of damaged cells and pathogen-infected cells. In this study, we examined the roles of BCL2 proteins in the induction of apoptosis in cells upon infection with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus and Zika virus. We showed that survival of the infected cells depends on BCLXL, a pro-survival BCL2 protein due to suppression of the expression of another pro-survival protein, MCL1. Treatment with BCLXL inhibitors, as well as deficient BCLXL gene expression, induced BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis upon infection with flaviviruses. Flavivirus infection attenuates cellular protein synthesis, which confers reduction of short-half-life proteins like MCL1. Inhibition of BCLXL increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, thereby suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. Furthermore, we examined the roles of BCLXL in the death of JEV-infected cells during in vivo infection. Haploinsufficiency of the BCLXL gene, as well as administration of BH3 mimetic compounds, increased survival rate after challenge of JEV infection and suppressed inflammation. These results suggest that BCLXL plays a crucial role in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses, and that BCLXL may provide a novel antiviral target to suppress propagation of the family of Flaviviridae viruses.

TI  - Inflammatory-dependent Sting activation induces antiviral autophagy to limit zika virus in the Drosophila brain
JF  - Autophagy
VL  - 15
SP  - 1
EP  - 3
AB  - ABSTRACT Incidences of congenital syndrome associated with maternal zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy are well documented; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which ZIKV infection causes these devastating fetal pathologies are still under active investigation. ZIKV is a member of the flavivirus family and is mainly transmitted to human hosts through Aedes mosquito vectors. However, in vivo models for the neurological tropism of the virus and the arthropod vector have been lacking. A recent study published in Cell Host & Microbe from Dr. Sara Cherry’s lab investigates both of these key aspects of the ZIKV infectious life cycle. Liu et al. demonstrate how inflammatory activated Sting/dSTING-dependent antiviral macroautophagy/autophagy is sufficient to restrict ZIKV infection in the Drosophila melanogaster brain. Additionally, this study provides further evidence for the ancestral function of autophagy in protecting host cells from viral invaders.

TI  - Influence of Pyrethroid Resistance on Vector Competency for Zika Virus by Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)
JF  - Journal of Medical Entomology
VL  - 58
SP  - 1908
EP  - 1916
AB  - Abstract The vector competence of mosquitoes for pathogens has been shown to be influenced by the status of insecticide resistance in the mosquito population. However, to date, only two studies has explored the impact of insecticide resistance on arbovirus transmission. The global and widespread use of pyrethroids has led to the development of insecticide resistance in many mosquito species, including Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) (Diptera: Culicidae), the primary vector of Zika virus. Strains of Ae. aegypti that were genetically similar, but responded differently to pyrethroid exposure, were developed using backcrossing techniques. These populations were orally infected with Zika virus and susceptibility to infection, disseminated infection, and transmission potential were evaluated. Analyses revealed differences in susceptibility to infection and disseminated infection between the pyrethroid susceptible and resistant strains of Ae. aegypti during the infection period. Here, we identify an additional challenge to that of widespread pyrethroid resistance. Specifically, resistance is associated with altered phenotypic traits that influence susceptibility to arbovirus infection and progression of infection in the mosquito, factors which ultimately influence risk of arbovirus transmission. These findings support the need to 1) consider insecticide resistance status during times of arbovirus transmission and 2) to implement insecticide resistance management/mitigation strategies in vector control programs.

TI  - Influence of Zika virus 3′-end sequence and nonstructural protein evolution on the viral replication competence and virulence
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 11
SP  - 2447
EP  - 2465
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) has been circulating in human networks over 70 years since its first appearance in Africa, yet little is known about whether the viral 3′-terminal sequence and nonstructural (NS) protein diverged genetically from ancient ZIKV have different effects on viral replication and virulence in currently prevailing Asian lineage ZIKV. Here we show, by a reverse genetics approach using an infectious cDNA clone for a consensus sequence (Con1) of ZIKV, which represents Asian ZIKV strains, and another clone derived from the MR766 strain isolated in Uganda, Africa in 1947, that the 3′-end sequence –UUUCU-3′ homogeneously present in MR766 genome and the –GUCU-3′ sequence strictly conserved in Asian ZIKV isolates are functionally equivalent in viral replication and gene expression. By gene swapping experiments using the two infectious cDNA clones, we show that the NS1–5 proteins of MR766 enhance replication competence of ZIKV Con1. The Con1, which was less virulent than MR766, acquired severe bilateral hindlimb paralysis when its NS1–5 genes were replaced by the counterparts of MR766 in type I interferon receptor (IFNAR1)-deficient A129 mice. Moreover, MR766 NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) alone also rendered the Con1 virulent, despite there being no difference in RdRp activity between MR766 and Con1 NS5 proteins. By contrast, the Con1 derivatives expressing MR766 Nsps, like Con1, did not develop severe disease in wild-type mice treated with an IFNAR1 blocking antibody. Together, our findings uncover an unprecedented role for ZIKV NS proteins in determining viral pathogenicity in immunocompromised hosts.

TI  - Inhibiting cardiac autophagy suppresses Zika virus replication
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Zika Virus (ZIKV) infection is a global threat. Other than the congenital neurological disorders it causes, ZIKV infection has been reported to induce cardiac complications. However, the precise treatment plans are unclear. Thus, illustrating the pathogenic mechanism of ZIKV in the heart is critical to providing effective prevention and treatment of ZIKV infection. The mechanism of autophagy has been reported recently in Dengue virus infection. Whether or not autophagy participates in ZIKV infection and its role remains unrevealed. This study successfully established the in vitro cardiomyocytes and in vivo mouse models of ZIKV infection to investigate the involvement of autophagy in ZIKV infection. The results showed that ZIKV infection is both time and gradient‐dependent. The key autophagy protein, LC3B, increased remarkably after ZIKV infection. Meanwhile, autophagic flux was detected by immunofluorescence. Applying autophagy inhibitors decreased the LC3B levels. Furthermore, the number of viral copies was quantified to evaluate the influence of autophagy during infection. We found that autophagy was actively involved in the ZIKV infection and the inhibition of autophagy could effectively reduce the viral copies, suggesting a potential intervention strategy for reducing ZIKV infection and the undesired complications caused by ZIKV.

TI  - Inhibition of CHK2 dependent DNA damage response suppresses Zika virus infection through a STING dependent mechanism
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes neurological disorders and microcephaly. Recent research has shown that ZIKV causes cell cycle arrest and DNA damage response in neuronal progenitor cells that potentially leads to congenital neurodevelopmental defects. However, the specific role of regulators that control DNA damage response to ZIKV infection and the related mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here through both in vitro and in vivo studies, we observe that ZIKV induces DNA damage response in both human cell line and mouse embryo. When CHK2 dependent DNA damage response pathway is inhibited by a small molecule inhibitor or genetic deletion, ZIKV production is reduced and the embryonic developmental defects are rescued. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in ZIKV infected Chk2-/- mice, the reduced viral load correlates with elevated antiviral innate immune response which is found to be dependent on the STING signaling pathway. Collectively, our study reveals a specific role of CHK2 for ZIKV infection and pathogenesis, demonstrating a mechanism that inhibition of the CHK2 axis suppresses ZIKV infection through the STING-dependent antiviral pathway, thus providing a new therapeutic strategy against ZIKV. These findings also suggest the intriguing possibility that ZIKV evolved to orchestrate DNA damage response factors to create a beneficial environment for its infection in the host cells.

AB  - TO THE EDITOR—A recent study by He et al found that interleukin 1β (IL-1β) production during Zika virus (ZIKV) infection was driven by NLRP3 inflammasome activation [1]. NLRP3 activation was mediated by ZIKV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), leading to IL-1β activation in a process also involving reactive oxygen species. This important study provides new insights into the role of IL-1β signaling in the pathogenesis of ZIKV disease and highlights a new avenue for therapeutic options.

TI  - Inhibition of innate immune response ameliorates Zika virus-induced neurogenesis deficit in human neural stem cells
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 15
AB  - Global Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks and their strong link to microcephaly have raised major public health concerns. ZIKV has been reported to affect the innate immune responses in neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs). However, it is unclear how these immune factors affect neurogenesis. In this study, we used Asian-American lineage ZIKV strain PRVABC59 to infect primary human NS/PCs originally derived from fetal brains. We found that ZIKV overactivated key molecules in the innate immune pathways to impair neurogenesis in a cell stage-dependent manner. Inhibiting the overactivated innate immune responses ameliorated ZIKV-induced neurogenesis reduction. This study thus suggests that orchestrating the host innate immune responses in NS/PCs after ZIKV infection could be promising therapeutic approach to attenuate ZIKV-associated neuropathology.

TI  - Inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase blocks Zika virus infection in mice
JF  - Communications Biology
VL  - 3
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an infectious disease that has become an important concern worldwide, it associates with neurological disorders and congenital malformations in adults, also leading to fetal intrauterine growth restriction and microcephaly during pregnancy. However, there are currently no approved vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for preventing or treating ZIKV infection. Here, we show that two FDA-approved Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors, ouabain and digoxin, can block ZIKV infection at the replication stage by targeting Na+/K+-ATPase. Furthermore, ouabain reduced the viral burden of ZIKV in adult mice, penetrated the placental barrier to enter fetal tissues, and protected fetal mice from ZIKV infection-induced microcephaly in a pregnant mouse model. Thus, ouabain has therapeutic potential for ZIKV. Guo, Jia et al. show that an FDA-approved Na + /K + - ATPase inhibitor ouabain reduces the burden of Zika virus infection in adult mice while protecting fetal mice from Zika virus infection-induced microcephaly. This study suggests ouabain’s therapeutic potential for Zika virus.

EP  - 86
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE
The link between Zika Virus (ZIKV) epidemic and neurological disorder has raised an urgent global alarm. The current epidemic of ZIKV has triggered quick responses in the scientific world. The first case of ZIKV was reported in 2015 from Brazil and now has spread over 30 countries. Nearly four hundred cases of traveler associated ZIKV infection have also been reported in the United States. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquito belonging to the genus Aedes that are widely distributed throughout the world. Additionally, the virus can also be transmitted from male to female by sexual contact. The epidemiological investigations during the current outbreak found a causal link between infection in pregnant women and the development of microcephaly (MCPH) in their unborn babies. This finding is a cause of grave concern since MCPH is a serious neural developmental disorder that can lead to significant post-natal developmental abnormalities and disabilities. Recently, published data indicates that ZIKV infection severely affects the growth of fetal neural progenitor cells and cerebral neurons resulting in malformation of cerebral cortex leading to MCPH. Recently, it has been reported that ZIKV infection deregulates the signaling pathway of neuronal cell and inhibits the neurogenesis.


CONCLUSION
In this review, we discussed the information about cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration of human neuronal cells and inhibition of neurogenesis. The provided information in this review will be very useful further not only in neuro-scientific research but also in the desig and development of management strategies for MCPH and other mosquito-borne diseases.

TI  - Inhibition of PIKFYVE kinase interferes ESCRT pathway to suppress RNA virus replication
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) is essential in the functional operation of endosomal transport in envelopment and budding of enveloped RNA viruses. However, in nonenveloped RNA viruses such as enteroviruses of the Picornaviridae family, the precise function of ESCRT pathway in viral replication remains elusive. Here, we initially evaluated that the ESCRT pathway is important for viral replication upon enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. Furthermore, we discovered that YM201636, a specific inhibitor of phosphoinositide kinase, FYVE finger containing (PIKFYVE) kinase, significantly suppressed EV71 replication and virus‐induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, YM201636 inhibits PIKFYVE kinase to block the ESCRT pathway and endosomal transport, leading to the disruption of viral entry and replication complex in subcellular components and ultimately repression of intracellular RNA virus replication and virus‐induced inflammatory responses. Further studies found that YM201636 broadly represses the replication of other RNA viruses, including coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), poliovirus 1 (PV1), echovirus 11 (E11), Zika virus (ZIKV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), rather than DNA viruses, including adenovirus 3 (ADV3) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Our findings shed light on the mechanism underlying PIKFYVE‐modulated ESCRT pathway involved in RNA virus replication, and also provide a prospective antiviral therapy during RNA viruses infections.

TI  - Inhibition of sterol O-acyltransferase 1 blocks Zika virus infection in cell lines and cerebral organoids
JF  - Communications Biology
VL  - 7
AB  - Viruses depend on host metabolic pathways and flaviviruses are specifically linked to lipid metabolism. During dengue virus infection lipid droplets are degraded to fuel replication and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection depends on triglyceride biosynthesis. Here, we systematically investigated the neutral lipid–synthesizing enzymes diacylglycerol O-acyltransferases (DGAT) and the sterol O-acyltransferase (SOAT) 1 in orthoflavivirus infection. Downregulation of DGAT1 and SOAT1 compromises ZIKV infection in hepatoma cells but only SOAT1 and not DGAT inhibitor treatment reduces ZIKV infection. DGAT1 interacts with the ZIKV capsid protein, indicating that protein interaction might be required for ZIKV replication. Importantly, inhibition of SOAT1 severely impairs ZIKV infection in neural cell culture models and cerebral organoids. SOAT1 inhibitor treatment decreases extracellular viral RNA and E protein level and lowers the specific infectivity of virions, indicating that ZIKV morphogenesis is compromised, likely due to accumulation of free cholesterol. Our findings provide insights into the importance of cholesterol and cholesterol ester balance for efficient ZIKV replication and implicate SOAT1 as an antiviral target.

TI  - Inhibition of Tryptophan Catabolism Is Associated With Neuroprotection During Zika Virus Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus belonging to Flaviviridae family that emerged as a global health threat due to its association with microcephaly and other severe neurological complications, including Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). ZIKV disease has been linked to neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death. Neurodegenerative processes may be exacerbated by metabolites produced by the kynurenine pathway, an important pathway for the degradation of tryptophan, which induces neuronal dysfunction due to enhanced excitotoxicity. Here, we exploited the hypothesis that ZIKV-induced neurodegeneration can be rescued by blocking a target enzyme of the kynurenine pathway, the Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1). RT-PCR analysis showed increased levels of IDO-1 RNA expression in undifferentiated primary neurons isolated from wild type (WT) mice infected by ZIKV ex vivo, as well as in the brain of ZIKV-infected A129 mice. Pharmacological inhibition of IDO-1 enzyme with 1-methyl-D-tryptophan (1-MT), in both in vitro and in vivo systems, led to significant reduction of ZIKV-induced neuronal death without interfering with the ability of ZIKV to replicate in those cells. Furthermore, in vivo analyses using both genetically modified mice (IDO-/- mice) and A129 mice treated with 1-MT resulted in reduced microgliosis, astrogliosis and Caspase-3 positive cells in the brain of ZIKV-infected A129 mice. Interestingly, increased levels of CCL5 and CXCL-1 chemokines were found in the brain of 1-MT treated-mice. Together, our data indicate that IDO-1 blockade provides a neuroprotective effect against ZIKV-induced neurodegeneration, and this is amenable to inhibition by pharmacological treatment.

TI  - Inhibition of type I interferon induction and signalling by mosquito‐borne flaviviruses
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 19
AB  - The Flavivirus genus (Flaviviridae family) contains a number of important human pathogens, including dengue and Zika viruses, which have the potential to cause severe disease. In order to efficiently establish a productive infection in mammalian cells, flaviviruses have developed key strategies to counteract host immune defences, including the type I interferon response. They employ different mechanisms to control interferon signal transduction and effector pathways, and key research generated over the past couple of decades has uncovered new insights into their abilities to actively decrease interferon antiviral activity. Given the lack of antivirals or prophylactic treatments for many flaviviral infections, it is important to fully understand how these viruses affect cellular processes to influence pathogenesis and disease outcome. This review will discuss the strategies mosquito‐borne flaviviruses have evolved to antagonise type I interferon mediated immune responses.

TI  - Inhibitors of the Histone Methyltransferases EZH2/1 Induce a Potent Antiviral State and Suppress Infection by Diverse Viral Pathogens
JF  - mBio
VL  - 8
AB  - ABSTRACT Epigenetic regulation is based on a network of complexes that modulate the chromatin character and structure of the genome to impact gene expression, cell fate, and development. Thus, epigenetic modulators represent novel therapeutic targets used to treat a range of diseases, including malignancies. Infectious pathogens such as herpesviruses are also regulated by cellular epigenetic machinery, and epigenetic therapeutics represent a novel approach used to control infection, persistence, and the resulting recurrent disease. The histone H3K27 methyltransferases EZH2 and EZH1 (EZH2/1) are epigenetic repressors that suppress gene transcription via propagation of repressive H3K27me3-enriched chromatin domains. However, while EZH2/1 are implicated in the repression of herpesviral gene expression, inhibitors of these enzymes suppressed primary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, these compounds blocked lytic viral replication following induction of HSV reactivation in latently infected sensory ganglia. Suppression correlated with the induction of multiple inflammatory, stress, and antipathogen pathways, as well as enhanced recruitment of immune cells to in vivo infection sites. Importantly, EZH2/1 inhibitors induced a cellular antiviral state that also suppressed infection with DNA (human cytomegalovirus, adenovirus) and RNA (Zika virus) viruses. Thus, EZH2/1 inhibitors have considerable potential as general antivirals through the activation of cellular antiviral and immune responses. IMPORTANCE A significant proportion of the world’s population is infected with herpes simplex virus. Primary infection and subsequent recurrent reactivation can result in diseases ranging from mild lesions to severe ocular or neurological damage. Herpesviruses are subject to epigenetic regulation that modulates viral gene expression, lytic replication, and latency-reactivation cycles. Thus, epigenetic pharmaceuticals have the potential to alter the course of infection and disease. Here, while the histone methyltransferases EZH2/1 are implicated in the suppression of herpesviruses, inhibitors of these repressors unexpectedly suppress viral infection in vitro and in vivo by induction of key components of cellular innate defense pathways. These inhibitors suppress infection by multiple viral pathogens, indicating their potential as broad-spectrum antivirals.

TI  - INMI1 Zika Virus NS4B Antagonizes the Interferon Signaling by Suppressing STAT1 Phosphorylation
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - The evasion of the Interferon response has important implications in Zika virus (ZIKV) disease. Mutations in ZIKV viral protein NS4B, associated with modulation of the interferon (IFN) system, have been linked to increased pathogenicity in animal models. In this study, we unravel ZIKV NS4B as antagonist of the IFN signaling cascade. Firstly, we reported the genomic characterization of NS4B isolated from a strain of the 2016 outbreak, ZIKV Brazil/2016/INMI1, and we predicted its membrane topology. Secondly, we analyzed its phylogenetic correlation with other flaviviruses, finding a high similarity with dengue virus 2 (DEN2) strains; in particular, the highest conservation was found when NS4B was aligned with the IFN inhibitory domain of DEN2 NS4B. Hence, we asked whether ZIKV NS4B was also able to inhibit the IFN signaling cascade, as reported for DEN2 NS4B. Our results showed that ZIKV NS4B was able to strongly inhibit the IFN stimulated response element and the IFN-γ-activated site transcription, blocking IFN-I/-II responses. mRNA expression levels of the IFN stimulated genes ISG15 and OAS1 were also strongly reduced in presence of NS4B. We found that the viral protein was acting by suppressing the STAT1 phosphorylation and consequently blocking the nuclear transport of both STAT1 and STAT2.

TI  - Innate Immune Antagonism of Mosquito-Borne Flaviviruses in Humans and Mosquitoes
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Mosquito-borne viruses of the Flavivirus genus (Flaviviridae family) pose an ongoing threat to global public health. For example, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses are transmitted by infected mosquitoes and cause severe and fatal diseases in humans. The means by which mosquito-borne flaviviruses establish persistent infection in mosquitoes and cause disease in humans are complex and depend upon a myriad of virus-host interactions, such as those of the innate immune system, which are the main focus of our review. This review also covers the different strategies utilized by mosquito-borne flaviviruses to antagonize the innate immune response in humans and mosquitoes. Given the lack of antiviral therapeutics for mosquito-borne flaviviruses, improving our understanding of these virus-immune interactions could lead to new antiviral therapies and strategies for developing refractory vectors incapable of transmitting these viruses, and can also provide insights into determinants of viral tropism that influence virus emergence into new species.

AB  - Flavivirus is a genus of medically important viruses, including Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Yellow Fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), etc. The global burden of these acute infection-causing viruses is ever-increasing. Primary febrile symptoms of most of these viruses can progress to hemorrhagic or neurological complications, and some like JEV, YFV have a greater than 15% mortality. The absence of antiviral therapy and highly effective vaccine candidates for these viruses highlights the need for research into virulence and immune evasion mechanisms at the molecular level. Interaction with the host needs to be carefully dissected to narrow down to a list of necessary factors for virus survival within the host. This review attempts to comprehensively compile research efforts made in the field of innate immune subversion strategies employed by the human Flaviviruses.

TI  - Innate Immunity Modulation during Zika Virus Infection on Pregnancy: What We Still Need to Know for Medical Sciences Breakthrough
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), an arthropod-borne flavivirus, was classified as reemerging infectious disease and included as neglected tropical disease. During the recent ZIKV outbreak in South America, it has been demonstrated that ZIKV infection during pregnancy is strongly associated with fetal loss, malformations and neurological disorders in newborns. Despite the first line of host immune defense is related to innate immunity activation, the immunological homeostasis is essential for pregnancy success. Although the dynamic changes in maternal-fetal immunity is not completely understood and poorly investigated, the knowledge of immune responses during gestation is very important for infectious disease prevention and control, as ZIKV. Here, we put together more and new information about the innate immunity during gestation, highlighting three parts probably involved with clinical outcome and/or not well explored in literature: 1) type III interferon; 2) innate regulatory cells; and 3) cell death pathways modulation. Additionally, we will be focused on discussing how the dynamic responses of innate immune system during pregnancy and its effects in newborns, could be modulated by ZIKV, as well as how efforts on development of new/old drugs and vaccines could be effective for ZIKV prevention and control to provide a successful pregnancy.

TI  - Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1α Promotes Zika Virus Infection through Regulation of Stearoyl Coenzyme A Desaturase 1-Mediated Lipid Metabolism
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has been linked to serious neurologic disorders and causes widespread concern in the field of global public health. Inositol requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) is an ER-related transmembrane protein that mediates unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Here, we revealed that IRE1α is a proviral factor for ZIKV replication both in culture cells and mice model, which relies on its kinase and RNase activities. Importantly, we further provided evidence that upon ZIKV infection, IRE1α is activated and splices XBP1 mRNA which enhances the expression of monounsaturated fatty acids rate-limiting enzyme stearoyl coenzyme A (stearoyl-CoA) desaturase 1 (SCD1) and subsequent lipid droplet production. Our data uncover a novel mechanism of IRE1α proviral effect by modulating lipid metabolism, providing the first evidence of a close relationship between IRE1α-mediated UPR, lipid metabolism, and ZIKV replication and indicating IRE1α inhibitors as potentially effective anti-ZIKV agents. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus which has become a global epidemic threat due to its rapid spread and association with serious consequences of infection, including neonatal microcephaly. Inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related transmembrane protein that mediates unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and has been indicated to play an important role in flavivirus replication. However, the mechanism of how IRE1α affects ZIKV replication remains unknown. In this study, we explored the role of IRE1α in ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo by using CRISPR/Cas9-based gene knockout and RNA interference-based gene knockdown techniques. Both knockout and knockdown of IRE1α dramatically reduced ZIKV replication levels, including viral RNA levels, protein expression, and titers in different human cell lines. Trans-complementation with IRE1α restored viral replication levels decreased by IRE1α depletion. Furthermore, the proviral effect of IRE1α was dependent on its kinase and RNase activities. Importantly, we found that IRE1α promoted the replication of ZIKV through upregulating the accumulation of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) rate-limiting enzyme stearoyl coenzyme A (stearoyl-CoA) desaturase 1 (SCD1), which further affected the production of oleic acid (OA) and lipid droplet. Finally, our data demonstrated that in the brain tissues of ZIKV-infected mice, the replication levels of ZIKV and virus-related lesions were significantly suppressed by both the kinase and RNase inhibitors of IRE1α. Taken together, our results identified IRE1α as a ZIKV dependency factor which promotes viral replication through affecting SCD1-mediated lipid metabolism, potentially providing a novel molecular target for the development of anti-ZIKV agents.

TI  - Insights into Structures and Dynamics of Flavivirus Proteases from NMR Studies
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 21
AB  - Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays important roles in structural biology and drug discovery, as it is a powerful tool to understand protein structures, dynamics, and ligand binding under physiological conditions. The protease of flaviviruses is an attractive target for developing antivirals because it is essential for the maturation of viral proteins. High-resolution structures of the proteases in the absence and presence of ligands/inhibitors were determined using X-ray crystallography, providing structural information for rational drug design. Structural studies suggest that proteases from Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) exist in open and closed conformations. Solution NMR studies showed that the closed conformation is predominant in solution and should be utilized in structure-based drug design. Here, we reviewed solution NMR studies of the proteases from these viruses. The accumulated studies demonstrated that NMR spectroscopy provides additional information to understand conformational changes of these proteases in the absence and presence of substrates/inhibitors. In addition, NMR spectroscopy can be used for identifying fragment hits that can be further developed into potent protease inhibitors.

VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a significant public health threat, reaching pandemic levels in 2016. Human infection with ZIKV can manifest as either asymptomatic or as an acute illness characterized by symptoms such as fever and headache. Moreover, it has been associated with severe neurological complications in adults, including Guillain–Barre syndrome, and devastating fetal abnormalities, like microcephaly. The primary mode of transmission is through Aedes spp. mosquitoes, and with half of the world’s population residing in regions where Aedes aegypti, the principal vector, thrives, the reemergence of ZIKV remains a concern. This comprehensive review provides insights into the pathogenesis of ZIKV and highlights the key cellular pathways activated upon ZIKV infection. Additionally, we explore the potential of utilizing microRNAs (miRNAs) and phytocompounds as promising strategies to combat ZIKV infection.

TI  - Integrated MicroRNA and mRNA Profiling in Zika Virus-Infected Neurons
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have caused a wide spectrum of neurological diseases, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, myelitis, meningoencephalitis, and congenital microcephaly. No effective therapies currently exist for treating patients infected with ZIKV. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small RNAs involved in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular and physiological processes. In this study, we analyzed digital miRNA and mRNA profiles in ZIKV-infected primary mouse neurons using the nCounter technology. A total of 599 miRNAs and 770 mRNAs were examined. We demonstrate that ZIKV infection causes global downregulation of miRNAs with only few upregulated miRNAs. ZIKV-modulated miRNAs including miR-155, miR-203, miR-29a, and miR-124-3p are known to play critical role in flavivirus infection, anti-viral immunity and brain injury. ZIKV infection also results in downregulation of miRNA processing enzymes. In contrast, ZIKV infection induces dramatic upregulation of anti-viral, inflammatory and apoptotic genes. Furthermore, our data demonstrate an inverse correlation between ZIKV-modulated miRNAs and target host mRNAs induced by ZIKV. Biofunctional analysis revealed that ZIKV-modulated miRNAs and mRNAs regulate the pathways related to neurological development and neuroinflammatory responses. Functional studies targeting specific miRNA are warranted to develop therapeutics for the management of ZIKV neurological disease.

JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Since its outbreak in 2007, Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a global health threat that causes severe neurological conditions. Here we perform a comparative in vivo structural analysis of the RNA genomes of two ZIKV strains to decipher the regulation of their infection at the RNA level. Our analysis identified both known and novel functional RNA structural elements. We discovered a functional long-range intramolecular interaction specific for the Asian epidemic strains, which contributes to their infectivity. Our findings illuminate the structural basis of ZIKV regulation and provide a rich resource for the discovery of RNA structural elements that are important for ZIKV infection.

TI  - Interaction of Zika Virus Envelope Protein with Glycosaminoglycans.
JF  - Biochemistry
VL  - 56 8
SP  - 1151
EP  - 1162
AB  - In February 2016, the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on Zika Virus (ZIKV), because of its association with severe fetal anomalies of congenitally infected humans. This has led to urgent efforts by academic, federal, and industry research groups to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of ZIKV and to develop detection methods, therapeutic strategies, and vaccines. Although we still do not have the entire picture of the pathogenesis of ZIKV, extensive research has been conducted on related pathogenic flaviviruses (i.e., dengue virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus). Binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) through its envelope protein is the first step in successful host cell invasion of dengue virus. In this study, we examined ZIKV envelope protein (ZIKV E) binding to GAGs in a real time interaction study using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to explore the role of GAGs in host cell entry of ZIKV into placenta and brain. ZIKV E strongly binds (KD = 443 nM) pharmaceutical heparin (HP), a highly sulfated GAG, and binds with lower avidity to less sulfated GAGs, suggesting that the ZIKV E-GAG interaction may be electrostatically driven. Using SPR competition assays with various chain length HP oligosaccharides (from 4 to 18 saccharide units in length), we observed that ZIKV E preferentially binds to longer HP oligosaccharides (with 8-18 saccharides). Next, we examined GAGs prepared from human placentas to determine if they bound ZIKV E, possibly mediating placental cell invasion of ZIKV. Compositional analysis of these GAGs as well as SPR binding studies showed that both chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate GAGs, present on the placenta, showed low-micromolar interactions with ZIKV E. Both porcine brain CS and HS also showed micromolar binding with ZIKV E. Moreover, heparan sulfate with a higher TriS content, the dominant repeating unit of HP, shows a high affinity for ZIKV E. These results suggest that GAGs may be utilized as attachment factors for host cell entry of Zika virus as they do in other pathogenic flaviviruses. They may also assist us in advancing our understanding of the pathogenesis of ZIKV and guide us in designing therapeutics to combat ZIKV with more insight.

TI  - Interactions of host miRNAs in the flavivirus 3´UTR genome: From bioinformatics predictions to practical approaches
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - The genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family includes important viruses, such as Dengue, Zika, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, Yellow fever, Saint Louis encephalitis, and Usutu viruses. They are transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks, and they can infect humans, causing fever, encephalitis, or haemorrhagic fever. The treatment resources for these diseases and the number of vaccines available are limited. It has been discovered that eukaryotic cells synthesize small RNA molecules that can bind specifically to sequences present in messenger RNAs to inhibit the translation process, thus regulating gene expression. These small RNAs have been named microRNAs, and they have an important impact on viral infections. In this review, we compiled the available information on miRNAs that can interact with the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of the flavivirus genome, a conserved region that is important for viral replication and translation.

TI  - Interference of the Zika Virus E-Protein With the Membrane Attack Complex of the Complement System
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 11
AB  - The complement system has developed different strategies to clear infections by several effector mechanisms, such as opsonization, which supports phagocytosis, attracting immune cells by C3 and C5 cleavage products, or direct killing of pathogens by the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). As the Zika virus (ZIKV) activates the classical complement pathway and thus has to avoid clearance by the complement system, we analyzed putative viral escape mechanisms, which limit virolysis. We identified binding of the recombinant viral envelope E protein to components of the terminal pathway complement (C5b6, C7, C8, and C9) by ELISA. Western blot analyses revealed that ZIKV E protein interfered with the polymerization of C9, induced on cellular surfaces, either by purified terminal complement proteins or by normal human serum (NHS) as a source of the complement. Further, the hemolytic activity of NHS was significantly reduced in the presence of the recombinant E protein or entire viral particles. This data indicates that ZIKV reduces MAC formation and complement-mediated lysis by binding terminal complement proteins to the viral E protein.

TI  - Interferon lambda protects the female reproductive tract against Zika virus infection
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 10
AB  - Although Zika virus (ZIKV) can be transmitted sexually and cause congenital birth defects, immune control mechanisms in the female reproductive tract (FRT) are not well characterized. Here we show that treatment of primary human vaginal and cervical epithelial cells with interferon (IFN)-α/β or IFN-λ induces host defense transcriptional signatures and inhibits ZIKV infection. We also assess the effects of IFNs on intravaginal infection of the FRT using ovariectomized mice treated with reproductive hormones. We find that mice receiving estradiol are protected against intravaginal ZIKV infection, independently of IFN-α/β or IFN-λ signaling. In contrast, mice lacking IFN-λ signaling sustain greater FRT infection when progesterone is administered. Exogenous IFN-λ treatment confers an antiviral effect when mice receive both estradiol and progesterone, but not progesterone alone. Our results identify a hormonal stage-dependent role for IFN-λ in controlling ZIKV infection in the FRT and suggest a path for minimizing sexual transmission of ZIKV in women. Zika virus infections can cause devastating congenital birth defects but the underlying interactions with the host immune system are not well understood. Here, the authors examine the immune basis of vaginal protection and susceptibility to Zika viral infection, and identify a hormonal dependent role for interferon-lambda-mediated protection against disease.

TI  - Interferon ɛ restricts Zika virus infection in the female reproductive tract
JF  - PNAS Nexus
VL  - 2
AB  - Abstract Interferon ɛ (IFNɛ) is a unique type I IFN that has been implicated in host defense against sexually transmitted infections. Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging pathogen, can infect the female reproductive tract (FRT) and cause devastating diseases, particularly in pregnant women. How IFNɛ contributes to protection against ZIKV infection in vivo is unknown. In this study, we show that IFNɛ plays a critical role in host protection against vaginal ZIKV infection in mice. We found that IFNɛ was expressed not only by epithelial cells in the FRT but also by immune and stromal cells at baseline or after exposure to viruses or specific Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. IFNɛ-deficient mice exhibited abnormalities in the epithelial border and underlying tissue in the cervicovaginal tract, and these defects were associated with increased susceptibility to vaginal but not subcutaneous ZIKV infection. IFNɛ deficiency resulted in an increase in magnitude, duration, and depth of ZIKV infection in the FRT. Critically, intravaginal administration of recombinant IFNɛ protected Ifnɛ−/− mice and highly susceptible Ifnar1−/− mice against vaginal ZIKV infection, indicating that IFNɛ was sufficient to provide protection even in the absence of signals from other type I IFNs and in an IFNAR1-independent manner. Our findings reveal a potentially critical role for IFNɛ in mediating protection against the transmission of ZIKV in the context of sexual contact.

TI  - Interferon-dependent R-loop induction by Zika virus contributes to growth attenuation
JF  - PNAS Nexus
VL  - 4
AB  - Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in human neural progenitors triggers DNA damage and activates DNA damage response, leading to cell cycle arrest that can retard brain development. Here, we link the ZIKV-induced S phase arrest to replication fork stalling and R-loop induction. DRIP-seq reveals that ZIKV infection induces R loops at specific loci strongly enriched in the interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs). Bromouridine sequencing results further indicate that nascent ISGs transcripts are prone to R-loop induction upon infection. Knockout of IFN receptor eliminated the R loops on ISGs and partially rescued S-phase arrest in infected cells. And overexpression of RNaseH1 reduced ZIKV-mediated DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. We conclude that unscheduled expression of ISGs induced by ZIKV alters R-loop homeostasis and perturbs replication fork progression, leading to fork stalling and eventually DNA damage. IFN-dependent R-loop induction represents a previously unknown, nucleic acid–based mechanism for cell cycle arrest.

TI  - Interferon-inducible protein (IFI) 16 regulates Chikungunya and Zika virus infection in human skin fibroblasts
JF  - EXCLI Journal
VL  - 18
SP  - 467
EP  - 476
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a re-emerging infectious arbovirus, causes Chikungunya fever that is characterized by fever, skin rash, joint pain, arthralgia and occasionally death. Despite it has been described for 66 years already, neither potential vaccine nor a specific drug is available yet. During CHIKV infection, interferon type I signaling pathway is stimulated and releases hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Our previous study reported that IFI16, a member of ISGs, is up-regulated during CHIKV virus infection and the suppression of the gene resulted in increased virus replication. Furthermore, our group also found that inflammasome activation can inhibit CHIKV infection in human foreskin cells (HFF1). Concomitantly, it has been reported that IFI16 activates the inflammasome to suppress virus infection. Therefore, we have hypothesized that IFI16 could be involved in CHIKV infection. In this study, we confirmed the expression level of IFI16 by Western blotting analysis and found that IFI16 was up-regulated following CHIKV infection in both HFF1 and human embryonic kidney cells. We next investigated its antiviral activity and found that forced expression of IFI16 completely restricted CHIKV infection while endogenous silencing of the gene markedly increased virus replication. Furthermore, we have discovered that IFI16 inhibited CHIKV replication, at least, in cell-to-cell transmission as well as the diffusion step. Interestingly, IFI16 also exerted its antiviral activity against Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, the global threat re-emerging virus can cause microcephaly in humans. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence of an antivirus activity of IFI16 during in vitro arbovirus infection, thus expanding its antiviral spectrum that paves the way to further development of antiviral drugs and vaccines.

TI  - Interplay between Inflammation and Cellular Stress Triggered by Flaviviridae Viruses
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 7
AB  - The Flaviviridae family comprises several human pathogens, including Dengue, Zika, Yellow Fever, West Nile, Japanese Encephalitis viruses, and Hepatitis C Virus. Those are enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses, which replicate mostly in intracellular compartments associated to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex. Virus replication results in abundant viral RNAs and proteins, which are recognized by cellular mechanisms evolved to prevent virus infection, resulting in inflammation and stress responses. Virus RNA molecules are sensed by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RIG-I and MDA5) and RNA-dependent protein kinases (PKR), inducing the production of inflammatory mediators and interferons. Simultaneously, the synthesis of virus RNA and proteins are distinguished in different compartments such as mitochondria, ER and cytoplasmic granules, triggering intracellular stress pathways, including oxidative stress, unfolded protein response pathway, and stress granules assembly. Here, we review the new findings that connect the inflammatory pathways to cellular stress sensors and the strategies of Flaviviridae members to counteract these cellular mechanisms and escape immune response.

JF  - Chinese Science Bulletin
VL  - 63

EP  - 501
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that is mainly transmitted by mosquito biting. ZIKV belongs to the family Flaviviridae , genus Flavivirus , which includes other important human pathogens including dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. ZIKV was first isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. Following the outbreak of ZIKV in Yap Island of Micronesia in 2007 and the largest Zika pandemic in Brazil in 2015, ZIKV has rapidly spread through the Pacific islands and the Americas, resulting in an estimated two million infections per year. Due to its unexpected causal link to microcephaly in fetus and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults, the current ongoing ZIKV epidemic was declared as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization in February, 2016. Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that ZIKV preferentially targets human neuronal progenitor cells, disrupts proliferation and differentiation, and triggers a strong immune response, resulting in significant neuronal cell death and microcephaly phenotype. Currently, no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs are available to prevent or treat ZIKV infections. Upon ZIKV infection, host cells immediately initiate several lines of antiviral innate immune responses, including the production of type I interferon (IFN) and its downstream signaling pathways. Type I IFN response is well evidenced to play a critical role during ZIKV infection, and mice deficient in type I IFN receptor are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection upon various injection routes. Type I IFN and its downstream signaling molecules (e.g. IFITM1 and IFITM3) show significant anti-ZIKV effects in both cell culture and animal models. Meanwhile, ZIKV has evolved diverse strategies to antagonize the host defense system through blocking the production of type I IFN and its downstream signaling, or escaping from antiviral effects of individual ISGs. Like other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, the viral proteins NS2B, NS3, NS4B and NS5, as well as the subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), have been identified as potent suppressors of type I IFN induction and its effector pathways. Especially, ZIKV NS5 directly binds to STAT2, and leads to the proteasomal degradation of STAT2, resulting in the silencing of type I IFN signaling. These remarkable achievements in recent two years not only lead to the better understanding of ZIKV infection and pathogenesis, but also provide useful clues for the development of antiviral drugs and vaccine candidates. Several ISGs and their enzymatic products, including 25-Hydroxycholesterol, have been well characterized with potent anti-ZIKV activity. A few recombinant live-attenuated ZIKV vaccine candidates have been rationally constructed via reverse genetics with increased IFN sensitivity, which attributed to the attenuation phenotype in immunocompetent animals. Here, we summarize recent advances in the interplay between ZIKV and host type I IFN-mediated immune response.

TI  - Interplay between Zika Virus and Peroxisomes during Infection
JF  - Cells
VL  - 8
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as an important human pathogen that can cause congenital defects in the fetus and neurological conditions in adults. The interferon (IFN) system has proven crucial in restricting ZIKV replication and pathogenesis. The canonical IFN response is triggered by the detection of viral RNA through RIG-I like receptors followed by activation of the adaptor protein MAVS on mitochondrial membranes. Recent studies have shown that a second organelle, peroxisomes, also function as a signaling platforms for the IFN response. Here, we investigated how ZIKV infection affects peroxisome biogenesis and antiviral signaling. We show that ZIKV infection depletes peroxisomes in human fetal astrocytes, a brain cell type that can support persistent infection. The peroxisome biogenesis factor PEX11B was shown to inhibit ZIKV replication, likely by increasing peroxisome numbers and enhancing downstream IFN-dependent antiviral signaling. Given that peroxisomes play critical roles in brain development and nerve function, our studies provide important insights into the roles of peroxisomes in regulating ZIKV infection and potentially neuropathogenesis.

TI  - Interplay Between Zika Virus-Induced Autophagy and Neural Stem Cell Fate Determination.
JF  - Molecular neurobiology
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks and its co-relation with microcephaly have become a global health concern. It is primarily transmitted by a mosquito, but can also be transmitted from an infected mother to her fetus causing impairment in brain development, leading to microcephaly. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of ZIKV-induced microcephaly is poorly understood. In this study, we explored the role of ZIKV non-structural protein NS4A and NS4B in ZIKV pathogenesis in a well-characterized primary culture of human fetal neural stem cells (fNSCs). We observed that the co-transfection of NS4A and NS4B altered the neural stem cell fate by arresting proliferation and inducing premature neurogenesis. NS4A + NS4B transfection in fNSCs increased autophagy and dysregulated notch signaling. Further, it also altered the regulation of downstream genes controlling cell proliferation. Additionally, we reported that 3 methyl-adenine (3-MA), a potent autophagy inhibitor, attenuated the deleterious effects of NS4A and NS4B as evidenced by the rescue in Notch1 expression, enhanced proliferation, and reduced premature neurogenesis. Our attempts to understand the mechanism of autophagy induction indicate the involvement of mitochondrial fission and ROS. Collectively, our findings highlight the novel role of NS4A and NS4B in mediating NSC fate alteration through autophagy-mediated notch degradation. The study also helps to advance our understanding of ZIKV-induced neuropathogenesis and suggests autophagy as a potential target for anti-ZIKV therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Interspecies Isobaric Labeling-Based Quantitative Proteomics Reveals Protein Changes in the Ovary of Aedes aegypti Coinfected With ZIKV and Wolbachia
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Zika is a vector-borne disease caused by an arbovirus (ZIKV) and overwhelmingly transmitted by Ae. aegypti. This disease is linked to adverse fetal outcomes, mostly microcephaly in newborns, and other clinical aspects such as acute febrile illness and neurologic complications, for example, Guillain-Barré syndrome. One of the actual most promising strategies to mitigate arbovirus transmission involves releasing Ae. aegypti mosquitoes carrying the maternally inherited endosymbiont bacteria Wolbachia pipientis. The presence of Wolbachia is associated with a reduced susceptibility to arboviruses and a fitness cost in mosquito life-history traits as fecundity and fertility. However, the mechanisms by which Wolbachia influences metabolic pathways leading to differences in egg production remains poorly known. To investigate the impact of co-infections on the reproductive tract of the mosquito, we applied an isobaric labeling-based quantitative proteomic strategy to investigate the influence of Wolbachia wMel and ZIKV infection in Ae. aegypti ovaries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most complete proteome of Ae. aegypti ovaries reported so far, with a total of 3,913 proteins identified, also,were able to quantify a total of 1,044 Wolbachia proteins in complex sample tissue of Ae. aegypti ovary.. Furthermore, we discuss proteins and pathways altered in Ae. aegypti during ZIKV infections, Wolbachia infections, co-infection Wolbachia/ZIKV, and compared with no infection, focusing on immune and reproductive aspects of Ae. aegypti. The modified aspects were mostly related to the immune priming enhancement by Wolbachia presence and the modulation of the Juvenile Hormone pathway caused by both microorganisms infection. Highlights Proteome changes in Ae. aegypti, Wolbachia, and ZIKV interactions A great diversity of Wolbachia proteins were quantified in Ae. aegypti ovary Juvenile Hormone pathway is modulated by both infections Wolbachia enhances Ae. aegypti immune priming mechanism ZIKV unsettles host immune response by reducing antimicrobial peptides production Coinfection triggers oxidative stress and a lack of vitellogenin precursors

TI  - Intracellular Interactions Between Arboviruses and Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Aedes aegypti is inherently susceptible to arboviruses. The geographical expansion of this vector host species has led to the persistence of Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya human infections. These viruses take advantage of the mosquito’s cell to create an environment conducive for their growth. Arboviral infection triggers transcriptomic and protein dysregulation in Ae. aegypti and in effect, host antiviral mechanisms are compromised. Currently, there are no existing vaccines able to protect human hosts from these infections and thus, vector control strategies such as Wolbachia mass release program is regarded as a viable option. Considerable evidence demonstrates how the presence of Wolbachia interferes with arboviruses by decreasing host cytoskeletal proteins and lipids essential for arboviral infection. Also, Wolbachia strengthens host immunity, cellular regeneration and causes the expression of microRNAs which could potentially be involved in virus inhibition. However, variation in the magnitude of Wolbachia’s pathogen blocking effect that is not due to the endosymbiont’s density has been recently reported. Furthermore, the cellular mechanisms involved in this phenotype differs depending on Wolbachia strain and host species. This prompts the need to explore the cellular interactions between Ae. aegypti-arboviruses-Wolbachia and how different Wolbachia strains overall affect the mosquito’s cell. Understanding what happens at the cellular and molecular level will provide evidence on the sustainability of Wolbachia vector control.

TI  - Intracellular translocation of HMGB1 is important for Zika virus replication in Huh7 cells
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 12
AB  - Neonatal microcephaly and adult Guillain–Barré syndrome are severe complications of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. The robustly induced inflammatory cytokine expressions in ZIKV-infected patients may constitute a hallmark for severe disease. In the present study, the potential role of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) in ZIKV infection was investigated. HMGB1 protein expression was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot assay. HMGB1’s role in ZIKV infection was also explored using treatment with dexamethasone, an immunomodulatory drug, and HMGB1-knockdown (shHMGB1) Huh7 cells. Results showed that the Huh7 cells were highly susceptible to ZIKV infection. The infection was found to induce HMGB1 nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation, resulting in a > 99% increase in the cytosolic HMGB1 expression at 72-h post-infection (h.p.i). The extracellular HMGB1 level was elevated in a time- and multiplicity of infection (MOI)-dependent manner. Treatment of the ZIKV-infected cells with dexamethasone (150 µM) reduced HMGB1 extracellular release in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximum reduction of 71 ± 5.84% (P < 0.01). The treatment also reduced virus titers by over 83 ± 0.50% (P < 0.01). The antiviral effects, however, were not observed in the dexamethasone-treated shHMGB1 cells. These results suggest that translocation of HMGB1 occurred during ZIKV infection and inhibition of the translocation by dexamethasone coincided with a reduction in ZIKV replication. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the localization of HMGB1 in affecting ZIKV infection.

TI  - Intricacy of Mitochondrial Dynamics and Antiviral Response During RNA Virus Infection
VL  - 2
AB  - Viruses are known to hijack the intracellular organelles, including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, lipid droplets, and cytoskeleton to promote its replication. The host responds to invading viruses by mounting antiviral responses and rearrangement of its organelles. In particular, the mitochondria are one of the target organelles exploited by viruses and their proteins to suppress the host antiviral response. In this review, we have comprehensively summarized the impact of mitochondrial dynamics in modulating antiviral response during emerging and re-emerging RNA virus infections caused by genus Flavivirus (Dengue virus, Zika virus, Hepatitis C virus), and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to knowledge gaps in mitochondria-virus interaction studies, we discuss recent advancements in therapeutics regulating the mitochondrial dynamics to combat viral infections.

TI  - Intrinsic features of Zika Virus non-structural proteins NS2A and NS4A in the regulation of viral replication
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 16
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and can cause neurodevelopmental disorders in fetus. As a neurotropic virus, ZIKV persistently infects neural tissues during pregnancy but the viral pathogenesis remains largely unknown. ZIKV has a positive-sense and single-stranded RNA genome, which encodes 7 non-structural (NS) proteins, participating in viral replication and dysregulation of host immunity. Like those in many other viruses, NS proteins are considered to be products evolutionarily beneficiary to viruses and some are virulence factors. However, we found that some NS proteins encoded by ZIKV genome appeared to function against the viral replication. In this report we showed that exogenously expressed ZIKV NS2A and NS4A inhibited ZIKV infection by inhibiting viral RNA replication in microglial cells and astrocytes. To understand how viral NS proteins suppressed viral replication, we analyzed the transcriptome of the microglial cells and astrocytes and found that expression of NS4A induced the upregulation of ISGs, including MX1/2, OAS1/2/3, IFITM1, IFIT1, IFI6, IFI27, ISG15 or BST2 through activating the ISGF3 signaling pathway. Upregulation of these ISGs seemed to be related to the inhibition of ZIKV replication, since the anti-ZIKV function of NS4A was partially attenuated when the cells were treated with Abrocitinib, an inhibitor of the ISGF3 signaling pathway, or were knocked down with STAT2. Aborting the protein expression of NS4A, but not its nucleic acid, eliminated the antiviral activity of NS4A effectively. Dynamic expression of viral NS proteins was examined in ZIKV-infected microglial cells and astrocytes, which showed comparatively NS4A occurred later than other NS proteins during the infection. We hypothesize that NS4A may possess intrinsic features to serve as a unique type of pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP), detectable by the cells to induce an innate immune response, or function with other mechanisms, to restrict the viral replication to a certain level as a negative feedback, which may help ZIKV maintain its persistent infection in fetal neural tissues.

TI  - Intrinsically Disordered Side of the Zika Virus Proteome
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 6
AB  - Over the last few decades, concepts of protein intrinsic disorder have been implicated in different biological processes. Recent studies have suggested that intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) provide structural plasticity and functional diversity to viral proteins that are involved in rapid replication and immune evasion in host cells. In case of Zika virus, the roles of protein intrinsic disorder in mechanisms of pathogenesis are not completely understood. In this study, we have analyzed the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in Zika virus proteome (strain MR 766). Our analyses revealed that Zika virus polyprotein is enriched with intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) and this finding is consistent with previous reports on the involvement of IDPs in shell formation and virulence of the Flaviviridae family. We found abundant IDPRs in Capsid, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, and NS5 proteins that are involved in mature particle formation and replication. In our view, the intrinsic disorder-focused analysis of ZIKV proteins could be important for the development of disorder-based drugs.

TI  - Investigating the conformational dynamics of Zika virus NS4B protein
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) NS4B protein is a membranotropic protein having multifunctional roles such as evasion of host-immune system, and induction of host membrane rearrangement for viral genome replication and processing of polyprotein. Despite its versatile functioning, its topology and dynamics are not entirely understood. Presently, there is no NMR or X-ray crystallography-based structure available for any flaviviral NS4B protein. Therefore, in this study, we have investigated the structural dynamics of Zika Virus NS4B protein through 3D structure models using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations approach and experiments. Subsequently, we employed a reductionist approach to understand the dynamics of ZIKV NS4B protein. For this, we studied its N-terminal (residues 1-38), C-terminal (residues 194-251), and cytosolic (residues 131-169) regions in isolation. Further, we have performed experiments to prove the maximum dynamics in its cytosolic region. Using a combination of computational tools and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, we validate the cytosolic region as an intrinsically disordered protein region (IDR). The microsecond-long all atoms molecular dynamics and replica-exchange MD simulations complement the experimental observations. We have also analysed its behaviour under the influence of differently charged liposomes and macromolecular crowding agents which may have significance on its overall dynamics. Lastly, we have proposed a ZIKV NS4B protein model illustrating its putative topology consisting of various membrane-spanning and non-membranous regions. Highlights Microsecond simulations of NS4B N-terminus and cytosolic regions exposed their dynamic nature. C-terminal region remains intact in presence lipid bilayer during 1 μs simulations. Spectroscopic results also reveal the cytosolic region as an intrinsically disordered region. Cytosolic region exhibits gain-of-structure property under helix inducing solvents.

TI  - Investigating the folding dynamics of NS2B protein of Zika virus
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - NS2B protein of the Zika virus acts as a co-factor for NS3 protease where only the cytosolic domain of NS2B is sufficient for the protease activity. At the same time, NS2B also involves in remodeling the NS3 protease structure. In isolation, we previously proved the NS2B cytosolic domain (residues 49-95) as a disordered type peptide conformation. Further, this study investigated the overall dynamics of NS2B full-length protein. Our Alphafold2 structure modeling system revealed surprising similarities between selected flavivirus NS2B proteins. This similarity reflects that the NS2B protein across flavivirus is conserved fold-wise. The MD simulation of Zika virus NS2B full-length protein shows that the cytosolic domain as a part of full-length protein is a disorder region supporting our previous experimental finding, which suggests the disordered nature of the cytosolic domain in isolation. Since the cytosolic domain of NS2B is essential for protease activity, we have also investigated the folding and dynamics of the NS2B cytosolic domain (residues 49-95) that shows the disorder to alpha helix transition in TFE. On the other hand, in the presence of SDS, macromolecular crowder like ficoll and PEG do not induce secondary structural change. This dynamics study could have implications for some unknown folds of the NS2B protein.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a human teratogen that causes congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). AXL, TLR3, and STAT2 are proteins involved in the ZIKV's entry into cells (AXL) and host's immune response (TLR3 and STAT2). In this study, we evaluated the role of genetic polymorphisms in these three genes as risk factors to CZS, and highlighted which proteins that interact with them could be important for ZIKV infection and teratogenesis.

TI  - IP-10 and CXCR3 signaling inhibit Zika virus replication in human prostate cells.
JF  - PloS one
VL  - 15 12
SP  - e0244587
EP  - 
AB  - Our previous studies have shown that Zika virus (ZIKV) replicates in human prostate cells, suggesting that the prostate may serve as a long-term reservoir for virus transmission. Here, we demonstrated that the innate immune responses generated to three distinct ZIKV strains (all isolated from human serum) were significantly different and dependent on their passage history (in mosquito, monkey, or human cells). In addition, some of these phenotypic differences were reduced by a single additional cell culture passage, suggesting that viruses that have been passaged more than 3 times from the patient sample will no longer reflect natural phenotypes. Two of the ZIKV strains analyzed induced high levels of the IP-10 chemokine and IFNγ in human prostate epithelial and stromal mesenchymal stem cells. To further understand the importance of these innate responses on ZIKV replication, we measured the effects of IP-10 and its downstream receptor, CXCR3, on RNA and virus production in prostate cells. Treatment with IP-10, CXCR3 agonist, or CXCR3 antagonist significantly altered ZIKV viral gene expression, depending on their passage in cells of relevant hosts (mosquito or human). We detected differences in gene expression of two primary CXCR3 isoforms (CXCR3-A and CXCR3-B) on the two cell types, possibly explaining differences in viral output. Lastly, we examined the effects of IP-10, agonist, or antagonist on cell death and proliferation under physiologically relevant infection rates, and detected no significant differences. Although we did not measure protein expression directly, our results indicate that CXCR3 signaling may be a target for therapeutics, to ultimately stop sexual transmission of this virus.

TI  - IRE1α Promotes Zika Virus Infection via XBP1
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emergent member of the Flaviviridae family which causes severe congenital defects and other major sequelae, but the cellular processes that support ZIKV replication are incompletely understood. Related flaviviruses use the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a membranous platform for viral replication and induce ER stress during infection. Our data suggest that ZIKV activates IRE1α, a component of the cellular response to ER stress. IRE1α is an ER-resident transmembrane protein that possesses a cytosolic RNase domain. Upon activation, IRE1α initiates nonconventional cytoplasmic splicing of XBP1 mRNA. Spliced XBP1 encodes a transcription factor, which upregulates ER-related targets. We find that ZIKV infection induces XBP1 mRNA splicing and induction of XBP1 target genes. Small molecule inhibitors of IRE1α, including those specific for the nuclease function, prevent ZIKV-induced cytotoxicity, as does genetic disruption of IRE1α. Optimal ZIKV RNA replication requires both IRE1α and XBP1. Spliced XBP1 has been described to cause ER expansion and remodeling and we find that ER redistribution during ZIKV infection requires IRE1α nuclease activity. Finally, we demonstrate that inducible genetic disruption of IRE1α and XBP1 impairs ZIKV replication in a mouse model of infection. Together, our data indicate that the ER stress response component IRE1α promotes ZIKV infection via XBP1 and may represent a potential therapeutic target.

TI  - IRF2 inhibits ZIKV replication by promoting FAM111A expression to enhance the host restriction effect of RFC3
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 18
AB  - Although interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) was reported to stimulate virus replication by suppressing the type I interferon signaling pathway, because cell cycle arrest was found to promote viral replication, IRF2-regulated replication fork factor (FAM111A and RFC3) might be able to affect ZIKV replication. In this study, we aimed to investigate the function of IRF2, FAM111A and RFC3 to ZIKV replication and underlying mechanism. siIRF2, siFAM111A, siRFC3 and pIRF2 in ZIKV-infected A549, 2FTGH and U5A cells were used to explore the mechanism of IRF2 to inhibit ZIKV replication. In addition, their expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR and western blots, respectively. In this study, we found IRF2 expression was increased in ZIKV-infected A549 cells and IRF2 inhibited ZIKV replication independent of type I IFN signaling pathway. IRF2 could activate FAM111A expression and then enhanced the host restriction effect of RFC3 to inhibit replication of ZIKV. We speculated the type I interferon signaling pathway might not play a leading role in regulating ZIKV replication in IRF2-silenced cells. We found IRF2 was able to upregulate FAM111A expression and thus enhance the host restriction effect of RFC3 on ZIKV.

TI  - Isarubrolone C Promotes Autophagic Degradation of Virus Proteins via Activating ATG10S in HepG2 Cells.
JF  - Journal of natural products
AB  - Isarubrolone C is a bioactive polycyclic tropoloalkaloid from Streptomyces. Our previous study showed that isarubrolone C could trigger autophagy. Here, we report isarubrolone C potential in broad-spectrum antiviral effect and its antiviral mechanism in vitro. Our results show that isarubrolone C activated autophagy and reduced levels of viral proteins in the cells harboring HCV-CORE/NS5B, HBx, ZIKV-NS5, and HIV-RT, respectively. The role of isarubrolone C in suppression of the viral proteins was via an autophagic degradation pathway rather than a proteasome pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that isarubrolone C promoted both autophagy flux opening and the viral proteins being enwrapped in autolysosomes. PCR assays showed that isarubrolone C elevated the transcription levels of ATG10/ATG10S and IL28A. Further, ATG10S high expression could efficiently enhance IL28A expression and the ability of isarubrolone C to degrade the viral proteins by promoting the colocalization of viral proteins with autolysosomes. Additionally, knockdown of endogenous IL28A caused both losses of the isarubrolone C antiviral effect and autolysosome formation. These results indicate that the role of isarubrolone C antiviruses is achieved by triggering the autophagic mechanism, which is mediated by endogenous ATG10S and IL28A activation. This is the first report about isarubrolone C potential of in vitro broad-spectrum antiviruses.

TI  - ISG15/USP18/STAT2 is a molecular hub regulating IFN I-mediated control of Dengue and Zika virus replication
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 15
AB  - The establishment of a virus infection is the result of the pathogen's ability to replicate in a hostile environment generated by the host's immune system. Here, we found that ISG15 restricts Dengue and Zika viruses' replication through the stabilization of its binding partner USP18. ISG15 expression was necessary to control DV replication driven by both autocrine and paracrine type one interferon (IFN-I) signaling. Moreover, USP18 competes with NS5-mediated STAT2 degradation, a major mechanism for establishment of flavivirus infection. Strikingly, reconstitution of USP18 in ISG15-deficient cells was sufficient to restore the STAT2's stability and restrict virus growth, suggesting that the IFNAR-mediated ISG15 activity is also antiviral. Our results add a novel layer of complexity in the virus/host interaction interface and suggest that NS5 has a narrow window of opportunity to degrade STAT2, therefore suppressing host's IFN-I mediated response and promoting virus replication.

TI  - ITGB4/CD104 mediates zika virus attachment and infection
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 15
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can result in a birth defect of the brain called microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. ZIKV enters the susceptible host cells by endocytosis, which is mediated by the interaction of the envelope (E) glycoprotein with cellular surface receptor molecules. However, the cellular factors that used by the ZIKV to gain access to host cells remains elusive. Here, we report that the extracellular domain of integrin beta 4 (ITGB4) is an entry factor of ZIKV. ITGB4 mediates ZIKV infection by directly interacting with the E glycoprotein of ZIKV, and ITGB4 knockout hampers the binding and replication of ZIKV to host cells. A functional monoclonal antibody against ITGB4 or the soluble forms of ITGB4 could decrease the binding and infection of ZIKV to permissive cell lines. Importantly, the ITGB4 antibody blocks the infection of ZIKV to mouse placenta, thus protecting the fetuses from ZIKV infection. Together, our study has demonstrated that ZIKV infection involves ITGB4 dependent binding.

TI  - Ivermectin Inhibits Zika Virus Replication in Vitro But Does Not Prevent Zika Virus Infection in Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta)

VL  - 112

AB  - ABSTRACT. Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks occur sporadically in tropical and subtropical regions. At present, there are no licensed vaccines or specific treatments available for ZIKV. Ivermectin is approved for use in humans as an antiparasitic drug. In this study, we conducted in vitro cell culture and in vivo experiments in rhesus macaque hosts and Aedes aegypti vectors to investigate the potential of ivermectin as an inhibitor of ZIKV infection. In LLC-MK2 mammalian cells, ivermectin inhibited ZIKV growth in vitro with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in the ranges of 7.4–21.3 µM and 4.0–11.6 µM for African and Asian genotypes, respectively. In C6/36 mosquito cells, ivermectin inhibited ZIKV growth in vitro with IC50 values in the ranges of 10.1–17.4 µM and 8.0–15.6 µM for the African and Asian genotypes, respectively. Despite these in vitro results, high-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (1.2 mg/kg for 3 consecutive days) failed to prevent ZIKV infection in rhesus macaque and did not alter ZIKV IgM antibody production. The secondary transfer of ivermectin from nonhuman primate blood to mosquito vectors at 3 days post-ZIKV inoculation and after the last dose of ivermectin administration showed no reduction in ZIKV replication in mosquitoes. However, mosquito survival rates were significantly (P <0.0001) lower after exposure to ivermectin, thereby potentially impacting ZIKV transmission through increased vector mortality. However, further investigation is needed to determine dosing regimens that may realize these effects in vivo.

TI  - Ivermectin: a systematic review from antiviral effects to COVID-19 complementary regimen
JF  - The Journal of Antibiotics
VL  - 73
SP  - 593
EP  - 602
AB  - Ivermectin proposes many potentials effects to treat a range of diseases, with its antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-cancer properties as a wonder drug. It is highly effective against many microorganisms including some viruses. In this comprehensive systematic review, antiviral effects of ivermectin are summarized including in vitro and in vivo studies over the past 50 years. Several studies reported antiviral effects of ivermectin on RNA viruses such as Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Hendra, Newcastle, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, chikungunya, Semliki Forest, Sindbis, Avian influenza A, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, Human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Furthermore, there are some studies showing antiviral effects of ivermectin against DNA viruses such as Equine herpes type 1, BK polyomavirus, pseudorabies, porcine circovirus 2, and bovine herpesvirus 1. Ivermectin plays a role in several biological mechanisms, therefore it could serve as a potential candidate in the treatment of a wide range of viruses including COVID-19 as well as other types of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. In vivo studies of animal models revealed a broad range of antiviral effects of ivermectin, however, clinical trials are necessary to appraise the potential efficacy of ivermectin in clinical setting.

TI  - Jak Inhibitors Modulate Production of Replication-Competent Zika Virus in Human Hofbauer, Trophoblasts, and Neuroblastoma cells
JF  - Pathogens & Immunity
VL  - 2
SP  - 199
EP  - 218
AB  - Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has been implicated in causing brain deformations, birth defects, and microcephaly in fetuses, and associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome. Mechanisms responsible for transmission of ZIKV across the placenta to the fetus are incompletely understood. Herein, we define key events modulating infection in clinically relevant cells, including primary placental macrophages (human Hofbauer cells; HC), trophoblasts, and neuroblastoma cells. Consistent with previous findings, HC and trophoblasts are permissive to ZIKV infection. Decrease of interferon signaling by Jak ½ inhibition (using ruxolitinib) significantly increased ZIKV replication in HC, trophoblasts, and neuroblasts. Enhanced ZIKV production in ruxolitinib-treated HC was associated with increased expression of HLA-DR and DC-SIGN. Nucleoside analogs blocked ruxolitinib-mediated production of extracellular virus. Although low-level ZIKV infection occurred in untreated HC and trophoblasts, replicating virions were incapable of infecting naive Vero cells. These deficient virions from untreated HC have “thin-coats” suggesting an immature structure. Blocking Jak ½ signaling (with ruxolitinib) restored replication competence as virions produced under these conditions confer cytopathic effects to naive Vero cells. These data demonstrate that Jak-STAT signaling directly impacts the ability of primary placental cells to produce replication-competent virus and is a key determinant in the production of mature virions in clinically relevant cells, including HC and trophoblasts. Design of targeted agents to prevent ZIKV replication in the placenta should consider Jak ½ signaling, the impact of its block on ZIKV infection, and subsequent transmission to the fetus.

TI  - JNK pathway restricts DENV2, ZIKV and CHIKV infection by activating complement and apoptosis in mosquito salivary glands
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - Arbovirus infection of Aedes aegypti salivary glands (SGs) determines transmission. However, there is a dearth of knowledge on SG immunity. Here, we characterized SG immune response to dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses using high-throughput transcriptomics. We also describe a transcriptomic response associated to apoptosis, blood-feeding and lipid metabolism. The three viruses differentially regulate components of Toll, Immune deficiency (IMD) and c-Jun N- terminal Kinase (JNK) pathways. However, silencing of the Toll and IMD pathway components showed variable effects on SG infection by each virus. In contrast, regulation of the JNK pathway produced consistent responses in both SGs and midgut. Infection by the three viruses increased with depletion of the activator Kayak and decreased with depletion of the negative regulator Puckered. Virus-induced JNK pathway regulates the complement factor, Thioester containing protein-20 (TEP20), and the apoptosis activator, Dronc, in SGs. Individual and co-silencing of these genes demonstrate their antiviral effects and that both may function together. Co-silencing either TEP20 or Dronc with Puckered annihilates JNK pathway antiviral effect. Upon infection in SGs, TEP20 induces antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), while Dronc is required for apoptosis independently of TEP20. In conclusion, we revealed the broad antiviral function of JNK pathway in SGs and showed that it is mediated by a TEP20 complement and Dronc-induced apoptosis response. These results expand our understanding of the immune arsenal that blocks arbovirus transmission.

TI  - Juvenile hormone analog enhances Zika virus infection in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 11
AB  - In recent years, there has been a rise in the emergence of arboviruses of public health importance, including Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever viruses. Insecticide-based mosquito control has been the primary method for mitigating transmission of arboviruses. The consequences for the application of insecticides include both lethal and sublethal effects, and associated development of insecticide resistance. However, little is known about the influence on arboviral transmission. Mosquitoes with phenotypes that exhibit insecticide resistance or experience sublethal effects may be associated with altered susceptibility to arbovirus infection and transmission. Juvenile hormone analogs (JHAs) are insecticides that prevent pupa to adult molting of mosquitoes by mimicking the action of their natural juvenile hormone. Here, we examined whether the JHA pyriproxyfen interacts with ambient temperature (20 °C and 30 °C) during juvenile stages to influence life-history traits, population growth (λ'), and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in Aedes aegypti. Development time of females was lengthened at 20 °C and in the presence of JHA. Prevention of pupa to adult molting by JHA was differentially higher at elevated temperature than low temperature. Size of females was larger at 20 °C and smaller at 30 °C. Infection, disseminated infection, and transmission of ZIKV in females were enhanced by JHA at both 20 °C and 30 °C relative to the controls. These results demonstrate that mosquito life-history and vector competence parameters are strongly influenced by interactive effects of JHA and temperature. The JHA-induced enhancement of ZIKV infection in females should be a consideration when implementing JHA in vector control strategies.

TI  - Juvenile Hormone-Sensitive Ribosomal Activity Enhances Viral Replication in Aedes aegypti
JF  - mSystems
VL  - 6
AB  - Most flaviviruses are transmitted between hosts by arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes. Since therapeutics or vaccines are lacking for most mosquito-borne diseases, reducing the mosquito vector competence is an effective way to decrease disease burden. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV; Flaviviridae) is a devastating virus transmitted to humans by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The interaction of the virus with the mosquito vector is poorly known. The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated interruption or activation of immunity-related genes in the Toll, IMD, JAK-STAT, and short interfering RNA (siRNA) pathways did not affect ZIKV infection in A. aegypti. Transcriptome-based analysis indicated that most immunity-related genes were upregulated in response to ZIKV infection, including leucine-rich immune protein (LRIM) genes. Further, there was a significant increment in the ZIKV load in LRIM9-, LRIM10A-, and LIRM10B-silenced A. aegypti, suggesting their function in modulating viral infection. Further, gene function enrichment analysis revealed that viral infection increased global ribosomal activity. Silencing of RpL23 and RpL27, two ribosomal large subunit genes, increased mosquito resistance to ZIKV infection. In vitro fat body culture assay revealed that the expression of RpL23 and RpL27 was responsive to the Juvenile hormone (JH) signaling pathway. These two genes were transcriptionally regulated by JH and its receptor methoprene-tolerant (Met) complex. Silencing of Met also inhibited ZIKV infection in A. aegypti. This suggests that ZIKV enhances ribosomal activity through JH regulation to promote infection in mosquitoes. Together, these data reveal A. aegypti immune responses to ZIKV and suggest a control strategy that reduces ZIKV transmission by modulating host factors. IMPORTANCE Most flaviviruses are transmitted between hosts by arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes. Since therapeutics or vaccines are lacking for most mosquito-borne diseases, reducing the mosquito vector competence is an effective way to decrease disease burden. We used high-throughput sequencing technology to study the interaction between mosquito Aedes aegypti and ZIKV. Leucine-rich immune protein (LRIM) genes were involved in the defense in response to viral infection. In addition, RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of RpL23 and RpL27, two JH-regulated ribosomal large subunit genes, suppressed ZIKV infection in A. aegypti. These results suggest a novel control strategy that could block the transmission of ZIKV.

TI  - Key Residue in the Precursor Region of M Protein Contributes to the Neurovirulence and Neuroinvasiveness of the African Lineage of Zika Virus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 97
AB  - The suspected link of Zika virus (ZIKV) to birth defects led the World Health Organization to declare ZIKV a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. ZIKV has been identified to have two dominant phylogenetic lineages, African and Asian. ABSTRACT The Zika virus (ZIKV) represents an important global health threat due to its unusual association with congenital Zika syndrome. ZIKV strains are phylogenetically grouped into the African and Asian lineages. However, the viral determinants underlying the phenotypic differences between the lineages remain unknown. Here, multiple sequence alignment revealed a highly conserved residue at position 21 of the premembrane (prM) protein, which is glutamic acid and lysine in the Asian and African lineages, respectively. Using reverse genetics, we generated a recombinant virus carrying an E21K mutation based on the genomic backbone of the Asian lineage strain FSS13025 (termed E21K). The E21K mutation significantly increased viral replication in multiple neural cell lines with a higher ratio of M to prM production. Animal studies showed E21K exhibited increased neurovirulence in suckling mice, leading to more severe defects in mouse brains by causing more neural cell death and destruction of hippocampus integrity. Moreover, the E21K substitution enhanced neuroinvasiveness in interferon alpha/beta (IFN-α/β) receptor knockout mice, as indicated by the increased mortality, and enhanced replication in mouse brains. The global transcriptional analysis showed E21K infection profoundly altered neuron development networks and induced stronger antiviral immune response than wild type (WT) in both neural cells and mouse brains. More importantly, the reverse K21E mutation based on the genomic backbone of the African strain MR766 caused less mouse neurovirulence. Overall, our findings support the 21st residue of prM functions as a determinant for neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness of the African lineage of ZIKV. IMPORTANCE The suspected link of Zika virus (ZIKV) to birth defects led the World Health Organization to declare ZIKV a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. ZIKV has been identified to have two dominant phylogenetic lineages, African and Asian. Significant differences exist between the two lineages in terms of neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness in mice. However, the viral determinants underlying the phenotypic differences are still unknown. Here, combining reverse genetics, animal studies, and global transcriptional analysis, we provide evidence that a single E21K mutation of prM confers to the Asian lineage strain FSS130125 significantly enhanced replication in neural cell lines and more neurovirulent and neuroinvasiveness phenotypes in mice. Our findings support that the highly conserved residue at position 21 of prM functions as a determinant of neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness of the African lineage of ZIKV in mice.

TI  - Kunjin Virus, Zika Virus, and Yellow Fever Virus Infections Have Distinct Effects on the Coding Transcriptome and Proteome of Brain-Derived U87 Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely heavily on host cells for replication, and therefore dysregulate several cellular processes for their benefit. In return, host cells activate multiple signaling pathways to limit viral replication and eradicate viruses. The present study explores the complex interplay between viruses and host cells through next generation RNA sequencing as well as mass spectrometry (SILAC). Both the coding transcriptome and the proteome of human brain-derived U87 cells infected with Kunjin virus, Zika virus, or Yellow Fever virus were compared to the transcriptome and the proteome of mock-infected cells. Changes in the abundance of several hundred mRNAs and proteins were found in each infection. Moreover, the alternative splicing of hundreds of mRNAs was found to be modulated upon viral infection. Interestingly, a significant disconnect between the changes in the transcriptome and those in the proteome of infected cells was observed. These findings provide a global view of the coding transcriptome and the proteome of Flavivirus-infected cells, leading to a better comprehension of Flavivirus–host interactions.

EP  - 1807
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can cause severe neurological disorders, including Guillain–Barre syndrome and meningoencephalitis in adults and microcephaly in fetuses. Here, we reveal that laminin receptor 1 (LAMR1) is a novel host resistance factor against ZIKV infection. Mechanistically, we found that LAMR1 binds to ZIKV envelope (E) protein via its intracellular region and attenuates E protein ubiquitination through recruiting the deubiquitinase eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 5 (EIF3S5). We further found that the conserved G282 residue of E protein is essential for its interaction with LAMR1. Moreover, a G282A substitution abolished the binding of E protein to LAMR1 and inhibited LAMR1-mediated E protein deubiquitination. Together, our results indicated that LAMR1 represses ZIKV infection through binding to E protein and attenuating its ubiquitination.

TI  - Larval crowding enhances dengue virus loads in Aedes aegypti, a relationship that might increase transmission in urban environments
JF  - PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 18
AB  - Background Climate change and urbanization will alter the global distribution of disease vectors, changing the disease burden in yet unpredictable ways. Aedes aegypti is a mosquito responsible for transmitting dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses that breeds in containers associated with urban environments. We sought to understand how ambient temperature and larval densities in the immature aquatic phases determine adult life history traits and dengue virus loads post-infection. We predicted that larval crowding and high temperatures would both lead to smaller mosquitoes that might struggle to invest in an immune response and, hence, would exhibit high viral loads. Methods We first examined larval densities from urban and rural areas via a meta-analysis. We then used these data to inform a laboratory-based 2x2 design examining the interacting effects of temperature (21 vs. 26°C) and density (0.2 vs. 0.4 larvae/mL) on adult life history and dengue virus loads. Results We found that urban areas had an ~8-fold increase in larval densities compared to more rural sites. In the lab, we found that crowding had more impact on mosquito traits than temperature. Crowding led to slower development, smaller mosquitoes, less survival, lower fecundity, and higher viral loads, as predicted. The higher temperature led to faster development, reduced fecundity, and lower viral loads. The virus-reducing effect of higher temperature rearing was, however, overwhelmed by the impact of larval crowding when both factors were present. Conclusions These data reveal complex interactions between the environmental effects experienced by immature mosquitoes and adult traits. They especially highlight the importance of crowding with respect to adult viral loads. Together, these data suggest that urban environments might enhance dengue virus loads and, therefore, possibly transmission, a concerning result given the increasing rates of urbanization globally.

TI  - Late stages of the Zika virus life cycle are impaired by a selective TRPML2 agonist
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The flavivirus genus includes human pathogenic viruses such as Dengue (DENV), West Nile (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) posing a global health threat due to limited treatment options. Ion channels are crucial for various viral life cycle stages, but their potential as targets for antivirals is often not fully realized due to the lack of selective modulators. Here, we observe that the human endolysosomal cation channel TRPML2 agonist ML2-SA1 impairs the late life cycle stages of ZIKV, thus underscoring TRPML2 as a promising antiviral target. Upon treatment with ML2-SA1, levels of intracellular genomes and number of released virus particles of two different ZIKV isolates were significantly reduced. ML2-SA1-treated cells displayed enlarged vesicular structures and multivesicular bodies with ZIKV envelope protein accumulation. However, no increased ZIKV degradation in lysosomal compartments was observed. Rather, the antiviral effect of ML2-SA1 seemed to manifest by the compound’s negative impact on genome replication. Moreover, ML2-SA1 treatment also led to intracellular cholesterol accumulation. ZIKV as well as many other viruses including the Orthohepevirus Hepatitis E virus (HEV) rely on the endolysosomal system and are affected by intracellular cholesterol levels to complete their life cycle. Since we observed ML2-SA1 to also negatively impact HEV infections in vitro, this compound may harbor a broader antiviral potential through perturbing the intracellular cholesterol distribution. Besides underscoring the potential of TRPML2 as a promising target for combatting viral infections, we uncover a tentative connection between this protein and cholesterol distribution within the context of infectious diseases.

TI  - Leu-to-Phe substitution at prM146 decreases the growth ability of Zika virus and partially reduces its pathogenicity in mice
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes febrile illness. The recent spread of ZIKV from Asia to the Americas via the Pacific region has revealed unprecedented features of ZIKV, including transplacental congenital infection causing microcephaly. Amino acid changes have been hypothesized to underlie the spread and novel features of American ZIKV strains; however, the relationship between genetic changes and the epidemic remains controversial. A comparison of the characteristics of a Southeast Asian strain (NIID123) and an American strain (PRVABC59) revealed that the latter had a higher replication ability in cultured cells and higher virulence in mice. In this study, we aimed to identify the genetic region of ZIKV responsible for these different characteristics using reverse genetics. A chimeric NIID123 strain in which the E protein was replaced with that of PRVABC59 showed a lower growth ability than the recombinant wild-type strain. Adaptation of the chimeric NIID123 to Vero cells induced a Phe-to-Leu amino acid substitution at position 146 of the prM protein; PRVABC59 also has Leu at this position. Leu at this position was found to be responsible for the viral replication ability and partially, for the pathogenicity in mouse testes.

TI  - LGP2 directly interacts with flavivirus NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and downregulates its pre-elongation activities
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 19
AB  - LGP2 is a RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) known to bind and recognize the intermediate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during virus infection and to induce type-I interferon (IFN)-related antiviral innate immune responses. Here, we find that LGP2 inhibits Zika virus (ZIKV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) replication independent of IFN induction. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and confocal immunofluorescence data suggest that LGP2 likely colocalizes with the replication complex (RC) of ZIKV by interacting with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) NS5. We further verify that the regulatory domain (RD) of LGP2 directly interacts with RdRP of NS5 by biolayer interferometry assay. Data from in vitro RdRP assays indicate that LGP2 may inhibit polymerase activities of NS5 at pre-elongation but not elongation stages, while an RNA-binding-defective LGP2 mutant can still inhibit RdRP activities and virus replication. Taken together, our work suggests that LGP2 can inhibit flavivirus replication through direct interaction with NS5 protein and downregulates its polymerase pre-elongation activities, demonstrating a distinct role of LGP2 beyond its function in innate immune responses.

TI  - LINC08148 promotes the caveola-mediated endocytosis of Zika virus through upregulating transcription of Src
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 98
AB  - ABSTRACT Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a new group of host factors involved in viral infection. Current study identified an intergenic lncRNA, LINC08148, as a proviral factor of Zika virus (ZIKV) and Dengue virus 2 (DENV2). Knockout (KO) or silencing of LINC08148 decreases the replication of ZIKV and DENV2. LINC08148 mainly acts at the endocytosis step of ZIKV but at a later stage of DENV2. RNA-seq analysis reveals that LINC08148 knockout downregulates the transcription levels of five endocytosis-related genes including AP2B1, CHMP4C, DNM1, FCHO1, and Src. Among them, loss of Src significantly decreases the uptake of ZIKV. Trans-complementation of Src in the LINC08148KO cells largely restores the caveola-mediated endocytosis of ZIKV, indicating that the proviral effect of LINC08148 is exerted through Src. Finally, LINC08148 upregulates the Src transcription through associating with its transcription factor SP1. This work establishes an essential role of LINC08148 in the ZIKV entry, underscoring a significance of lncRNAs in the viral infection. IMPORTANCE Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), like proteins, participate in viral infection. However, functions of most lncRNAs remain unknown. In this study, we performed a functional screen based on microarray data and identified a new proviral lncRNA, LINC08148. Then, we uncovered that LINC08148 is involved in the caveola-mediated endocytosis of ZIKV, rather than the classical clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Mechanistically, LINC08148 upregulates the transcription of Src, an initiator of caveola-mediated endocytosis, through binding to its transcription factor SP1. This study identifies a new lncRNA involved in the ZIKV infection, suggesting lncRNAs and cellular proteins are closely linked and cooperate to regulate viral infection.

TI  - Lineage-dependent differences and the role of IFITM3 in the type-I interferon-induced restriction of Zika virus
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Type-I interferon (IFN-I) is an important aspect of host innate antiviral response. Recent studies have shown that IFN-I can inhibit Zika virus (ZIKV) replication and that this is mediated in part by Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3). ZIKV infections in South America have led to severe congenital syndrome in a subset of infected infants. ZIKV was first identified in Africa, where there is limited evidence for the pathogenic effects associated with the American outbreak, which is fueled by infection with Asian-lineage strains, raising the possibility that the African and Asian ZIKV lineages have distinct pathogenic properties. Given the observation that IFN-I can inhibit ZIKV replication in cell culture, we asked whether ZIKV strains differed in their susceptibility to IFN-I. There was a range of susceptibilities to IFN-I inhibition across virus strains. Virus production in A549 cells was reduced from 3-42-fold for IFNα and 63-807-fold for IFNβ across a panel of nine viruses, five from the African-lineage and four from the Asian-lineage. African-lineage ZIKV strains were more resistant to IFN-I than Asian-lineage strains, but this difference was only significant for IFNα-mediated restriction (p = 0.049). Notably, over-expression of IFITM3 at similar levels induced by IFN-I did not significantly restrict either a prototype African lineage (MR 766) or Asian lineage (PRVABC59) isolate. Moreover, knocking out IFITM3 expression did not result in a significant increase in viral replication or a diminishment of the inhibition by IFN-I. Overall, our findings show that while diverse ZIKV strains are susceptible to the antiviral effects of IFN-I, African-lineage strains are more resistant to IFNα. In addition, the majority of the IFN-I-induced inhibition of ZIKV strains cannot be explained by IFITM3, suggesting that other unknown ISGs may be the driving force of the type I IFN response against ZIKV. Author summary The innate immune system, and specifically the type-I interferon response, is a critical component of the host response against viral infections. The recent unprecedented spread and severe pathogenic features of Zika virus in the Americas have led to significant interest in characterizing features of Zika virus strains that have fueled the American outbreak. Zika virus was first identified in Africa, where there is limited evidence for the pathogenic effects associated with the American outbreak. Here, we demonstrate that African-lineage Zika virus strains are significantly more resistant to the effects of type-I interferon, and that type-I interferon-mediated restriction of Zika virus strains is not explained by the host factor Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3. This improved understanding of Zika virus-host interactions may explain certain pathogenic features of Asian-lineage Zika virus strains that have fueled the American Zika virus epidemic, and supports the search for as-yet-unidentified actors in the interferon response against Zika virus.

TI  - Lipases secreted by a gut bacterium inhibit arbovirus transmission in mosquitoes
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 18
AB  - Arboviruses are etiological agents of various severe human diseases that place a tremendous burden on global public health and the economy; compounding this issue is the fact that effective prophylactics and therapeutics are lacking for most arboviruses. Herein, we identified 2 bacterial lipases secreted by a Chromobacterium bacterium isolated from Aedes aegypti midgut, Chromobacterium antiviral effector-1 (CbAE-1) and CbAE-2, with broad-spectrum virucidal activity against mosquito-borne viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and Sindbis virus (SINV). The CbAEs potently blocked viral infection in the extracellular milieu through their lipase activity. Mechanistic studies showed that this lipase activity directly disrupted the viral envelope structure, thus inactivating infectivity. A mutation in the lipase motif of CbAE-1 fully abrogated the virucidal ability. Furthermore, CbAEs also exert lipase-dependent entomopathogenic activity in mosquitoes. The anti-arboviral and entomopathogenic properties of CbAEs render them potential candidates for the development of novel transmission control strategies against vector-borne diseases.

TI  - Lipid Droplets and Their Participation in Zika Virus Infection
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 23
AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) are highly conserved and dynamic intracellular organelles. Their functions are not limited to serving as neutral lipid reservoirs; they also participate in non-energy storage functions, such as cell lipid metabolism, protection from cell stresses, maintaining protein homeostasis, and regulating nuclear function. During a Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, the viruses hijack the LDs to provide energy and lipid sources for viral replication. The co-localization of ZIKV capsid (C) protein with LDs supports its role as a virus replication platform and a key compartment for promoting the generation of progeny virus particles. However, in view of the multiple functions of LDs, their role in ZIKV infection needs further elucidation. Here, we review the basic mechanism of LD biogenesis and biological functions and discuss how ZIKV infection utilizes these effects of LDs to facilitate virus replication, along with the future application strategy of developing new antiviral drugs based on the interaction of ZIKV with LDs.

TI  - Lipid droplets in Zika neuroinfection: Potential targets for intervention?
JF  - Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz
VL  - 118
AB  - Lipid droplets (LD) are evolutionarily conserved lipid-enriched organelles with a diverse array of cell- and stimulus-regulated proteins. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that intracellular pathogens exploit LD as energy sources, replication sites, and part of the mechanisms of immune evasion. Nevertheless, LD can also favor the host as part of the immune and inflammatory response to pathogens. The functions of LD in the central nervous system have gained great interest due to their presence in various cell types in the brain and for their suggested involvement in neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases. Only recently have the roles of LD in neuroinfections begun to be explored. Recent findings reveal that lipid remodelling and increased LD biogenesis play important roles for Zika virus (ZIKV) replication and pathogenesis in neural cells. Moreover, blocking LD formation by targeting DGAT-1 in vivo inhibited virus replication and inflammation in the brain. Therefore, targeting lipid metabolism and LD biogenesis may represent potential strategies for anti-ZIKV treatment development. Here, we review the progress in understanding LD functions in the central nervous system in the context of the host response to Zika infection.

TI  - Lipid Interactions Between Flaviviruses and Mosquito Vectors
JF  - Frontiers in Physiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses, threaten a large part of the human populations. In absence of therapeutics and effective vaccines against each flaviviruses, targeting viral metabolic requirements in mosquitoes may hold the key to new intervention strategies. Development of metabolomics in the last decade opened a new field of research: mosquito metabolomics. It is now clear that flaviviruses rely on mosquito lipids, especially phospholipids, for their cellular cycle and propagation. Here, we review the biosyntheses of, biochemical properties of and flaviviral interactions with mosquito phospholipids. Phospholipids are structural lipids with a polar headgroup and apolar acyl chains, enabling the formation of lipid bilayer that form plasma- and endomembranes. Phospholipids are mostly synthesized through the de novo pathway and remodeling cycle. Variations in headgroup and acyl chains influence phospholipid physicochemical properties and consequently the membrane behavior. Flaviviruses interact with cellular membranes at every step of their cellular cycle. Recent evidence demonstrates that flaviviruses reconfigure the phospholipidome in mosquitoes by regulating phospholipid syntheses to increase virus multiplication. Identifying the phospholipids involved and understanding how flaviviruses regulate these in mosquitoes is required to design new interventions.

TI  - Lipid Metabolism as a Source of Druggable Targets for Antiviral Discovery against Zika and Other Flaviviruses
JF  - Pharmaceuticals
VL  - 12
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that can lead to birth defects (microcephaly), ocular lesions and neurological disorders (Guillain-Barré syndrome). There is no licensed vaccine or antiviral treatment against ZIKV infection. The effort to understand the complex interactions of ZIKV with cellular networks contributes to the identification of novel host-directed antiviral (HDA) candidates. Among the cellular pathways involved in infection, lipid metabolism gains attention. In ZIKV-infected cells lipid metabolism attributed to intracellular membrane remodeling, virion morphogenesis, autophagy modulation, innate immunity and inflammation. The key roles played by the cellular structures associated with lipid metabolism, such as peroxisomes and lipid droplets, are starting to be deciphered. Consequently, there is a wide variety of lipid-related antiviral strategies that are currently under consideration, which include an inhibition of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP), the activation of adenosine-monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK), an inhibition of acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), interference with sphingolipid metabolism, blockage of intracellular cholesterol trafficking, or a treatment with cholesterol derivatives. Remarkably, most of the HDAs identified in these studies are also effective against flaviviruses other than ZIKV (West Nile virus and dengue virus), supporting their broad-spectrum effect. Considering that lipid metabolism is one of the main cellular pathways suitable for pharmacological intervention, the idea of repositioning drugs targeting lipid metabolism as antiviral candidates is gaining force.

TI  - Local-scale virome depiction supports significant differences between Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Aedes spp. comprise the primary group of mosquitoes that transmit arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses to humans, and thus these insects pose a significant burden on public health worldwide. Advancements in next-generation sequencing and metagenomics have expanded our knowledge on the richness of RNA viruses harbored by arthropods such as Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus; increasing evidence suggests that vectorial competence can be modified by the microbiome (comprising both bacteriome and virome) of mosquitoes present in endemic zones. Using an RNA-seq-based metataxonomic approach, this study determined the virome structure of field-caught Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in Medellín, Colombia, a municipality with a high incidence of mosquito-transmitted arboviruses. The two species are sympatric, but their core viromes differed considerably in richness, diversity, and abundance; the viromes were dominated by a few viruses. BLAST searches of assembled contigs suggested that at least 17 virus species (16 of which are insect-specific viruses [ISVs]) infect the Ae. aegypti population. Dengue virus 3 was detected in one sample. In Ae. albopictus, up to 11 ISVs and one plant virus were detected. Therefore, the virome composition was species-specific. The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia was identified in all Ae. albopictus samples and in some Ae. aegypti samples collected after 2017. The presence of Wolbachia sp. in Ae. aegypti was not related to significant changes in the richness, diversity, or abundance of this mosquito’s virome, although it was related to an increase in the abundance of Aedes aegypti To virus 2 (unclassified). The mitochondrial diversity of these mosquitoes suggested that the Ae. aegypti population underwent a change that started in the second half of 2017, which coincides with the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in Medellín, indicating that the population of wMel-infected mosquitoes has expanded. However, additional studies are required on the dispersal speed and intergenerational stability of wMel in Medellín and nearby areas as well as on the introgression of genetic variants in the native mosquito population.

TI  - Long non-coding RNAs regulate Aedes aegypti vector competence for Zika virus and reproduction
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 19
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical regulatory roles in various cellular and metabolic processes in mosquitoes and all other organisms studied thus far. In particular, their involvement in essential processes such as reproduction makes them potential targets for the development of novel pest control approaches. However, their function in mosquito biology remains largely unexplored. To elucidate the role of lncRNAs in mosquitoes’ reproduction and vector competence for arboviruses, we have implemented a computational and experimental pipeline to mine, screen, and characterize lncRNAs related to these two biological processes. Through analysis of publicly available Zika virus (ZIKV) infection-regulated Aedes aegypti transcriptomes, at least six lncRNAs were identified as being significantly upregulated in response to infection in various mosquito tissues. The roles of these ZIKV-regulated lncRNAs (designated Zinc1, Zinc2, Zinc3, Zinc9, Zinc10 and Zinc22), were further investigated by dsRNA-mediated silencing studies. Our results show that silencing of Zinc1, Zinc2, and Zinc22 renders mosquitoes significantly less permissive to ZIKV infection, while silencing of Zinc22 also reduces fecundity, indicating a potential role for Zinc22 in trade-offs between vector competence and reproduction. We also found that silencing of Zinc9 significantly increases fecundity but has no effect on ZIKV infection, suggesting that Zinc9 may be a negative regulator of oviposition. Our work demonstrates that some lncRNAs play host factor roles by facilitating viral infection in mosquitoes. We also show that lncRNAs can influence both mosquito reproduction and permissiveness to virus infection, two biological systems with important roles in mosquito vectorial capacity.

TI  - Long non‐coding subgenomic flavivirus RNAs have extended 3D structures and are flexible in solution
JF  - EMBO Reports
VL  - 20
AB  - Most mosquito‐borne flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), Dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV), produce long non‐coding subgenomic RNAs (sfRNAs) in infected cells that link to pathogenicity and immune evasion. Until now, the structural characterization of these lncRNAs remains limited. Here, we studied the 3D structures of individual and combined subdomains of sfRNAs, and visualized the accessible 3D conformational spaces of complete sfRNAs from DENV2, ZIKV, and WNV by small angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS) and computational modeling. The individual xrRNA1s and xrRNA2s adopt similar structures in solution as the crystal structure of ZIKV xrRNA1, and all xrRNA1‐2s form compact structures with reduced flexibility. While the DB12 of DENV2 is extended, the DB12s of ZIKV and WNV are compact due to the formation of intertwined double pseudoknots. All 3′ stem‐loops (3′SLs) share similar rod‐like structures. Complete sfRNAs are extended and sample a large conformational space in solution. Our work not only provides structural insight into the function of flavivirus sfRNAs, but also highlights strategies of visualizing other lncRNAs in solution by SAXS and computational methods.

TI  - Low expression of RNA sensors impacts Zika virus infection in the lower female reproductive tract
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 10
AB  - Innate immune responses to Zika virus (ZIKV) are dampened in the lower female reproductive tract (LFRT) compared to other tissues, but the mechanism that underlies this vulnerability is poorly understood. Using tissues from uninfected and vaginally ZIKV-infected macaques and mice, we show that low basal expression of RNA-sensing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), or their co-receptors, in the LFRT contributes to high viral replication in this tissue. In the LFRT, ZIKV sensing provides limited protection against viral replication, and the sensors are also minimally induced after vaginal infection. While IFNα/β receptor signaling offers minimal protection in the LFRT, it is required to prevent dissemination of ZIKV to other tissues, including the upper FRT. Our findings support a role for RNA-sensing PRRs in the dampened innate immunity against ZIKV in the LFRT compared to other tissues and underlie potential implications for systemic dissemination upon heterosexual transmission of ZIKV in women. Here, Khan et al. show that enhanced Zika virus replication in the lower female reproductive tract of mice and macaques associates with low expression of RNA sensing pattern recognition receptors, while IFNAR signaling may be critical in preventing viral dissemination to distal tissues.

TI  - Lyn kinase regulates egress of flaviviruses in autophagosome-derived organelles
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 11
AB  - Among the various host cellular processes that are hijacked by flaviviruses, few mechanisms have been described with regard to viral egress. Here we investigate how flaviviruses exploit Src family kinases (SFKs) for exit from infected cells. We identify Lyn as a critical component for secretion of Dengue and Zika infectious particles and their corresponding virus like particles (VLPs). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs, Lyn in particular, block virus secretion. Lyn−/− cells are impaired in virus release and are rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We establish that virus particles are secreted in two distinct populations – one as free virions and the other enclosed within membranes. Lyn is critical for the latter, which consists of proteolytically processed, infectious virus progenies within autophagosome-derived vesicles. This process depends on Ulk1, Rab GTPases and SNARE complexes implicated in secretory but not degradative autophagy and occur with significantly faster kinetics than the conventional secretory pathway. Our study reveals a previously undiscovered Lyn-dependent exit route of flaviviruses in LC3+ secretory organelles that enables them to evade circulating antibodies and might affect tissue tropism. Egress of flaviviruses and involved host pathways are not well understood. Here, the authors show that Lyn is a critical host kinase for Dengue and Zika virus egress resulting in infectious virus progenies within autophagosome-derived vesicles, which might help the virus to evade antibody responses.

TI  - Magnesium Regulates RNA Ring Dynamics and Folding in Subgenomic Flaviviral RNA.
JF  - The journal of physical chemistry. B
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses including dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and regional encephalitis produce a large amount of short subgenomic flaviviral RNAs during infection. A segment of these RNAs named as xrRNA1 features a multi-pseudoknot (PK)-associated structure, which resists the host cell enzyme (XRN1) from degrading the viral RNA. We investigate how this long-range RNA PK folds in the presence of counterions, specifically in a mix of monovalent (K+) and divalent (Mg2+) salts at physiological concentrations. In this study, we use extensive explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize the RNA ion environment of the folded RNA conformation, as determined by the crystal structure. This allowed us to identify the precise locations of various coordinated RNA-Mg2+ interactions, including inner-sphere/chelated and outer-sphere coordinated Mg2+. Given that RNA folding involves large-scale conformational changes, making it challenging to explore through classical MD simulations, we investigate the folding mechanism of xrRNA1 using an all-atom structure-based RNA model with a hybrid implicit-explicit treatment of the ion environment via the dynamic counterion condensation model, both with and without physiological Mg2+ concentration. The study reveals potential folding pathways for this xrRNA1, which is consistent with the results obtained from optical tweezer experiments. The equilibrium and free energy simulations both capture a dynamic equilibrium between the ring-open and ring-close states of the RNA, driven by a long-range PK interaction. Free energy calculations reveal that with the addition of Mg2+ ions, the equilibrium shifts more toward the ring-close state. A detailed analysis of the free energy pathways and ion-mediated contact probability map highlights the critical role of Mg2+ in bridging G50 and A33. This Mg2+-mediated connection helps form the long-range PK which in turn controls the transition between the ring-open and ring-close states. The study underscores the critical role of Mg2+ in the RNA folding transition, highlighting specific locations of Mg2+ contributing to the stabilization of long-range PK connections likely to enhance the robustness of Xrn1 resistance of flaviviral xrRNAs.

TI  - Male germ cells support long-term propagation of Zika virus
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 9
AB  - Evidence of male-to-female sexual transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) and viral RNA in semen and sperm months after infection supports a potential role for testicular cells in ZIKV propagation. Here, we demonstrate that germ cells (GCs) are most susceptible to ZIKV. We found that only GCs infected by ZIKV, but not those infected by dengue virus and yellow fever virus, produce high levels of infectious virus. This observation coincides with decreased expression of interferon-stimulated gene Ifi44l in ZIKV-infected GCs, and overexpression of Ifi44l results in reduced ZIKV production. Using primary human testicular tissue, we demonstrate that human GCs are also permissive for ZIKV infection and production. Finally, we identified berberine chloride as a potent inhibitor of ZIKV infection in both murine and human testes. Together, these studies identify a potential cellular source for propagation of ZIKV in testes and a candidate drug for preventing sexual transmission of ZIKV. Zika virus (ZIKV) can persist for months in semen and sperm. Here, the authors show that germ cells, compared to other cell types in the reproductive tract, are most susceptible to ZIKV and produce high levels of progeny virus, which coincides with decreased expression of the interferon-stimulated gene Ifi44l.

TI  - Matrix metalloproteinase 9 facilitates Zika virus invasion of the testis by modulating the integrity of the blood-testis barrier
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a unique flavivirus with high tropism to the testes. ZIKV can persist in human semen for months and can cause testicular damage in male mice. However, the mechanisms through which ZIKV enters the testes remain unclear. In this study, we revealed that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) was upregulated by ZIKV infection in cell culture and in A129 mice. Furthermore, using an in vitro Sertoli cell barrier model and MMP9-/- mice, we found that ZIKV infection directly affected the permeability of the blood-testis barrier (BTB), and knockout or inhibition of MMP9 reduced the effects of ZIKV on the Sertoli cell BTB, highlighting its role in ZIKV-induced disruption of the BTB. Interestingly, the protein levels of MMP9 were elevated by ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) in primary mouse Sertoli cells (mSCs) and other cell lines. Moreover, the interaction between NS1 and MMP9 induced the K63-linked polyubiquitination of MMP9, which enhanced the stability of MMP9. The upregulated MMP9 level led to the degradation of essential proteins involved in the maintenance of the BTB, such as tight junction proteins (TJPs) and type Ⅳ collagens. Collectively, we concluded that ZIKV infection promoted the expression of MMP9 which was further stabilized by NS1 induced K63-linked polyubiquitination to affect the TJPs/ type Ⅳ collagen network, thereby disrupting the BTB and facilitating ZIKV entry into the testes.

TI  - Mechanically stable knot formed by strand threading in Zika virus RNA confers RNase resistance
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs) from viruses prevent digestion by host exoribonucleases, creating sub-genomic viral RNAs that can enhance infection and pathogenicity. Novel knotted structures in xrRNAs are proposed to act as mechanical road-blocks to RNases. Studying an xrRNA from Zika virus with optical tweezers, we found that it was the most mechanically stable RNA structure yet observed. The knot folded by threading the 5′ end into the cleft of a Mg2+-coordinated three-helix junction before pseudoknot interactions closed a ring around it. Both the threading and pseudoknot were required to generate the extremely force-resistant knot, whose formation correlated directly with RNase resistance both in the wild-type xrRNA and a low-resistance mutant. This work clarifies the folding and mechanism of action of an important new class of RNA.

TI  - Mechanism of Immune Evasion in Mosquito-Borne Diseases
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - In recent decades, mosquito-borne illnesses have emerged as a major health burden in many tropical regions. These diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever, Zika virus infection, Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile virus infection, are transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes. These pathogens have been shown to interfere with the host’s immune system through adaptive and innate immune mechanisms, as well as the human circulatory system. Crucial immune checkpoints such as antigen presentation, T cell activation, differentiation, and proinflammatory response play a vital role in the host cell’s response to pathogenic infection. Furthermore, these immune evasions have the potential to stimulate the human immune system, resulting in other associated non-communicable diseases. This review aims to advance our understanding of mosquito-borne diseases and the immune evasion mechanisms by associated pathogens. Moreover, it highlights the adverse outcomes of mosquito-borne disease.

TI  - Mechanism through Which Retrocyclin Targets Flavivirus Multiplication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Retrocyclin is an artificially humanized circular θ-defensin peptide, containing 18 residues, previously reported to possess broad antimicrobial activity. In this study, we found that retrocyclin-101 inhibited flavivirus (ZIKV and JEV) infections. Retrocyclin-101 inhibited NS2B-NS3 serine protease activity, suggesting that the catalytic triad of the protease is the target. Moreover, retrocyclin-101 bound to the DE loop of the E protein of flavivirus, which prevented its entry. ABSTRACT Currently, there are no approved drugs for the treatment of flavivirus infection. Accordingly, we tested the inhibitory effects of the novel θ-defensin retrocyclin-101 (RC-101) against flavivirus infection and investigated the mechanism underlying the potential inhibitory effects. First, RC-101 robustly inhibited both Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infections. RC-101 exerted inhibitory effects on the entry and replication stages. Results also indicated that the nonstructural protein NS2B-NS3 serine protease might serve as a potential viral target. Furthermore, RC-101 inhibited protease activity at the micromolar level. We also demonstrated that with respect to the glycoprotein E protein of flavivirus, the DE loop of domain III (DIII), which is the receptor-binding domain of the E protein, might serve as another viral target of RC-101. Moreover, a JEV DE mutant exhibited resistance to RC-101, which was associated with deceased binding affinity of RC-101 to DIII. These findings provide a basis for the development of RC-101 as a potential candidate for the treatment of flavivirus infection.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Zika virus (ZIKV) has become an epidemic in several countries and was declared a major public health issue by the WHO. Although ZIKV infection is asymptomatic or shows mild fever-related symptoms in most people, the virus can be transmitted from a pregnant mother to the fetus, resulting in severe brain developmental abnormalities, including microcephaly. Multiple groups have identified developmental neuronal and neuronal progenitor compromise during ZIKV infection within the fetal brain, but little is known about whether ZIKV could infect human astrocytes and its effect on the developing brain. Thus, our objective was to determine astrocyte ZiKV infection in a developmental-dependent manner. Methods We analyze infection of pure cultures of astrocytes and mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes in response to ZIKV using plaque assays, confocal, and electron microscopy to identify infectivity, ZIKV accumulation and intracellular distribution as well as apoptosis and interorganelle dysfunction. Results Here, we demonstrated that ZIKV enters, infects, replicates, and accumulates in large quantities in human fetal astrocytes in a developmental-dependent manner. Astrocyte infection and intracellular viral accumulation resulted in neuronal apoptosis, and we propose astrocytes are a ZIKV reservoir during brain development. Conclusions Our data identify astrocytes in different stages of development as major contributors to the devastating effects of ZIKV in the developing brain.

TI  - Mechanistic Insights into Zika Virus NS3 Helicase Inhibition by Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate
JF  - ACS Omega
VL  - 5
SP  - 11217
EP  - 11226
AB  - Since 2007, repeated outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) has affected millions of people worldwide and created global health concern with major complications like microcephaly and Guillain Barre’s syndrome. Generally, ZIKV transmits through mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) like other flaviviruses, but reports show blood transfusion and sexual mode of ZIKV transmission which further makes the situation alarming. Till date, there is not a single Zika specific licensed drug or vaccine present in the market. However, in recent months, several antiviral molecules have been screened against viral and host proteins. Among those, (−)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a green tea polyphenol has shown great virucidal potential against flaviviruses including ZIKV. However, the mechanistic understanding of EGCG targeting viral proteins is not yet entirely deciphered except little is known about its interaction with viral envelope protein and viral protease. Since literature has shown significant inhibitory interactions of EGCG against various kinases and bacterial DNA gyrases; we designed our study to find inhibitory actions of EGCG against ZIKV NS3 helicase. NS3 helicase is playing a significant role in viral replication by unwinding RNA after hydrolyzing NTP. We employed molecular docking and simulation approach and found significant interactions at ATPase site and also at RNA binding site. Further, the enzymatic assay has shown significant inhibition of NTPase activity with an IC50 value of 295.7 nM and Ki of 0.387 ± 0.034 µM. Our study suggests the possibility that EGCG could be considered as prime backbone molecule for further broad-spectrum and multitargeted inhibitor development against ZIKV and other flaviviruses.

TI  - Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Signaling Activation Antagonizes Autophagy To Facilitate Zika Virus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - The re-emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with neurological complications necessitates studies on the molecular mechanisms that regulate ZIKV pathogenesis. The mTOR signaling cascade is tightly regulated and central to normal neuronal development and survival. Disruption of mTOR signaling can result in neurological abnormalities. In the studies reported here, we demonstrate for the first time that ZIKV infection results in activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 to promote virus replication. Although autophagy is activated early in infection to counter virus replication, it is subsequently suppressed by mTOR. These results reveal critical roles of mTOR signaling and autophagy in ZIKV infection and point to a possible mechanism underlying ZIKV-induced pathogenesis. Elucidating the role of mTOR signaling in ZIKV infection will provide insights into the mechanisms of ZIKV-induced neurological complications and potential targets for therapeutic approaches. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus, is linked to microcephaly and other neurological defects in neonates and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. The molecular mechanisms regulating ZIKV infection and pathogenic outcomes are incompletely understood. Signaling by the mechanistic (mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is important for cell survival and proliferation, and viruses are known to hijack this pathway for their replication. Here, we show that in human neuronal precursors and glial cells in culture, ZIKV infection activates both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. Inhibition of mTOR kinase by Torin1 or rapamycin results in reduction in ZIKV protein expression and progeny production. Depletion of Raptor, the defining subunit of mTORC1, by small interfering RNA (siRNA) negatively affects ZIKV protein expression and viral replication. Although depletion of Rictor, the unique subunit of mTORC2, or the mTOR kinase itself also inhibits the viral processes, the extent of inhibition is less pronounced. Autophagy is transiently induced early by ZIKV infection, and impairment of autophagosome elongation by the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) enhances viral protein accumulation and progeny production. mTOR phosphorylates and inactivates ULK1 (S757) at later stages of ZIKV infection, suggesting a link between autophagy inhibition and mTOR activation by ZIKV. Accordingly, inhibition of ULK1 (by MRT68921) or autophagy (by 3-MA) reversed the effects of mTOR inhibition, leading to increased levels of ZIKV protein expression and progeny production. Our results demonstrate that ZIKV replication requires the activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, which negatively regulates autophagy to facilitate ZIKV replication. IMPORTANCE The re-emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with neurological complications necessitates studies on the molecular mechanisms that regulate ZIKV pathogenesis.

AB  - Brazil has experienced an increase in outbreaks caused by flaviviruses. The high incidence of dengue fever, the morbidity of Zika in children, and the high mortality of yellow fever have affected millions in recent years. Deciphering host-virus interactions is important for treating viral infections, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are an interesting target because of their role in flavivirus replication. In particular, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), which targets extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), is necessary for dengue and yellow fever infections. In this study, we evaluated the role of the MEK/ERK pathway and the effect of the MEK inhibitor trametinib on the Asian ZIKV strain PE243 and the prototype African ZIKV strain MR766, addressing genome replication, morphogenesis, and viral release. ZIKV infection stimulated ERK phosphorylation in Vero cells at 12 and 18 hours postinfection (hpi). Trametinib showed sustained antiviral activity, inhibiting both ZIKV strains for at least four days, and electron microscopy showed probable inhibition of ZIKV morphogenesis. ZIKV PE243 can complete one cycle in Vero cells in 14 hours; genome replication was detected around 8 hpi, intracellular viral particles at 12 hpi, and extracellular progeny at 14 hpi. Treatments at 6-hour intervals showed that trametinib inhibited late stages of viral replication, and the titration of intra- or extracellular virions showed that the treatment especially affected viral morphogenesis and release. Thus, ZIKV stimulated ERK phosphorylation during viral morphogenesis and release, which correlated with trametinib inhibiting both the signaling pathway and viral replication.

TI  - Methylene blue is a potent and broad-spectrum inhibitor against Zika virus in vitro and in vivo
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 9
SP  - 2404
EP  - 2416
AB  - ABSTRACT Many flaviviruses including the Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus, Yellow Fever virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus are significant human pathogens, unfortunately without any specific therapy. Here, we demonstrate that methylene blue, an FDA-approved drug, is a broad-spectrum and potent antiviral against Zika virus and Dengue virus both in vitro and in vivo. We found that methylene blue can considerably inhibit the interactions between viral protease NS3 and its NS2B co-factor, inhibit viral protease activity, inhibit viral growth, protect 3D mini-brain organoids from ZIKV infection, and reduce viremia in a mouse model. Mechanistic studies confirmed that methylene blue works in both entry and post entry steps, reduces virus production in replicon cells and inhibited production of processed NS3 protein. Overall, we have shown that methylene blue is a potent antiviral for management of flavivirus infections, particularly for Zika virus. As an FDA-approved drug, methylene blue is well-tolerated for human use. Therefore, methylene blue represents a promising and easily developed therapy for management of infections by ZIKV and other flaviviruses.

TI  - Microbes increase thermal sensitivity in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, with the potential to change disease distributions
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 15
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of many disease-causing viruses, including dengue (DENV), Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. As consequences of climate change, we expect an increase in both global mean temperatures and extreme climatic events. When temperatures fluctuate, mosquito vectors will be increasingly exposed to temperatures beyond their upper thermal limits. Here, we examine how DENV infection alters Ae. aegypti thermotolerance by using a high-throughput physiological ‘knockdown’ assay modeled on studies in Drosophila. Such laboratory measures of thermal tolerance have previously been shown to accurately predict an insect’s distribution in the field. We show that DENV infection increases thermal sensitivity, an effect that may ultimately limit the geographic range of the virus. We also show that the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis, which is currently being released globally as a biological control agent, has a similar impact on thermal sensitivity in Ae. aegypti. Surprisingly, in the coinfected state, Wolbachia did not provide protection against DENV-associated effects on thermal tolerance, nor were the effects of the two infections additive. The latter suggests that the microbes may act by similar means, potentially through activation of shared immune pathways or energetic tradeoffs. Models predicting future ranges of both virus transmission and Wolbachia’s efficacy following field release may wish to consider the effects these microbes have on host survival.

TI  - Microbiota activates IMD pathway and limits Sindbis infection in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 10
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main vector of important arboviruses such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya. During infections mosquitoes can activate the immune pathways Toll, IMD and JAK/STAT to limit pathogen replication. Here, we evaluate the immune response profile of Ae. aegypti against Sindbis virus (SINV). We analyzed gene expression of components of Toll, IMD and JAK/STAT pathways and showed that a blood meal and virus infection upregulated aaREL2 in a microbiota-dependent fashion, since this induction was prevented by antibiotic. The presence of the microbiota activates IMD and impaired the replication of SINV in the midgut. Constitutive activation of the IMD pathway, by Caspar depletion, leads to a decrease in microbiota levels and an increase in SINV loads. Together, these results suggest that a blood meal is able to activate innate immune pathways, through a nutrient induced growth of microbiota, leading to upregulation of aaREL2 and IMD activation. Microbiota levels seemed to have a reciprocal interaction, where the proliferation of the microbiota activates IMD pathway that in turn controls bacterial levels, allowing SINV replication in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. The activation of the IMD pathway seems to have an indirect effect in SINV levels that is induced by the microbiota.

TI  - Microcephaly protein ANKLE2 promotes Zika virus replication
JF  - mBio
VL  - 16
AB  - ABSTRACT Orthoflaviviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that hijack host proteins to promote their own replication. Zika virus (ZIKV) is infamous among orthoflaviviruses for its association with severe congenital birth defects, notably microcephaly. We previously mapped ZIKV-host protein interactions and identified the interaction between ZIKV non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) and host microcephaly protein ankyrin repeat and LEM domain-containing 2 (ANKLE2). Using a fruit fly model, we showed that NS4A induced microcephaly in an ANKLE2-dependent manner. Here, we explore the role of ANKLE2 in ZIKV replication to understand the biological significance of the interaction from a viral perspective. We observe that ANKLE2 localization is drastically shifted to sites of NS4A accumulation during infection and that knockout of ANKLE2 reduces ZIKV replication in multiple human cell lines. This decrease in virus replication is coupled with a moderate increase in innate immune activation. Using microscopy, we observe dysregulated formation of virus-induced endoplasmic reticulum rearrangements in ANKLE2 knockout cells. Knockdown of the ANKLE2 ortholog in Aedes aegypti cells also decreases virus replication, suggesting ANKLE2 is a beneficial replication factor across hosts. Finally, we show that NS4A from four other orthoflaviviruses physically interacts with ANKLE2 and is also beneficial to their replication. Thus, ANKLE2 likely promotes orthoflavivirus replication by regulating membrane rearrangements that serve to accelerate viral genome replication and protect viral dsRNA from immune detection. Taken together with our previous results, our findings indicate that ZIKV and other orthoflaviviruses hijack ANKLE2 for a conserved role in replication, and this drives unique pathogenesis for ZIKV since ANKLE2 has essential roles in developing tissues. IMPORTANCE ZIKV is a major concern due to its association with birth defects, including microcephaly. We previously identified a physical interaction between ZIKV NS4A and host microcephaly protein ANKLE2. Mutations in ANKLE2 cause congenital microcephaly, and NS4A induces microcephaly in an ANKLE2-dependent manner. Here, we establish the role of ANKLE2 in ZIKV replication. Depletion of ANKLE2 from cells significantly reduces ZIKV replication and disrupts virus-induced membrane rearrangements. ANKLE2’s ability to promote ZIKV replication is conserved in mosquito cells and for other related mosquito-borne orthoflaviviruses. Our data point to an overall model in which ANKLE2 regulates virus-induced membrane rearrangements to accelerate orthoflavivirus replication and avoid immune detection. However, ANKLE2’s unique role in ZIKV NS4A-induced microcephaly is a consequence of ZIKV infection of important developing tissues in which ANKLE2 has essential roles.

TI  - microRNAs Control Antiviral Immune Response, Cell Death and Chemotaxis Pathways in Human Neuronal Precursor Cells (NPCs) during Zika Virus Infection
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 23
AB  - Viral infections have always been a serious burden to public health, increasing morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted by the Aedes aegypti vector and the causative agent of severe fetal neuropathogenesis and microcephaly. The virus crosses the placenta and reaches the fetal brain, mainly causing the death of neuronal precursor cells (NPCs), glial inflammation, and subsequent tissue damage. Genetic differences, mainly related to the antiviral immune response and cell death pathways greatly influence the susceptibility to infection. These components are modulated by many factors, including microRNAs (miRNAs). MiRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptionally the overall gene expression, including genes for the neurodevelopment and the formation of neural circuits. In this context, we investigated the pathways and target genes of miRNAs modulated in NPCs infected with ZIKV. We observed downregulation of miR-302b, miR-302c and miR-194, whereas miR-30c was upregulated in ZIKV infected human NPCs in vitro. The analysis of a public dataset of ZIKV-infected human NPCs evidenced 262 upregulated and 3 downregulated genes, of which 142 were the target of the aforementioned miRNAs. Further, we confirmed a correlation between miRNA and target genes affecting pathways related to antiviral immune response, cell death and immune cells chemotaxis, all of which could contribute to the establishment of microcephaly and brain lesions. Here, we suggest that miRNAs target gene expression in infected NPCs, directly contributing to the pathogenesis of fetal microcephaly.

TI  - Microscopy analysis of Zika virus morphogenesis in mammalian cells
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 10
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus that recently emerged in the Americas as an important pathogen mainly because of its expanded pathogenesis, and elevated tropism for neuronal cells, transposition across the placental barrier, and replication in reproductive tract cells. Thus, transmission modes are eventually independent of an invertebrate vector, which is an atypical behavior for the flavivirus genus and indicates the need to study the replication of this virus in different cell types. Although ZIKV became a target for public health programs, the interaction of this flavivirus with the infected cell is still poorly understood. Herein, we analyzed the main stages of virus morphogenesis in mammalian cells, from establishment of the viroplasm-like zone to viral release from infected cells, using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. In addition, we compared this with other host cell types and other members of the Flaviviridae family that present a similar dynamic.

TI  - MiR-103a-3p Promotes Zika Virus Replication by Targeting OTU Deubiquitinase 4 to Activate p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling Pathway
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in regulating virus infection and replication. However, the mechanism by which miRNA regulates Zika virus (ZIKV) replication remains elusive. We aim to explore how the differentially expressed miR-103a-3p regulates ZIKV replication and to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism. Methods Small RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in A549 cells with or without ZIKV infection and some of the dysregulated miRNAs were validated by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). The effect of miR-103a-3p on ZIKV replication was examined by transfecting miR-103a-3p mimic or negative control (NC) into A549 cells with or without p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 and expression levels of ZIKV NS5 mRNA and NS1 protein were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. The potential target genes for miR-103a-3p were predicted by four algorithms and further validated by mutation analysis through luciferase reporter assay. The predicated target gene OTU deubiquitinase (DUB) 4 (OTUD4) was over-expressed by plasmid transfection or silenced by siRNA transfection into cells prior to ZIKV infection. Activation status of p38 MAPK signaling pathway was revealed by looking at the phosphorylation levels of p38 (p-p38) and HSP27 (p-HSP27) by Western blot. Results Thirty-five differentially expressed miRNAs in ZIKV-infected A549 cells were identified by RNA-Seq analysis. Five upregulated and five downregulated miRNAs were further validated by qRT-PCR. One of the validated upregulated miRNAs, miR-103a-3p significantly stimulated ZIKV replication both at mRNA (NS5) and protein (NS1) levels. We found p38 MAPK signaling was activated following ZIKV infection, as demonstrated by the increased expression of the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and HSP27. Blocking p38 MAPK signaling pathway using SB203580 inhibited ZIKV replication and attenuated the stimulating effect of miR-103a-3p on ZIKV replication. We further identified OTUD4 as a direct target gene of miR-103a-3p. MiR-103a-3p over-expression or OTUD4 silencing activated p38 MAPK signaling and enhanced ZIKV replication. In contrast, OTUD4 over-expression inhibited p38 MAPK activation and decreased ZIKV replication. In addition, OTUD4 over-expression attenuated the stimulating effect of miR-103a-3p on ZIKV replication and activation of p38 MAPK signaling. Conclusion Zika virus infection induced the expression of miR-103a-3p, which subsequently activated p38 MAPK signaling pathway by targeting OTUD4 to facilitate ZIKV replication.

TI  - miR-142 Targets TIM-1 in Human Endothelial Cells: Potential Implications for Stroke, COVID-19, Zika, Ebola, Dengue, and Other Viral Infections
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 23
AB  - T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) has been recently identified as one of the factors involved in the internalization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human cells, in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), neuropilin-1, and others. We hypothesized that specific microRNAs could target TIM-1, with potential implications for the management of patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). By combining bioinformatic analyses and functional assays, we identified miR-142 as a specific regulator of TIM-1 transcription. Since TIM-1 has been implicated in the regulation of endothelial function at the level of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its levels have been shown to be associated with stroke and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, we validated miR-142 as a functional modulator of TIM-1 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). Taken together, our results indicate that miR-142 targets TIM-1, representing a novel strategy against cerebrovascular disorders, as well as systemic complications of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.

TI  - miRNA-431-5p enriched in EVs derived from IFN-β stimulated MSCs potently inhibited ZIKV through CD95 downregulation
JF  - Stem Cell Research & Therapy
VL  - 15
AB  - Background Zika virus (ZIKV) primarily spreads through mosquito bites and can lead to microcephaly in infants and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. It is noteworthy that ZIKV can persist in the semen of infected males for extended periods and can be sexually transmitted. Infection with ZIKV has severe pathological manifestations on the testicular tissues of male mice, resulting in reduced sperm motility and fertility. However, there are no approved prophylactic vaccines or therapeutics available to treat Zika virus infection. Methods Using a male type I and II interferon receptor-deficient (ifnar1(-/-) ifngr1(-/-)) C57BL/6 (AG6) mouse model infected with ZIKV as a representative model, we evaluated the degree of testicular damage and viral replication in various organs in mice treated with EVs derived from MSC-stimulated with IFN-β (IFNβ-EVs) and treated with controls. We measured testicle size, detected viral load in various organs, and analyzed gene expression to assess treatment efficacy. Results Our findings demonstrated that intravenous administration of IFNβ-EVs effectively suppressed ZIKV replication in the testes. Investigation with in-depth RNA sequencing analysis found that IFN-β treatment changed the cargo miRNA of EVs. Notably, miR-431-5p was identified to be significantly enriched in IFNβ-EVs and exhibited potent antiviral activity in vitro. We showed that CD95 was a direct downstream target for miR-431-5p and played a role in facilitating ZIKV replication. miR-431-5p effectively downregulated the expression of CD95 protein, consequently promoted the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of NF-kB, which resulted in the activation of anti-viral status, leading to the suppression of viral replication. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that the EVs produced by IFNβ-treated MSCs could effectively convey antiviral activity.

TI  - Modeling Human Peripheral Myelin Fully from Pluripotent Stem Cells and Immune-mediated Neuropathy In Vitro using ZIKA Virus
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The generation of in vitro model of human peripheral myelin development and associated disease from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has been a challenge so far. In addition, the underlying mechanism for ZIKA virus (ZIKV) infection incurred Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) remains unexplored due to the lack of a suitable model. Here, we report the de novo generation of a human peripheral myelination model with competent Schwann cells (SCs). Those human SCs generated from hPSCs via compound screening were capable of forming compact myelin both in vitro and in vivo. We found ZIKV infection caused GBS-like events in vitro including myelin sheath degeneration, as well as dysregulated transcriptional profile including the activated cell death pathways and cytokine production. These effects could be partially reversed by several pharmacological inhibitors. Our model therefore provides a new and robust tool for studying the pathogenic mechanisms and developing of therapeutic strategies for related neuropathies.

AB  - Significance Wolbachia (wMel strain)-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are refractory to disseminated arboviral infections. Yet previous studies into the mechanism behind Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking have not considered the involvement of lipids, apart from cholesterol, during superinfection. We used liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to study the lipidome in mosquito cells infected with virus, wMel, or superinfected with both virus and wMel. Interestingly, a class of lipids, acyl-carnitines increased during virus infection but remained low with wMel. These findings uncover a previously unknown role for acyl-carnitines in the interaction among virus, wMel, and cells, suggesting a mechanism underlying Wolbachia-mediated pathogen blocking. Importantly, this study supports Wolbachia introgression into A. Aegypti populations as a biocontrol method to reduce arboviral (e.g., DENV) transmission. Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are refractory to flavivirus infections, but the role of lipids in Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking remains to be elucidated. Here, we use liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to provide a comprehensive picture of the lipidome of Aedes aegypti (Aag2) cells infected with Wolbachia only, either dengue or Zika virus only, and Wolbachia-infected Aag2 cells superinfected with either dengue or Zika virus. This approach identifies a class of lipids, acyl-carnitines, as being down-regulated during Wolbachia infection. Furthermore, treatment with an acyl-carnitine inhibitor assigns a crucial role for acyl-carnitines in the replication of dengue and Zika viruses. In contrast, depletion of acyl-carnitines increases Wolbachia density while addition of commercially available acyl-carnitines impairs Wolbachia production. Finally, we show an increase in flavivirus infection of Wolbachia-infected cells with the addition of acyl-carnitines. This study uncovers a previously unknown role for acyl-carnitines in this tripartite interaction that suggests an important and broad mechanism that underpins Wolbachia-mediated pathogen blocking.

TI  - Modulation of cellular machineries by Zika virus‐encoded proteins
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - The strain of Zika virus (ZIKV) that circulated during the 2015 epidemic in Brazil has been associated with more than 2000 cases of microcephaly from September 2015 through November 2016. The viral genome determines the biology and pathogenesis of a virus and the virus employs its own gene products to evade host immune surveillance, manipulate cellular machineries, and establish efficient replication. Therefore, understanding the functions of virus‐encoded protein not only aids the knowledge of ZIKV biology but also guides the development of anti‐ZIKV drugs. In this review, we focus on 10 proteins encoded by ZIKV and summarize their functions in ZIKV replication and pathogenesis according to studies published in the past 6 years.

JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology
VL  - 34
AB  - Arthropod‐borne viruses (arboviruses) pose significant threats to global public health by causing a spectrum of diseases ranging from mild febrile illnesses to severe neurological complications. Understanding the intricate interplay between arboviruses and the immune system within the central nervous system is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat these infections and mitigate their neurological sequelae. This review comprehensively explores the mechanisms by which arboviruses such as Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Dengue virus manipulate immune responses within the CNS, leading to diverse clinical manifestations.

TI  - Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms Underlying Neurologic Manifestations of Mosquito-Borne Flavivirus Infections
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Flaviviruses are a family of enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome, transmitted by arthropod vectors. These viruses are known for their broad cellular tropism leading to infection of multiple body systems, which can include the central nervous system. Neurologic effects of flavivirus infection can arise during both acute and post-acute infectious periods; however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying post-acute sequelae are not fully understood. Here, we review recent studies that have examined molecular and cellular mechanisms that may contribute to neurologic sequelae following infection with the West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Zika virus, dengue virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus. Neuronal death, either from direct infection or due to the resultant inflammatory response, is a common mechanism by which flavivirus infection can lead to neurologic impairment. Other types of cellular damage, such as oxidative stress and DNA damage, appear to be more specific to certain viruses. This article aims to highlight mechanisms of cellular damage that are common across several flavivirus members and mechanisms that are more unique to specific members. Our goal is to inspire further research to improve understanding of this area in the hope of identifying treatment options for flavivirus-associated neurologic changes.

TI  - Molecular Basis of Differential Stability and Temperature Sensitivity of ZIKA versus Dengue Virus Protein Shells
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 10
AB  - Rapid spread of ZIKA virus (ZIKV) and its association with severe birth defects have raised worldwide concern. Recent studies have shown that ZIKV retains its infectivity and remains structurally stable at temperatures up to 40 °C, unlike dengue and other flaviviruses. In spite of recent cryo-EM structures that showed similar architecture of ZIKA and dengue virus (DENV) E protein shells, little is known that makes ZIKV so temperature insensitive. Here, we attempt to unravel the molecular basis of greater thermal stability of ZIKV over DENV2 by executing atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the viral E protein shells at 37 °C. Our results suggest that ZIKA E protein shell retains its structural integrity through stronger inter-raft communications facilitated by a series of electrostatic and H-bonding interactions among multiple inter-raft residues. In comparison, the DENV2 E protein shell surface was loosly packed that exhibited holes at all 3-fold vertices, in close agreement with another EM structure solved at 37 °C. The residue-level information obtained from our study could pave way for designing small molecule inhibitors and specific antibodies to inhibit ZIKV E protein assembly and membrane fusion.

TI  - Molecular Insights into the Flavivirus Replication Complex
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Flaviviruses are vector-borne RNA viruses, many of which are clinically relevant human viral pathogens, such as dengue, Zika, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile and yellow fever viruses. Millions of people are infected with these viruses around the world each year. Vaccines are only available for some members of this large virus family, and there are no effective antiviral drugs to treat flavivirus infections. The unmet need for vaccines and therapies against these flaviviral infections drives research towards a better understanding of the epidemiology, biology and immunology of flaviviruses. In this review, we discuss the basic biology of the flavivirus replication process and focus on the molecular aspects of viral genome replication. Within the virus-induced intracellular membranous compartments, flaviviral RNA genome replication takes place, starting from viral poly protein expression and processing to the assembly of the virus RNA replication complex, followed by the delivery of the progeny viral RNA to the viral particle assembly sites. We attempt to update the latest understanding of the key molecular events during this process and highlight knowledge gaps for future studies.

TI  - Molecular mechanism of divalent-metal-induced activation of NS3 helicase and insights into Zika virus inhibitor design
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 44
SP  - 10505
EP  - 10514
AB  - Zika virus has attracted increasing attention because of its potential for causing human neural disorders, including microcephaly in infants and Guillain–Barré syndrome. Its NS3 helicase domain plays critical roles in NTP-dependent RNA unwinding and translocation during viral replication. Our structural analysis revealed a pre-activation state of NS3 helicase in complex with GTPγS, in which the triphosphate adopts a compact conformation in the absence of any divalent metal ions. In contrast, in the presence of a divalent cation, GTPγS adopts an extended conformation, and the Walker A motif undergoes substantial conformational changes. Both features contribute to more extensive interactions between the GTPγS and the enzyme. Thus, this study provides structural evidence on the allosteric modulation of MgNTP2− on the NS3 helicase activity. Furthermore, the compact conformation of inhibitory NTP identified in this study provides precise information for the rational drug design of small molecule inhibitors for the treatment of ZIKV infection.

TI  - Molecular mechanism of resveratrol inhibition of Zika virus NS3 helicase: behind the scenes
JF  - Future Virology
AB  - Aim: Zika virus (ZIKV) still poses a health risk to women and their babies without US FDA-approved vaccines or treatments. Experimentation has proved resveratrol inhibition of ZIKV NS3 helicase without specifying the molecular events during inhibition. Materials & methods: Herein, we leaped forward to study the molecular dynamics of the bound and unbound enzyme, identifying precise binding residues and interactions, and the enzyme's adaptation to support binding, since loop dynamics affect viral RNA replication. Results: Resveratrol stabilizes the P-loop and causes the RNA-binding loop to block the RNA-binding pocket for 200 ns, which is concurrent with experimental evidence that resveratrol binding significantly reduces ATP hydrolysis activity. Conclusion: This study illuminates the structural dynamics of ZIKV helicase and druglikeness of resveratrol, which will advance anti-ZIKV drug development.

JF  - The Indian Journal of Medical Research
VL  - 154

EP  - 445
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), member of the family Flaviviridae belonging to genus Flavivirus, is an arthropod-borne virus. The ZIKV is known to cause severe congenital birth defects in neonates. Due to a large number of worldwide outbreaks and associated neurological complications with ZIKV, a public health emergency was declared by the World Health Organization on February 1, 2016. The virus exhibits neurotropism and has a specific propensity towards neural precursor cells of the developing brain. In utero ZIKV infection causes massive cell death in the developing brain resulting in various motor and cognitive disabilities in newborns. The virus modulates cell machinery at several levels to replicate itself and inhibits toll like receptors-3 signalling, deregulates microRNA circuitry and induces a chronic inflammatory response in affected cells. Several significant advances have been made to understand the mechanisms of neuropathogenesis, its prevention and treatment. The current review provides an update on cellular and molecular mechanisms of ZIKV-induced alterations in the function of various brain cells.

JF  - Molecular Neurobiology
VL  - 60
SP  - 68
EP  - 83
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a teratogen that causes congenital anomalies, being linked to microcephaly in children exposed during pregnancy. Animal studies have been conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms related to ZIKV teratogenesis. Although animal models can mimic the effects of ZIKV in human embryo development, few in vivo studies have addressed molecular changes following ZIKV infection in embryos. Moreover, few literature reviews have been conducted with these studies. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of ZIKV teratogenesis determined from studies in animal models. PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus as well as grey literature were searched for studies that evaluated molecular alterations related to ZIKV teratogenesis which occurred during embryonic development. Nine studies were included: six with mice, one with mice and guinea pigs, one with pigs and one with chickens. In general, studies presented an unclear or high risk of bias for methodological criteria. Most of studies reported embryos exposed to ZIKV presenting microcephaly, reduced cortex thickness, and growth restriction. Different techniques were used to evaluated molecular changes in the animals following ZIKV infection: RNA sequencing, RT-qPCR, and in situ hybridization. It was found that common pathways are changed in most studies, being pathways related to immune response upregulated and those involved to neurodevelopment downregulated.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms underlying the extreme mechanical anisotropy of the flaviviral exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs)
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 11
AB  - Mechanical anisotropy is an essential property for many biomolecules to assume their structures, functions and applications, however, the mechanisms for their direction-dependent mechanical responses remain elusive. Herein, by using a single-molecule nanopore sensing technique, we explore the mechanisms of directional mechanical stability of the xrRNA1 RNA from ZIKA virus (ZIKV), which forms a complex ring-like architecture. We reveal extreme mechanical anisotropy in ZIKV xrRNA1 which highly depends on Mg2+ and the key tertiary interactions. The absence of Mg2+ and disruption of the key tertiary interactions strongly affect the structural integrity and attenuate mechanical anisotropy. The significance of ring structures in RNA mechanical anisotropy is further supported by steered molecular dynamics simulations in combination with force distribution analysis. We anticipate the ring structures can be used as key elements to build RNA-based nanostructures with controllable mechanical anisotropy for biomaterial and biomedical applications. The xrRNA1 RNA from ZIKA virus (ZIKV) forms a complex ring-like architecture and is known for its mechanical anisotropy, but the mechanism for its direction-dependent mechanical responses remain unclear. Here authors use a single-molecule nanopore sensing technique combined with molecular dynamics simulations and show that the anisotropy in ZIKV xrRNA1 depends on Mg2+ and the key tertiary interactions.

JF  - Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria
VL  - 81

AB  - Abstract Background  Evidence indicates a strong link between Zika virus (ZikV) and neurological complications. Acute myelitis, optic neuritis, polyneuropathy, and encephalomyelitis that mimic inflammatory idiopathic demyelination disorders (IIDD) after ZikV infection have been reported in Brazil. Objective  The present study aims to investigate the possible occurrence of molecular mimicry between ZikV antigens and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) autoantigens, the most frequent IIDD of the central nervous system (CNS). Methods  A retrospective cohort study with 305 patients admitted due to suspected arbovirus infection in Rio de Janeiro was performed, all subjects were submitted to neurological examination, and a biological sample was collected for serologic and molecular diagnostic. Bioinformatics tools were used to analyze the peptides shared between ZikV antigens and MS autoantigens. Results  Of 305 patients, twenty-six were positive for ZikV and 4 presented IDD patterns found in MS cases. Sequence homology comparisons by bioinformatics approach between NS5 ZikV and PLP MS protein revealed a homology of 5/6 consecutive amino acids (CSSVPV/CSAVPV) with 83% identity, deducing a molecular mimicry. Analysis of the 3D structures revealed a similar conformation with alpha helix presentation. Conclusions  Molecular mimicry between NS5 Zika virus antigen and PLP MS autoantigens emerge as a possible mechanism for IDD spectrum in genetically susceptible individuals.

VL  - 7
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV), originally discovered in 1947, did not become a major concern until the virus swept across the Pacific and into the Americas in the last decade, bringing with it news of neurological complications and birth defects in ZIKV affected areas. This prompted researchers to dissect the molecular interactions between ZIKV and the mosquito vector in an attempt to better understand not only the changes that occur upon infection, but to also identify molecules that may potentially enhance or suppress a mosquito’s ability to become infected and/or transmit the virus. Here, we review what is currently known regarding ZIKV-mosquito molecular interactions, focusing on ZIKV infection of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, the primary species implicated in transmitting ZIKV during the recent outbreaks.

TI  - Montelukast, an Anti-asthmatic Drug, Inhibits Zika Virus Infection by Disrupting Viral Integrity
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - The association of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and severe complications including neurological sequelae especially fetal microcephaly has aroused global attentions since its outbreak in 2015. Currently, there are no vaccines or therapeutic drugs clinically approved for treatments of ZIKV infection, however. And the drugs used for treating ZIKV in pregnant women require a higher safety profile. Here, we identified an anti-asthmatic drug, montelukast, which is of safety profile for pregnant women and exhibited antiviral efficacy against ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo. And we showed that montelukast could disrupt the integrity of the virions to release the viral genomic RNA, hence irreversibly inhibiting viral infectivity. In consideration of the neuro-protective activity that montelukast possessed, which was previously reported, it is promising that montelukast could be used for patients with ZIKV infection, particularly for pregnant women.

TI  - Mosquito antiviral defense mechanisms: a delicate balance between innate immunity and persistent viral infection
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 12
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases are associated with major global health burdens. Aedes spp. and Culex spp. are primarily responsible for the transmission of the most medically important mosquito-borne viruses, including dengue virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus. Despite the burden of these pathogens on human populations, the interactions between viruses and their mosquito hosts remain enigmatic. Viruses enter the midgut of a mosquito following the mosquito’s ingestion of a viremic blood meal. During infection, virus recognition by the mosquito host triggers their antiviral defense mechanism. Of these host defenses, activation of the RNAi pathway is the main antiviral mechanism, leading to the degradation of viral RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication and promoting viral clearance. However, whilst antiviral host defense mechanisms limit viral replication, the mosquito immune system is unable to effectively clear the virus. As such, these viruses can establish persistent infection with little or no fitness cost to the mosquito vector, ensuring life-long transmission to humans. Understanding of the mosquito innate immune response enables the discovery of novel antivectorial strategies to block human transmission. This review provides an updated and concise summary of recent studies on mosquito antiviral immune responses, which is a key determinant for successful virus transmission. In addition, we will also discuss the factors that may contribute to persistent infection in mosquito hosts. Finally, we will discuss current mosquito transmission-blocking strategies that utilize genetically modified mosquitoes and Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes for resistance to pathogens.

TI  - Mosquito co-infection with Zika and chikungunya virus allows simultaneous transmission without affecting vector competence of Aedes aegypti
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 11
AB  - Background Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that are currently a serious health burden in the Americas, and elsewhere in the world. ZIKV and CHIKV co-circulate in the same geographical regions and are mainly transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurs via single or multiple mosquito bites. Here we investigate the potential of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes to transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV in one bite, and we assess the consequences of co-infection on vector competence. Methodology/Principal findings First, growth curves indicated that co-infection with CHIKV negatively affects ZIKV production in mammalian, but not in mosquito cells. Next, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were infected with ZIKV, CHIKV, or co-infected via an infectious blood meal or intrathoracic injections. Infection and transmission rates, as well as viral titers of positive mosquitoes, were determined at 14 days after blood meal or 7 days after injection. Saliva and bodies of (co-)infected mosquitoes were scored concurrently for the presence of ZIKV and/or CHIKV using a dual-colour immunofluorescence assay. The results show that orally exposed Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are highly competent, with transmission rates of up to 73% for ZIKV, 21% for CHIKV, and 12% of mosquitoes transmitting both viruses in one bite. However, simultaneous oral exposure to both viruses did not change infection and transmission rates compared to exposure to a single virus. Intrathoracic injections indicate that the selected strain of Ae. aegypti has a strong salivary gland barrier for CHIKV, but a less profound barrier for ZIKV. Conclusions/Significance This study shows that Ae. aegypti can transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV via a single bite. Furthermore, co-infection of ZIKV and CHIKV does not influence the vector competence of Ae. aegypti.

TI  - Mosquito immune cells enhance dengue and Zika virus dissemination in Aedes aegypti
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Mosquito-borne viruses cause more than 400 million annual infections and place over half of the world’s population at risk. Despite this importance, the mechanisms by which arboviruses infect the mosquito host and disseminate to tissues required for transmission are not well understood. Here, we provide evidence that mosquito immune cells, known as hemocytes, play an integral role in the dissemination of dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. We establish that phagocytic hemocytes are a focal point for virus infection and demonstrate that these immune cell populations facilitate virus dissemination to the ovaries and salivary glands. Additional transfer experiments confirm that virus-infected hemocytes confer a virus infection to non-infected mosquitoes more efficiently than free virus in acellular hemolymph, revealing that hemocytes are an important tropism to enhance virus dissemination in the mosquito host. These data support a “trojan horse” model of virus dissemination where infected hemocytes transport virus through the hemolymph to deliver virus to mosquito tissues required for transmission and parallels vertebrate systems where immune cell populations promote virus dissemination to secondary sites of infection. In summary, this study significantly advances our understanding of virus infection dynamics in mosquitoes and highlights conserved roles of immune cells in virus dissemination across vertebrate and invertebrate systems.

TI  - Mosquito Oviposition Behavior and Vector Control
JF  - Insects
VL  - 7
AB  - The burden of gene transfer from one mosquito generation to the next falls on the female and her eggs. The selection of an oviposition site that guarantees egg and larval survival is a critical step in the reproductive process. The dangers associated with ephemeral aquatic habitats, lengthy droughts, freezing winters, and the absence of larval nutrition makes careful oviposition site selection by a female mosquito extremely important. Mosquito species exhibit a remarkable diversity of oviposition behaviors that ensure eggs are deposited into microenvironments conducive for successful larval development and the emergence of the next mosquito generation. An understanding of mosquito oviposition behavior is necessary for the development of surveillance and control opportunities directed against specific disease vectors. For example, Aedes aegypti Linnaeus is the vector of viruses causing important human diseases including yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The preference of this species to oviposit in natural and artificial containers has facilitated the development of Ae. aegypti-specific surveillance and toxic oviposition traps designed to detect and control this important vector species in and around disease foci. A better understanding of the wide diversity of mosquito oviposition behavior will allow the development of new and innovative surveillance and control devices directed against other important mosquito vectors of human and animal disease.

TI  - Mouse circulating extracellular vesicles contain virus‐derived siRNAs active in antiviral immunity
JF  - The EMBO Journal
VL  - 41
AB  - Induction and suppression of antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) has been observed in mammals during infection with at least seven distinct RNA viruses, including some that are pathogenic in humans. However, while the cell‐autonomous immune response mediated by antiviral RNAi is gradually being recognized, little is known about systemic antiviral RNAi in mammals. Furthermore, extracellular vesicles (EVs) also function in viral signal spreading and host immunity. Here, we show that upon antiviral RNAi activation, virus‐derived small‐interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) from Nodamura virus (NoV), Sindbis virus (SINV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) enter the murine bloodstream via EVs for systemic circulation. vsiRNAs in the EVs are biologically active, since they confer RNA–RNA homology‐dependent antiviral activity in both cultured cells and infant mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that vaccination with a live‐attenuated virus, rendered deficient in RNAi suppression, induces production of stably maintained vsiRNAs and confers protective immunity against virus infection in mice. This suggests that vaccination with live‐attenuated VSR (viral suppressor of RNAi)‐deficient mutant viruses could be a new strategy to induce immunity.

TI  - mRNA and miRNA profiling of Zika virus-infected human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells identifies miR-142-5p as an antiviral factor
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 9
SP  - 2061
EP  - 2075
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated with congenital brain abnormalities, a finding that highlights the urgent need to understand mother-to-fetus transmission mechanisms. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) are susceptible to ZIKV infection but the underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility remain largely unexplored. In this study, we have characterized and compared host mRNA and miRNA expression profiles in hUCMSCs after infection with two lineages of ZIKV, African (MR766) and Asian (PRVABC59). RNA sequencing analysis identified differentially expressed genes involved in anti-viral immunity and mitochondrial dynamics following ZIKV infection. In particular, ZIKV-infected hUCMSCs displayed mitochondrial elongation and the treatment of hUCMSCs with mitochondrial fission inhibitor led to a dose-dependent increase in ZIKV gene expression and decrease in anti-viral signalling pathways. Moreover, small RNA sequencing analysis identified several significantly up- or down-regulated microRNAs. Interestingly, miR-142-5p was significantly downregulated upon ZIKV infection, whereas cellular targets of miR-142-5p, IL6ST and ITGAV, were upregulated. Overexpression of miR-142-5p resulted in the suppression of ZIKV replication. Furthermore, blocking ITGAV expression resulted in a significant suppression of ZIKV binding to cells, suggesting a potential role of ITGAV in ZIKV entry. In conclusion, these results demonstrate both common and specific host responses to African and Asian ZIKV lineages and indicate miR-142-5p as a key regulator of ZIKV replication in the umbilical cords.

TI  - mTOR signaling regulates Zika virus replication bidirectionally through autophagy and protein translation
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) reemerged in 2016 and attracted much more attention worldwide. To date, the limited knowledge of ZIKV interactions with host cells in the early stages of infection impedes the prevention of viral epidemics and the treatment of ZIKV disease. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays an essential role in the regulation of autophagy and protein synthesis during multiple viral infections. This study aimed to investigate the functional role of mTOR signaling in ZIKV replication in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Immunoblotting demonstrated that ZIKV infection inhibited mTORC1 signaling, enhancing autophagy but obstructing protein translation. Drugs or siRNA for interfering with mTOR signaling molecules were utilized to demonstrate that AKT/TSC2/mTORC1 signaling was involved in ZIKV infection and that autophagy promoted ZIKV production, but viral protein expression was regulated by mTORC1 signaling. Moreover, confocal microscopy indicated a robust correlation between autophagy and viral RNA transcription. This study clarifies the dual functions of mTOR signaling during ZIKV infection and provides theoretical support for developing potential anti‐ZIKV drugs based on mTOR signaling molecules and deeper insights to better understand the mechanism between ZIKV and host cells.

TI  - mTOR Signalling in Arbovirus Infections: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Opportunities
JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology
VL  - 35
AB  - Arboviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and West Nile virus (WNV), are vector‐borne pathogens that exploit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway to optimise host cellular environments for replication, immune evasion, and pathogenesis. These viruses manipulate mTOR complexes through specific viral proteins, such as DENV NS5 activating mTORC2 to suppress apoptosis and ZIKV NS4A/NS4B inhibiting Akt‐mTORC1 signalling to impair neurogenesis while promoting autophagy. JEV NS1/NS1′ disrupts the blood‐brain barrier by inducing autophagy‐mediated degradation of tight junction proteins via mTOR suppression, contributing to encephalitis. These interactions result in severe pathological outcomes, including immune evasion, metabolic reprogramming, apoptosis suppression, and neurological disorders like microcephaly. Targeting mTOR has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for arbovirus infections. Rapamycin and its derivatives reduce viral replication and improve survival in preclinical models, while repurposed drugs like niclosamide and chloroquine exhibit antiviral effects against ZIKV. ATP‐competitive inhibitors such as Torin‐1 and natural compounds like resveratrol expand the therapeutic landscape. Combination therapies pairing mTOR inhibitors with antivirals or immune modulators may provide synergistic benefits. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying arbovirus manipulation of mTOR signalling and emphasises the potential of tailored therapeutic interventions targeting these pathways to mitigate arbovirus‐associated diseases.

TI  - Mucolipin-2 Cation Channel Increases Trafficking Efficiency of Endocytosed Viruses
JF  - mBio
VL  - 9
AB  - ABSTRACT Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a cellular process commonly hijacked by viruses to enter cells. The stages of entry are well described for certain viruses, but the host factors that mediate each step are less well characterized. We previously identified endosomal cation channel mucolipin-2 (MCOLN2) as a host factor that promotes viral infection. Here, we assign a role for MCOLN2 in modulating viral entry. We show that MCOLN2 specifically promotes viral vesicular trafficking and subsequent escape from endosomal compartments. This mechanism requires channel activity, occurs independently of antiviral signaling, and broadly applies to enveloped RNA viruses that require transport to late endosomes for infection, including influenza A virus, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus. We further identify a rare allelic variant of human MCOLN2 that has a loss-of-function phenotype with respect to viral enhancement. These findings establish a mechanistic link between an endosomal cation channel and late stages of viral entry. IMPORTANCE Viruses must co-opt cellular processes to complete their life cycle. To enter cells, viruses frequently take advantage of cellular receptor-mediated endocytosis pathways. A growing number of host proteins are implicated in these viral uptake pathways. Here, we describe a new role for the gated cation channel MCOLN2 in viral entry. This endosomal protein modulates viral entry by enhancing the efficiency of viral trafficking through the endosomal system. Thus, MCOLN2-mediated enhancement of infection may represent a key vulnerability in the viral life cycle that could be targeted for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Multifaceted contributions of Dicer2 to arbovirus transmission by Aedes aegypti
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are an increasing threat to global health. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway is considered the main antiviral immune pathway of insects, and thus represents a potential key target in the development of novel transmission-blocking strategies against arboviruses. Although the antiviral function of the siRNA pathway in Ae. aegypti is well established, its effective impact on arbovirus transmission is surprisingly poorly understood. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to create a line of Ae. aegypti in which we mutated Dicer2, a gene encoding the RNA sensor and key component of the siRNA pathway. Our Dicer2 null mutant line is viable and fertile, and only displays minor fitness defects despite being unable to produce siRNAs. The loss of Dicer2 affects early viral replication and systemic viral dissemination of four medically significant arboviruses (chikungunya, Mayaro, dengue, and Zika viruses) representing two viral families. However, measures of virus transmission potential indicate that Dicer2 null mutants and wild-type mosquitoes display an overall similar level of vector competence. Additionally, Dicer2 null mutants undergo significant virus-induced mortality during infection with chikungunya virus, but not dengue virus. Together, our results define a multifaceted role for Dicer2 in the transmission of arboviruses by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and pave the way for further mechanistic investigations.

TI  - Multifaceted Functions of CH25H and 25HC to Modulate the Lipid Metabolism, Immune Responses, and Broadly Antiviral Activities
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - With the frequent outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases in recent years, an effective broad-spectrum antiviral drug is becoming an urgent need for global public health. Cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H) and its enzymatic products 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a well-known oxysterol that regulates lipid metabolism, have been reported to play multiple functions in modulating cholesterol homeostasis, inflammation, and immune responses. CH25H and 25HC were recently identified as exerting broadly antiviral activities, including upon a variety of highly pathogenic viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Nipah virus (NiV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). The underlying mechanisms for its antiviral activities are being extensively investigated but have not yet been fully clarified. In this study, we summarized the current findings on how CH25H and 25HC play multiple roles to modulate cholesterol metabolism, inflammation, immunity, and antiviral infections. Overall, 25HC should be further studied as a potential therapeutic agent to control emerging infectious diseases in the future.

TI  - Multiple Salivary Proteins from Aedes aegypti Mosquito Bind to the Zika Virus Envelope Protein
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are important vectors of several debilitating and deadly arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses, including Yellow Fever virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus (ZIKV). Arbovirus transmission occurs when an infected mosquito probes the host’s skin in search of a blood meal. Salivary proteins from mosquitoes help to acquire blood and have also been shown to enhance pathogen transmission in vivo and in vitro. Here, we evaluated the interaction of mosquito salivary proteins with ZIKV by surface plasmon resonance and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that three salivary proteins AAEL000793, AAEL007420, and AAEL006347 bind to the envelope protein of ZIKV with nanomolar affinities. Similar results were obtained using virus-like particles in binding assays. These interactions have no effect on viral replication in cultured endothelial cells and keratinocytes. Additionally, we found detectable antibody levels in ZIKV and DENV serum samples against the recombinant proteins that interact with ZIKV. These results highlight complex interactions between viruses, salivary proteins and antibodies that could be present during viral transmissions.

TI  - Murine Trophoblast Stem Cells and Their Differentiated Cells Attenuate Zika Virus In Vitro by Reducing Glycosylation of the Viral Envelope Protein
JF  - Cells
VL  - 10
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy can cause devastating fetal neuropathological abnormalities, including microcephaly. Most studies of ZIKV infection in pregnancy have focused on post-implantation stage embryos. Currently, we have limited knowledge about how a pre-implantation stage embryo deals with a viral infection. This study investigates ZIKV infection on mouse trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) and their in vitro differentiated TSCs (DTSCs), which resemble the cellular components of the trophectoderm layer of the blastocyst that later develops into the placenta. We demonstrate that TSCs and DTSCs are permissive to ZIKV infection; however, ZIKV propagated in TSCs and DTSCs exhibit substantially lower infectivity, as shown in vitro and in a mouse model compared to ZIKV that was generated in Vero cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We further show that the low infectivity of ZIKV propagated in TSCs and DTSCs is associated with a reduced level of glycosylation on the viral envelope (E) proteins, which are essential for ZIKV to establish initial attachment by binding to cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The decreased level of glycosylation on ZIKV E is, at least, partially due to the low-level expression of a glycosylation-related gene, Hexa, in TSCs and DTSCs. Furthermore, this finding is not limited to ZIKV since similar observations have been made as to the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and West Nile virus (WNV) propagated in TSCs and DTSCs. In conclusion, our results reveal a novel phenomenon suggesting that murine TSCs and their differentiated cells may have adapted a cellular glycosylation system that can limit viral infectivity by altering the glycosylation of viral envelope proteins, therefore serving as a unique, innate anti-viral mechanism in the pre-implantation stage embryo.

Using available complete sequences of ZIKV we estimated directions of mutational pressure along the length of consensus sequences of three lineages of the virus. Results showed that guanine usage is growing in ZIKV RNA plus strand due to adenine to guanine transitions, while adenine usage is growing due to cytosine to adenine transversions. Especially high levels of guanine have been found in two-fold degenerated sites of certain areas of RNA plus strand with high amount of secondary structure. The usage of cytosine in two-fold degenerated sites shows direct dependence on the amount of secondary structure in 52% (consensus sequence of East African ZIKV lineage)—32% (consensus sequence of epidemic strains) of the length of RNA minus strand. These facts are the evidences of ADAR-editing of both strands of ZIKV genome during pauses in replication. RNA plus strand can also be edited by ADAR during pauses in translation caused by the appearance of groups of rare codons. According to our results, RNA minus strand of epidemic ZIKV strain has lower number of points in which polymerase can be stalled (allowing ADAR-editing) compared to other strains. The data on preferable directions of mutational pressure in epidemic ZIKV strain is useful for future vaccine development and understanding the evolution of new strains.

TI  - N-glycosylation in the Pre-Membrane Protein Is Essential for the Zika Virus Life Cycle
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Asparagine (N)-linked protein glycosylation plays an important role in protein synthesis and modification. Two Zika virus (ZIKV) structural proteins, the pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) protein are N-glycosylated. The prM protein of all ZIKV strains contains a single N-linked glycosylation site, while not all strains contain an N-linked site in the E protein. Our aim was to examine the impact of prM and E N-linked glycosylation on ZIKV infectivity and cell trafficking. Using a ZIKV infectious clone, we found that when the N-glycan sites were removed, the prM- and the prM/E-double mutants did not produce an infectious virus in the supernatant. Further, by using ZIKV prME constructs, we found that N-glycosylation was necessary for effective secretion of ZIKV virions. The absence of the N-glycan on prM or E caused protein aggregation in the rough endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) compartment. The aggregation was more pronounced for the prM-mutation, and the mutant virus lost the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) localization. In addition, lack of the N-glycan on prM induced nuclear translocation of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), an ER stress marker. To conclude, we show that the prM N-glycan is essential for the ZIKV infectious cycle, and plays an important role in viral protein trafficking, protein folding, and virion assembly.

TI  - N-glycosylation of Viral E Protein Is the Determinant for Vector Midgut Invasion by Flaviviruses
JF  - mBio
VL  - 9
AB  - ABSTRACT Transmission of flaviviruses by hematophagous insects such as mosquitoes requires acquisition of the virus during blood feeding on the host, with midgut as the primary infection site. Here, we report that N-glycosylation of the E protein, which is conserved among most flaviviruses, is critical for the Zika virus (ZIKV) to invade the vector midgut by inhibiting the reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway of the mosquito immune system. Our data further show that removal of the ZIKV E glycosylation site prevents mosquito infection by flaviviruses via the oral route, whereas there is no effect on infection by intrathoracic microinjection, which bypasses the midgut. Interestingly, the defect in infection of the mosquito midgut by the mutant virus through blood feeding is rescued by reduction of the ROS level by application of vitamin C, a well-known antioxidant. Therefore, our data demonstrate that ZIKV utilizes the glycosylation on the envelope to antagonize the vector immune defense during infection. IMPORTANCE Most flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), are transmitted between hosts by arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes, which acquire the virus during a blood meal. Here, by mutagenesis, we found a major role of the N-glycosylation of flavivirus E protein in its transmission circle, facilitating its survival against the vector immune system during invasion of the mosquito midgut while blood feeding on the host. In spite of the extensive studies of the involvement of N-glycan modification of flavivirus E protein in virus-host interactions, we discovered its critical role in virus-vector interaction and the evolution of flavivirus. Given the deleterious effects of ZIKV on human health, this study might have a significant impact on development of novel transmission-blocking strategies.

TI  - Negevirus Piura Suppresses Zika Virus Replication in Mosquito Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - We investigated the interaction between the insect-specific virus, Piura virus (PIUV), and the arbovirus Zika virus (ZIKV) in Aedes albopictus cells. We performed coinfection experiments in C6/36 cells. Piura virus (Cor 33 strain, Colombia) and ZIKV (PRVABC58 strain, Puerto Rico) were co-inoculated into C6/36 cells using two multiplicity of infection (MOI) combinations: 0.1 for both viruses and 1.0 for ZIKV, 0.1 for PIUV. Wells were infected in triplicate with either PIUV and ZIKV coinfection, ZIKV-only, or PIUV-only. Mock infected cells served as control wells. The cell suspension was collected daily 7 days post-infection. Zika virus load was titrated by TCID50 on Vero 76 cells. The ZIKV-only infection and PIUV and ZIKV coinfection experiments were also quantified by RT-qPCR. We also investigated whether ZIKV interfered in the PIUV replication. PIUV suppressed the replication of ZIKV, resulting in a 10,000-fold reduction in ZIKV titers within 3 days post-infection. PIUV viral loads were not reduced in the presence of ZIKV. We conclude that, when concurrently infected, PIUV suppresses ZIKV in C6/36 cells while ZIKV does not interfere in PIUV replication.

TI  - Network of Interactions between ZIKA Virus Non-Structural Proteins and Human Host Proteins
JF  - Cells
VL  - 9
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus and can be transmitted through an infected mosquito bite or through human-to-human interaction by sexual activity, blood transfusion, breastfeeding, or perinatal exposure. After the 2015–2016 outbreak in Brazil, a strong link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly emerged. ZIKV specifically targets human neural progenitor cells, suggesting that proteins encoded by ZIKV bind and inactivate host cell proteins, leading to microcephaly. Here, we present a systematic annotation of interactions between human proteins and the seven non-structural ZIKV proteins corresponding to a Brazilian isolate. The interaction network was generated by combining tandem-affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry with yeast two-hybrid screens. We identified 150 human proteins, involved in distinct biological processes, as interactors to ZIKV non-structural proteins. Our interacting network is composed of proteins that have been previously associated with microcephaly in human genetic disorders and/or animal models. Further, we show that the protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1) interacts with NS5 and modulates its stability. This study builds on previously published interacting networks of ZIKV and genes related to autosomal recessive primary microcephaly to generate a catalog of human cellular targets of ZIKV proteins implicated in processes related to microcephaly in humans. Collectively, these data can be used as a resource for future characterization of ZIKV infection biology and help create a basis for the discovery of drugs that may disrupt the interaction and reduce the health damage to the fetus.

TI  - Neural progenitor cell pyroptosis contributes to Zika virus-induced brain atrophy and represents a therapeutic target
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 117
SP  - 23869
EP  - 23878
AB  - Significance Zika virus (ZIKV) has been identified as a cause of microcephaly. However, the mechanisms by which ZIKV disrupts neurogenesis and causes microcephaly remains poorly understood. Here, we first report that ZIKV exposure causes neural progenitor cell pyroptosis, mediated by activation of caspase-1 and gasdermin D in vivo as well as in vitro, which links ZIKV to the development and progression of microcephaly. Consistent with this notion, caspase-1 deletion or treatment with caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 reduced ZIKV-induced inflammatory responses and pyroptosis, and robustly attenuated neuropathy and brain atrophy. Taken together, our findings provide unique perspectives on ZIKV-associated neuropathogenesis and potentially clinically applicable options for its treatment. Mounting evidence has associated Zika virus (ZIKV) infection with congenital malformations, including microcephaly, which raises global alarm. Nonetheless, mechanisms by which ZIKV disrupts neurogenesis and causes microcephaly are far from being understood. In this study, we discovered direct effects of ZIKV on neural progenitor cell development by inducing caspase-1– and gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptotic cell death, linking ZIKV infection with the development of microcephaly. Importantly, caspase-1 depletion or its inhibitor VX-765 treatment reduced ZIKV-induced inflammatory responses and pyroptosis, and substantially attenuated neuropathology and brain atrophy in vivo. Collectively, our data identify caspase-1– and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in neural progenitor cells as a previously unrecognized mechanism for ZIKV-related pathological effects during neural development, and also provide treatment options for ZIKV-associated diseases.

TI  - Neuroimmune Evasion of Zika Virus to Facilitate Viral Pathogenesis
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), which preferentially targets neural stem and progenitor cells (NSCs) especially in developing brain, is causally associated with fetal microcephaly, intrauterine retardation, and other congenital malformations in humans. However, there are, so far, no effective drugs and vaccines against ZIKV epidemics, warranting an enhanced understanding of ZIKV biology. Immune response is essential for neuronal cells to combat viral invasion. In turn, neurotropic ZIKV has developed a complex strategy of neuroimmune evasion to facilitate viral pathogenesis, especially developmental impairment in embryonic brain. Here, we review not only overall knowledge of ZIKV-related immune responses, but also current advances in our understanding of immune evasion in ZIKV infection. We also review several specific mechanisms underlying ZIKV protein-mediated immune evasion for viral pathogenesis.

TI  - Neuroinvasiveness of the MR766 strain of Zika virus in IFNAR-/- mice maps to prM residues conserved amongst African genotype viruses
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 17
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) strains are classified into the African and Asian genotypes. The higher virulence of the African MR766 strain, which has been used extensively in ZIKV research, in adult IFNα/β receptor knockout (IFNAR-/-) mice is widely viewed as an artifact associated with mouse adaptation due to at least 146 passages in wild-type suckling mouse brains. To gain insights into the molecular determinants of MR766’s virulence, a series of genes from MR766 were swapped with those from the Asian genotype PRVABC59 isolate, which is less virulent in IFNAR-/- mice. MR766 causes 100% lethal infection in IFNAR-/- mice, but when the prM gene of MR766 was replaced with that of PRVABC59, the chimera MR/PR(prM) showed 0% lethal infection. The reduced virulence was associated with reduced neuroinvasiveness, with MR766 brain titers ≈3 logs higher than those of MR/PR(prM) after subcutaneous infection, but was not significantly different in brain titers of MR766 and MR/PR(prM) after intracranial inoculation. MR/PR(prM) also showed reduced transcytosis when compared with MR766 in vitro. The high neuroinvasiveness of MR766 in IFNAR-/- mice could be linked to the 10 amino acids that differ between the prM proteins of MR766 and PRVABC59, with 5 of these changes affecting positive charge and hydrophobicity on the exposed surface of the prM protein. These 10 amino acids are highly conserved amongst African ZIKV isolates, irrespective of suckling mouse passage, arguing that the high virulence of MR766 in adult IFNAR-/- mice is not the result of mouse adaptation.

TI  - Neurotropism and behavioral changes associated with Zika infection in the vector Aedes aegypti
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 7
AB  - Abstract Understanding Zika virus infection dynamics is essential, as its recent emergence revealed possible devastating neuropathologies in humans, thus causing a major threat to public health worldwide. Recent research allowed breakthrough in our understanding of the virus and host pathogenesis; however, little is known on its impact on its main vector, Aedes aegypti. Here we show how Zika virus targets Aedes aegypti’s neurons and induces changes in its behavior. Results are compared to dengue virus, another flavivirus, which triggers a different pattern of behavioral changes. We used microelectrode array technology to record electrical spiking activity of mosquito primary neurons post infections and discovered that only Zika virus causes an increase in spiking activity of the neuronal network. Confocal microscopy also revealed an increase in synapse connections for Zika virus-infected neuronal networks. Interestingly, the results also showed that mosquito responds to infection by overexpressing glutamate regulatory genes while maintaining virus levels. This neuro-excitation, possibly via glutamate, could contribute to the observed behavioral changes in Zika virus-infected Aedes aegypti females. This study reveals the importance of virus-vector interaction in arbovirus neurotropism, in humans and vector. However, it appears that the consequences differ in the two hosts, with neuropathology in human host, while behavioral changes in the mosquito vector that may be advantageous to the virus.

TI  - Non-nucleoside Inhibitors of Zika Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - Zika virus belongs to the Flavivirus genus, which comprises several important human pathogens. There is currently neither an approved vaccine nor antiviral drugs available to prevent infection by ZIKV. The nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) polymerase, which is responsible for replicating the viral RNA genome, represents one of the most promising targets for antiviral drug development. Starting from compounds recently developed against dengue virus NS5, we designed and synthesized inhibitors targeting Zika virus NS5. We show that these novel compounds inhibit viral replication by targeting the polymerase activity. High-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of protein-inhibitor complexes demonstrated specific binding to an allosteric site within the polymerase, called the N pocket. This work paves the way for the future structure-based design of potent compounds specifically targeting ZIKV RNA polymerase activity. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) remains a potentially significant public health concern because it can cause teratogenic effects, such as microcephaly in newborns and neurological disease, like Guillain-Barré syndrome. Together with efforts to develop a vaccine, the discovery of antiviral molecules is important to control ZIKV infections and to prevent its most severe symptoms. Here, we report the development of small nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) of ZIKV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity. These NNIs target an allosteric pocket (N pocket) located next to a putative hinge region between the thumb and the palm subdomains that was originally described for dengue virus (DENV) RdRp. We first tested the activity of DENV RdRp N-pocket inhibitors against ZIKV RdRp, introduced chemical modifications into these molecules, and assessed their potency using both enzymatic and cell-based assays. The most potent compound had a 50% inhibitory concentration value of 7.3 μM and inhibited ZIKV replication in a cell-based assay with a 50% effective concentration value of 24.3 μM. Importantly, we report four high-resolution crystal structures detailing how these NNIs insert into the N pocket of ZIKV RdRp. Our observations point to subtle differences in the size, shape, chemical environment, and hydration of the N pocket from ZIKV RdRp from those of the N pocket from DENV RdRp that are crucial for the design of improved antiviral inhibitors with activity against ZIKV.

TI  - Noncoding RNA of Zika Virus Affects Interplay between Wnt-Signaling and Pro-Apoptotic Pathways in the Developing Brain Tissue
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has a unique ability among flaviviruses to cross the placental barrier and infect the fetal brain causing severe abnormalities of neurodevelopment known collectively as congenital Zika syndrome. In our recent study, we demonstrated that the viral noncoding RNA (subgenomic flaviviral RNA, sfRNA) of the Zika virus induces apoptosis of neural progenitors and is required for ZIKV pathogenesis in the developing brain. Herein, we expanded on our initial findings and identified biological processes and signaling pathways affected by the production of ZIKV sfRNA in the developing brain tissue. We employed 3D brain organoids generated from induced human pluripotent stem cells (ihPSC) as an ex vivo model of viral infection in the developing brain and utilized wild type (WT) ZIKV (producing sfRNA) and mutant ZIKV (deficient in the production of sfRNA). Global transcriptome profiling by RNA-Seq revealed that the production of sfRNA affects the expression of >1000 genes. We uncovered that in addition to the activation of pro-apoptotic pathways, organoids infected with sfRNA-producing WT, but not sfRNA-deficient mutant ZIKV, which exhibited a strong down-regulation of genes involved in signaling pathways that control neuron differentiation and brain development, indicating the requirement of sfRNA for the suppression of neurodevelopment associated with the ZIKV infection. Using gene set enrichment analysis and gene network reconstruction, we demonstrated that the effect of sfRNA on pathways that control brain development occurs via crosstalk between Wnt-signaling and proapoptotic pathways.

TI  - Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs Potently Inhibit the Replication of Zika Viruses by Inducing the Degradation of AXL
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 92
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, which causes congenital malformations, including microcephaly and other neurological disorders, has attracted global attention. We observed that several NSAIDs significantly inhibited ZIKV infection. Based on our observations, we propose a novel mechanism of action of antiviral compounds which involves the blockade of virus entry via degradation of the entry cofactor. Furthermore, NSAIDs can be practically used for preventing ZIKV infection in pregnant women, as certain NSAIDs, including ibuprofen and acetaminophen, are considered clinically safe. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is genetically and biologically related to other Flaviviridae family members and has disseminated to many countries. It is associated with severe consequences, including the abnormal development of the neural system in fetuses and neurological diseases in adults. Therefore, the development of anti-ZIKV drugs is of paramount importance. Screening of generic drugs revealed that several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, and lornoxicam, potently inhibited the entry of Zika virus Env/HIV-1-pseudotyped viruses. They also significantly inhibited the replication of wild-type ZIKV both in cell lines and in primary human fetal endothelial cells. Interestingly, the NSAIDs exerted this inhibitory effect by potently reducing the expression of AXL, the entry cofactor of ZIKV. Further studies showed that the NSAIDs downregulated the prostaglandin E2/prostaglandin E receptor 2 (EP2)/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway and reduced PKA-dependent CDC37 phosphorylation and the interaction between CDC37 and HSP90, which subsequently facilitated CHIP/ubiquitination/proteasome-mediated AXL degradation. Taken together, our results highlight a new mechanism of action of antiviral agents which may assist in designing a convenient strategy for treating ZIKV-infected patients. IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, which causes congenital malformations, including microcephaly and other neurological disorders, has attracted global attention.

TI  - Novel and potent inhibitors targeting DHODH are broad-spectrum antivirals against RNA viruses including newly-emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2
JF  - Protein & Cell
VL  - 11
SP  - 723
EP  - 739
AB  - Emerging and re-emerging RNA viruses occasionally cause epidemics and pandemics worldwide, such as the on-going outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of human DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus, Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against SARS-CoV-2. Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor so far with an EC50 of 17 nmol/L and an SI value of 10,505.88 in infected cells. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knock-out cells. This work demonstrates that both S312/S416 and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-regulation may have clinical potentials to cure SARS-CoV-2 or other RNA viruses circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses are mutated or not.

TI  - NS1 from Two Zika Virus Strains Differently Interact with a Membrane: Insights to Understand Their Differential Virulence
JF  - Journal of chemical information and modeling
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) from Uganda (UG) expresses a phenotype related to fetal loss, whereas the variant from Brazil (BR) induces microcephaly in neonates. The differential virulence has a direct relation to biomolecular mechanisms that make one strain more aggressive than the other. The nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a key viral toxin to comprehend these viral discrepancies because of its versatility in many processes of the virus life cycle. Here, we aim to examine through coarse-grained models and molecular dynamics simulations the protein-membrane interactions for both NS1ZIKV-UG and NS1ZIKV-BR dimers. A first evaluation allowed us to establish that the NS1 proteins, in the membrane presence, explore new conformational spaces when compared to systems simulated without a lipid bilayer. These events derive from both differential coupling patterns and discrepant binding affinities to the membrane. The N-terminal domain, intertwined loop, and greasy finger proposed previously as binding membrane regions were also computationally confirmed by us. The anchoring sites have aromatic and ionizable residues that manage the assembly of NS1 toward the membrane, especially for the Ugandan variant. Furthermore, in the presence of the membrane, the difference in the dynamic cross-correlation of residues between the two strains is particularly pronounced in the putative epitope regions. This suggests that the protein-membrane interaction induces changes in the distal part related to putative epitopes. Taken together, these results open up new strategies for the treatment of flaviviruses that would specifically target these dynamic differences.

TI  - NS5 Conservative Site Is Required for Zika Virus to Restrict the RIG-I Signaling
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 11
AB  - During host–virus co-evolution, cells develop innate immune systems to inhibit virus invasion, while viruses employ strategies to suppress immune responses and maintain infection. Here, we reveal that Zika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging arbovirus causing public concerns and devastating complications, restricts host immune responses through a distinct mechanism. ZIKV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) interacts with the host retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), an essential signaling molecule for defending pathogen infections. NS5 subsequently represses K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I, attenuates the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and inhibits the expression and production of interferon-β (IFN-β), thereby restricting the RIG-I signaling pathway. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the methyltransferase (MTase) domain of NS5 is required for the repression of RIG-I ubiquitination, IRF3 activation, and IFN-β production. Detailed studies further reveal that the conservative active site D146 of NS5 is critical for the suppression of the RIG-I signaling. Therefore, we uncover an essential role of NS5 conservative site D146 in ZIKV-mediated repression of innate immune system, illustrate a distinct mechanism by which ZIKV evades host immune responses, and discover a potential target for anti-viral infection.

TI  - NS5 from Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Can Adopt a Conformation Analogous to That of Its Zika Virus and Japanese Encephalitis Virus Homologues
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - Flaviviruses include important human pathogens, such as dengue virus and Zika virus. NS5 is a nonstructural protein essential for flavivirus RNA replication with dual MTase and RdRp enzyme activities and thus constitutes a major drug target. Insights into NS5 structure, dynamics, and evolution should inform the development of antiviral inhibitors and vaccine design. We found that NS5 from DENV2 can adopt a conformation resembling that of NS5 from JEV and ZIKV. Replacement of the DENV2 NS5 linker with the JEV and ZIKV NS5 linkers abolished DENV2 replication in cells, without significantly impacting in vitro DENV2 NS5 enzymatic activities. We propose that heterotypic flavivirus NS5 linkers impede DENV2 NS5 protein-protein interactions that are essential for virus replication. ABSTRACT Flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) contains an N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) domain and a C-terminal polymerase (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp]) domain fused through a 9-amino-acid linker. While the individual NS5 domains are structurally conserved, in the full-length protein, their relative orientations fall into two classes: the NS5 proteins from Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) adopt one conformation, while the NS5 protein from dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3) adopts another. Here, we report a crystallographic structure of NS5 from DENV2 in a conformation similar to the extended one seen in JEV and ZIKV NS5 crystal structures. Replacement of the DENV2 NS5 linker with DENV1, DENV3, DENV4, JEV, and ZIKV NS5 linkers had modest or minimal effects on in vitro DENV2 MTase and RdRp activities. Heterotypic DENV NS5 linkers attenuated DENV2 replicon growth in cells, while the JEV and ZIKV NS5 linkers abolished replication. Thus, the JEV and ZIKV linkers likely hindered essential DENV2 NS5 interactions with other viral or host proteins within the virus replicative complex. Overall, this work sheds light on the dynamics of the multifunctional flavivirus NS5 protein and its interdomain linker. Targeting the NS5 linker is a possible strategy for producing attenuated flavivirus strains for vaccine design.

TI  - NS5 Sumoylation Directs Nuclear Responses That Permit Zika Virus To Persistently Infect Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - ZIKV is a unique neurovirulent flavivirus that persistently infects human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs), the primary barrier that restricts viral access to neuronal compartments. Here, we demonstrate that flavivirus-specific SIM and SUMO sites determine the assembly of NS5 proteins into discrete nuclear bodies (NBs). We found that NS5 SIM sites are required for NS5 nuclear localization and that SUMO sites regulate NS5 NB complex constituents, assembly, and function. We reveal that ZIKV NS5 SUMO sites direct NS5 binding to STAT2, disrupt the formation of antiviral PML-STAT2 NBs, and direct PML degradation. ZIKV NS5 SUMO sites also transcriptionally regulate cell cycle and ISG responses that permit ZIKV to persistently infect hBMECs. Our findings demonstrate the function of SUMO sites in ZIKV NS5 NB formation and their importance in regulating nuclear responses that permit ZIKV to persistently infect hBMECs and thereby gain access to neurons. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is cytopathic to neurons and persistently infects brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs), which normally restrict viral access to neurons. Despite replicating in the cytoplasm, ZIKV and Dengue virus (DENV) polymerases, NS5 proteins, are predominantly trafficked to the nucleus. We found that a SUMO interaction motif in ZIKV and DENV NS5 proteins directs nuclear localization. However, ZIKV NS5 formed discrete punctate nuclear bodies (NBs), while DENV NS5 was uniformly dispersed in the nucleoplasm. Yet, mutating one DENV NS5 SUMO site (K546R) localized the NS5 mutant to discrete NBs, and NBs formed by the ZIKV NS5 SUMO mutant (K252R) were restructured into discrete protein complexes. In hBMECs, NBs formed by STAT2 and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein are present constitutively and enhance innate immunity. During ZIKV infection or NS5 expression, we found that ZIKV NS5 evicts PML from STAT2 NBs, forming NS5/STAT2 NBs that dramatically reduce PML expression in hBMECs and inhibit the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG). Expressing the ZIKV NS5 SUMO site mutant (K252R) resulted in NS5/STAT2/PML NBs that failed to degrade PML, reduce STAT2 expression, or inhibit ISG induction. Additionally, the K252 SUMOylation site and NS5 nuclear localization were required for ZIKV NS5 to regulate hBMEC cell cycle transcriptional responses. Our data reveal NS5 SUMO motifs as novel NB coordinating factors that distinguish flavivirus NS5 proteins. These findings establish SUMOylation of ZIKV NS5 as critical in the regulation of antiviral ISG and cell cycle responses that permit ZIKV to persistently infect hBMECs. IMPORTANCE ZIKV is a unique neurovirulent flavivirus that persistently infects human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs), the primary barrier that restricts viral access to neuronal compartments.

TI  - NS5-independent Ablation of STAT2 by Zika virus to antagonize interferon signalling
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 10
SP  - 1609
EP  - 1625
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus genus includes numerous arthropod-borne human pathogens that are clinically important. Flaviviruses are notorious for their ability to antagonize host interferon (IFN) induced anti-viral signalling. It has been documented that NS5s of flaviviruses mediate proteasome degradation of STAT2 to evade IFN signalling. Deciphering the molecular mechanism of the IFN antagonism by the viruses and reversing this antagonism may dictate anti-viral responses and provide novel antiviral approaches. In this report, by using Zika virus (ZIKV) as a model, we first demonstrated that ZIKV antagonized interferon signalling in an infectious dose-dependent manner; in other words, the virus antagonized interferon signalling at a high multiple of infection (MOI) and was sensitive to interferon signalling at a low MOI. Mechanistically, we found that ZIKV infection triggered degradation of ubiquitinated STAT2 and host short-lived proteins while didn't affect the proteasome activity per se. ZIKV infection resulted in suppression of host de novo protein synthesis. Overexpression of NS5 alone only marginally reduced STAT2 and had no effect on the host de novo protein synthesis. Ectopically expressed murine STAT2 that was resistant to NS5- and ZIKV-induced ablation exaggerated the IFN-induced anti-viral signalling. These data favour a new model of the innate immune evasion of ZIKV in which the viral infection triggers suppression of host de novo protein synthesis to accelerate the degradation of short-lived, ubiquitinated STAT2. As flaviviruses share a very conserved replication strategy, the mechanisms of IFN antagonism elucidated here might also be employed by other flaviviruses.

TI  - Nuclear accumulation of host transcripts during Zika Virus Infection
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 19
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infects fetal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) causing severe neurodevelopmental disorders in utero. Multiple pathways involved in normal brain development are dysfunctional in infected NPCs but how ZIKV centrally reprograms these pathways remains unknown. Here we show that ZIKV infection disrupts subcellular partitioning of host transcripts critical for neurodevelopment in NPCs and functionally link this process to the up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1). UPF1 is an RNA-binding protein known to regulate decay of cellular and viral RNAs and is less expressed in ZIKV-infected cells. Using infrared crosslinking immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing (irCLIP-Seq), we show that a subset of mRNAs loses UPF1 binding in ZIKV-infected NPCs, consistent with UPF1’s diminished expression. UPF1 target transcripts, however, are not altered in abundance but in subcellular localization, with mRNAs accumulating in the nucleus of infected or UPF1 knockdown cells. This leads to diminished protein expression of FREM2, a protein required for maintenance of NPC identity. Our results newly link UPF1 to the regulation of mRNA transport in NPCs, a process perturbed during ZIKV infection.

TI  - Nuclear localization of Zika virus NS5 contributes to suppression of type I interferon production and response
JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 102
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, which caused an unprecedented epidemic in Latin America. Among all viral non-structural proteins in flavivirus, NS5 is the most highly conserved and has multiple crucial functions, including participating in viral RNA replication and suppressing host innate immunity. Although ZIKV NS5 prominently localizes in the nucleus during infection, its specific nuclear localization signal (NLS), and its role in viral replication and pathogenesis remain controversial. Here, we identified aa 11–90 and aa 370–406 regions that contain NLSs, which are critical for nuclear localization of ZIKV NS5. Further experiments demonstrated that nuclear localization of ZIKV NS5 predominantly participates in suppression of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-mediated activation of type I IFN (IFN-I) transcription and inhibition of IFN-I downstream response independent of its effect on signal transducers and activators of transcription 2 (STAT2) degradation. These results suggest that subcellular localization of NS5 is important for its function on innate immune suppression, which provides new insight into ZIKV pathogenesis.

TI  - Nuclear membrane protein SUN2 promotes replication of flaviviruses through modulating cytoskeleton reorganization mediated by NS1
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 15
AB  - Cytoskeleton is extensively recruited by flaviviruses for their infection. In this study, we uncovered an essential role of a nuclear membrane protein, SAD1/UNC84 domain protein 2 (SUN2) linking cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton in the flavivirus replication. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of SUN2, but not SUN1, significantly reduces the replication of Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). In contrast, SUN2 does not affect the infection of non-flaviviridae RNA viruses. All three regions of SUN2 are required for its proviral effect. Mechanistically, SUN2 facilitates rearrangement of cytoskeleton and formation of replication organelles induced by viral infection, and hence promotes viral RNA synthesis. SUN2 is required for the interaction between cytoskeleton actin and ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). Expression of dominant negative Nesprin-1 and Nesprin-2, which connect SUN2 to cytoskeleton proteins, alleviates the interaction between actin and NS1 and reduces viral replication levels. In a neonatal mouse infection model, SUN2 knockout dramatically alleviates the in vivo ZIKV replication and development of neuropathology. This work elucidates that recruitment of cytoskeleton proteins by flavivirus is coordinated by nuclear membrane proteins SUN2 and Nesprins, providing evidence for a link between nuclear membrane proteins and flavivirus infection. Here, Huang et al. show that nuclear membrane proteins SUN2 and Nesprins are required for the in vitro and in vivo replication of Zika virus, through directing the cytoskeleton remodeling and formation of replication organelles mediated by viral NS1.

TI  - Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Transport of ZIKV Non-Structural 3 Protein Is Mediated by Importin-α/β and Exportin CRM-1
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 97
AB  - Flaviviruses have a cytoplasmic replication cycle, but recent evidence indicates that nuclear elements play a role in their viral replication. Viral proteins, such as NS5 and C, are imported into the nucleus, and blocking their import prevents replication. ABSTRACT Flaviviruses have a cytoplasmic replicative cycle, and crucial events, such as genome translation and replication, occur in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, some viral proteins, such as C, NS1, and NS5 from Zika virus (ZIKV) containing nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and nuclear export signals (NESs), are also located in the nucleus of Vero cells. The NS2A, NS3, and NS4A proteins from dengue virus (DENV) have also been reported to be in the nucleus of A549 cells, and our group recently reported that the NS3 protein is also located in the nucleus of Huh7 and C636 cells during DENV infection. However, the NS3 protease-helicase from ZIKV locates in the perinuclear region of infected cells and alters the morphology of the nuclear lamina, a component of the nuclear envelope. Furthermore, ZIKV NS3 has been reported to accumulate on the concave face of altered kidney-shaped nuclei and may be responsible for modifying other elements of the nuclear envelope. However, nuclear localization of NS3 from ZIKV has not been substantially investigated in human host cells. Our group has recently reported that DENV and ZIKV NS3 alter the nuclear pore complex (NPC) by cleaving some nucleoporins. Here, we demonstrate the presence of ZIKV NS3 in the nucleus of Huh7 cells early in infection and in the cytoplasm at later times postinfection. In addition, we found that ZIKV NS3 contains an NLS and a putative NES and uses the classic import (importin-α/β) and export pathway via CRM-1 to be transported between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses have a cytoplasmic replication cycle, but recent evidence indicates that nuclear elements play a role in their viral replication. Viral proteins, such as NS5 and C, are imported into the nucleus, and blocking their import prevents replication. Because of the importance of the nucleus in viral replication and the role of NS3 in the modification of nuclear components, we investigated whether NS3 can be localized in the nucleus during ZIKV infection. We found that NS3 is imported into the nucleus via the importin pathway and exported to the cytoplasm via CRM-1. The significance of viral protein nuclear import and export and its relationship with infection establishment is highlighted, emphasizing the development of new host-directed antiviral therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Old Drugs with New Tricks: Efficacy of Fluoroquinolones to Suppress Replication of Flaviviruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Antiviral therapies are urgently needed to treat infections with flaviviruses such as Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) virus. Repurposing FDA-approved compounds could provide the fastest route to alleviate the burden of flaviviral diseases. In this study, three fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, difloxacin and ciprofloxacin, curtailed replication of flaviviruses ZIKV, DENV, Langat (LGTV) and Modoc (MODV) in HEK-293 cells at low micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition assays revealed that enoxacin suppressed ZIKV replication when added at 6 hours post-infection, suggesting inhibition of an intermediate step in the virus life cycle, whereas ciprofloxacin and difloxacin had a wider window of efficacy of 2, 6, and 8 hours post-infection for difloxacin and 2 to 8 hours post-infection for ciprofloxacin. The efficacy of enoxacin to suppress ZIKV replication in 5-week-old A129 mice was evaluated in two experiments. First, mice were infected with 1×105 plaque-forming units (pfu) ZIKV FSS13025 (n=20) or PBS (n=11) on day 0 and subsets were treated with enoxacin at 10mg/kg or 15mg/kg or diluent orally twice daily on days 1-5. Treated and control mice did not differ in weight change or virus titer in serum or brain. Mice treated with enoxacin showed a significant, 5-fold decrease in ZIKV titer in testes relative to controls. Second, mice were infected with 1×102 pfu ZIKV (n=13) or PBS (n=13) on day 0 and subsets were treated with 15mg/kg oral enoxacin or diluent twice daily on days 0 (pre-treatment) and 1-5. Mice treated with enoxacin showed a significant, 2.5-fold decrease in ZIKV titer in testes relative to controls, while weight and viral load in the serum, brain, and liver did not differ between treated and control mice. Enoxacin efficacy in cultured murine Sertoli cells was not enhanced compared to efficacy in HEK-293 cells. ZIKV can be sexually transmitted, so reduction of titer in the testes by enoxacin should be further investigated. Author Summary Flaviviruses such as Zika and dengue virus pose a significant threat to public health worldwide, and there are currently no antiviral therapies to treat any flaviviral infection. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs as anti-flaviviral therapies can accelerate clinical use. We demonstrated that fluoroquinolone antibiotics exhibit anti-flaviviral efficacy, suppressing flavivirus replication in cultured human cells. Additionally, we found that the fluoroquinolone enoxacin suppressed Zika virus replication in mouse testes. While Zika virus is primarily transmitted via mosquitoes, the virus also undergoes sexual transmission. The importance of sexual transmission for the overall epidemiology of the virus remains unclear; nonetheless all routes of potential transmission to pregnant women are of concern as fetal infection in utero can have devastating effects. Thus, our data indicate that fluoroquinolones hold promise for treatment of flaviviral infections, particularly infection of the testes by Zika virus, and that this class of drugs warrants further study.

TI  - Oligomeric state of the ZIKV E protein defines protective immune responses
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 10
AB  - The current leading Zika vaccine candidates in clinical testing are based on live or killed virus platforms, which have safety issues, especially in pregnant women. Zika subunit vaccines, however, have shown poor performance in preclinical studies, most likely because the antigens tested do not display critical quaternary structure epitopes present on Zika E protein homodimers that cover the surface of the virus. Here, we produce stable recombinant E protein homodimers that are recognized by strongly neutralizing Zika specific monoclonal antibodies. In mice, the dimeric antigen stimulate strongly neutralizing antibodies that target epitopes that are similar to epitopes recognized by human antibodies following natural Zika virus infection. The monomer antigen stimulates low levels of E-domain III targeting neutralizing antibodies. In a Zika challenge model, only E dimer antigen stimulates protective antibodies, not the monomer. These results highlight the importance of mimicking the highly structured flavivirus surface when designing subunit vaccines. Many human antibodies that neutralize Zika virus recognize quaternary epitopes on the envelope (E) protein. Here, Metz et al. engineer stable recombinant homodimers of Zika virus E protein and show that it induces neutralizing antibodies in mice that recognize similar epitopes as human antibodies from Zika infected people.

TI  - Orthoflavivirus infection and the mTOR signaling pathway
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 16
AB  - Each year, mosquito-borne orthoflaviviruses, including Zika virus, dengue virus, and the Japanese encephalitis virus, threaten the health of more than 400 million people worldwide. To date, knowledge about the pathogenic mechanisms underlying orthoflavivirus infection and the interactions of these viruses with host cells is limited. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is pivotal for cell growth and metabolism. The downstream targets of mTOR regulate protein translation and cell autophagy to affect orthoflavivirus replication, and its upstream protein AKT performs similar functions. In this work, the mechanism underlying the relationship between the mTOR signaling pathway and orthoflavivirus infection was reviewed from three perspectives: orthoflavivirus structure and life cycle, mTOR structure and signaling pathway, and regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway during orthoflavivirus infection.

TI  - Paritaprevir as a pan-antiviral against different flaviviruses
JF  - Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences
VL  - 12
AB  - Introduction The flavivirus infections caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV), Dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV) cause mild to serious pathological conditions, such as fever, joint pain, shock, internal bleeding, organ failure, nausea, breathlessness, brain tissue damage, neurodegenerative diseases, and deaths. As currently no efficient vaccine or drug is available to prevent or treat these diseases in humans, it is essential to identify potential drug-like molecules to treat these diseases. For these reasons, several known anti-viral drugs are repurposed against the proteases of ZIKV, WNV, and DENV to inhibit their activities. Methods The GOLD 5.0 molecular docking program was used to dock 20 HIV and HCV drugs against the ZIKV protease. Based on docking scores, 5 drugs were found to bind to the ZIKV protease with high affinities. Subsequently, the AMBER ff14SB force field was employed to simulate these drug-bound complexes of ZIKV protease. The MM/PBSA free energy method was utilized to compute the binding free energies of these complexes. Consequently, the two best ZIKV protease inhibitors were repurposed against the proteases of DENV and WNV. Results and Discussion It is found that out of the 5 drugs, Ritonavir and Paritaprevir bind to the NS2B-NS3 protease of the ZIKV strongly with the Gibbs binding free energies (∆Gbind) of −17.44±3.18 kcal/mol and −14.25±3.11 kcal/mol respectively. Remarkably, Ritonavir binds to the ZIKV Protease about 12 kcal/mol more strongly compared to its binding to the HIV protease. It is further found that Paritaprevir binds to DENV and WNV proteases as strongly as it binds to the ZIKV protease. Hence it is proposed that Paritaprevir may act as a potent pan-antiviral against the Zika, West Nile, and Dengue viral diseases.

TI  - PARP12 suppresses Zika virus infection through PARP-dependent degradation of NS1 and NS3 viral proteins
JF  - Science Signaling
VL  - 11
AB  - Interferon stimulates the ADP-ribosylation–dependent degradation of nonstructural Zika virus proteins necessary for viral replication. Ribosylation restricts infection Type I interferon signaling drives the expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are critical for host and cellular defense against viral infection. To identify ISGs that limit Zika virus infection, Li et al. screened CRISPR knockout cell lines and found that loss of PARP12 increased viral replication. Truncation and pharmacological inhibition of PARP12 indicated that antiviral activity required the PARP domain–dependent ADP-ribosylation of required viral proteins, which led to their ubiquitylation and degradation. This work identifies a distinct antiviral mechanism and suggests that PARP agonists may have clinical utility if repurposed as treatments for Zika virus. Zika virus infection stimulates a type I interferon (IFN) response in host cells, which suppresses viral replication. Type I IFNs exert antiviral effects by inducing the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To screen for antiviral ISGs that restricted Zika virus replication, we individually knocked out 21 ISGs in A549 lung cancer cells and identified PARP12 as a strong inhibitor of Zika virus replication. Our findings suggest that PARP12 mediated the ADP-ribosylation of NS1 and NS3, nonstructural viral proteins that are involved in viral replication and modulating host defense responses. This modification of NS1 and NS3 triggered their proteasome-mediated degradation. These data increase our understanding of the antiviral activity of PARP12 and suggest a molecular basis for the potential development of therapeutics against Zika virus.

TI  - Participation of Extracellular Vesicles from Zika-Virus-Infected Mosquito Cells in the Modification of Naïve Cells’ Behavior by Mediating Cell-to-Cell Transmission of Viral Elements
JF  - Cells
VL  - 9
AB  - To date, no safe vaccine or antivirals for Zika virus (ZIKV) infection have been found. The pathogenesis of severe Zika, where host and viral factors participate, remains unclear. For the control of Zika, it is important to understand how ZIKV interacts with different host cells. Knowledge of the targeted cellular pathways which allow ZIKV to productively replicate and/or establish prolonged viral persistence contributes to novel vaccines and therapies. Monocytes and endothelial vascular cells are the main ZIKV targets. During the infection process, cells are capable of releasing extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are mediators of intercellular communication. We found that mosquito EVs released from ZIKV-infected (C6/36) cells carry viral RNA and ZIKV-E protein and are able to infect and activate naïve mosquito and mammalian cells. ZIKV C6/36 EVs promote the differentiation of naïve monocytes and induce a pro-inflammatory state with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) mRNA expression. ZIKV C6/36 EVs participate in endothelial vascular cell damage by inducing coagulation (TF) and inflammation (PAR-1) receptors at the endothelial surface of the cell membranes and promote a pro-inflammatory state with increased endothelial permeability. These data suggest that ZIKV C6/36 EVs may contribute to the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection in human hosts.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and has historically been reported to cause mild symptomatic diseases during human infections. More recently, the explosion of microcephaly among infants born to ZIKV-infected women has made ZIKV a global public health concern. While ZIKV causes acute human diseases, infections of vector mosquitoes are basically non-pathogenic, allowing persistent infections and conferring lifelong ability to transmit the virus. Recent studies have revealed that DNA forms of arboviral RNA genomes play a significant role in viral persistence in mosquitoes. We have initiated experiments to determine whether ZIKV generates viral DNA (vDNA) forms following infection in mosquitoes. Here we show that vDNAs are generated following ZIKV infection both in mosquito cell cultures and in its primary vector Aedes aegypti. vDNA formation is more extensive in RNA interference (RNAi)-deficient Aedes albopictus-derived C6/36 cells compared to RNAi-proficient mosquito cells. In addition, vDNAs are generated via multiple template-switching events.

TI  - Peli1 signaling blockade attenuates congenital zika syndrome
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infects pregnant women and causes devastating congenital zika syndrome (CZS). How the virus is vertically transmitted to the fetus and induces neuronal loss remains unclear. We previously reported that Pellino (Peli)1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promotes p38MAPK activation in microglia and induction of lethal encephalitis by facilitating the replication of West Nile virus (WNV), a closely related flavivirus. Here, we found that Peli1 expression was induced on ZIKV-infected human monocytic cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, human first-trimester placental trophoblasts, and neural stem cell (hNSC)s. Peli1 mediates ZIKV cell attachment, entry and viral translation and its expression is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, Peli1 mediated inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses and induced cell death in placental trophoblasts and hNSCs. ZIKV-infected pregnant mice lacking Peli1 signaling had reduced placental inflammation and tissue damage, which resulted in attenuated congenital abnormalities. Smaducin-6, a membrane-tethered Smad6-derived peptide, blocked Peli1-mediated NF-κB activation but did not have direct effects on ZIKV infection. Smaducin-6 reduced inflammatory responses and cell death in placental trophoblasts and hNSCs, and diminished placental inflammation and damage, leading to attenuated congenital malformations in mice. Collectively, our results reveal a novel role of Peli1 in flavivirus pathogenesis and suggest that Peli1 promotes ZIKV vertical transmission and neuronal loss by mediating inflammatory cytokine responses and induction of cell death. Our results also identify Smaducin-6 as a potential therapeutic candidate for treatment of CZS.

TI  - Peripheral nervous system is injured by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) elicited by nonstructural (NS) protein‐1 from Zika virus
JF  - The FASEB Journal
VL  - 37
AB  - The involvement of innate immune mediators to the Zika virus (ZIKV)‐induced neuroinflammation is not yet well known. Here, we investigated whether neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are scaffolds of DNA associated with proteins, have the potential to injure peripheral nervous. The tissue lesions were evaluated after adding NETs to dorsal root ganglia (DRG) explants and to DRG constituent cells or injecting them into mouse sciatic nerves. Identification of NET harmful components was achieved by pharmacological inhibition of NET constituents. We found that ZIKV inoculation into sciatic nerves recruited neutrophils and elicited the production of the cytokines CXCL1 and IL‐1β, classical NET inducers, but did not trigger NET formation. ZIKV blocked PMA‐ and CXCL8‐induced NET release, but, in contrast, the ZIKV nonstructural protein (NS)‐1 induced NET formation. NET‐enriched supernatants were toxic to DRG explants, decreasing neurite area, length, and arborization. NETs were toxic to DRG constituent cells and affected myelinating cells. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and histones were identified as the harmful component of NETs. NS1 injection into mouse sciatic nerves recruited neutrophils and triggered NET release and caspase‐3 activation, events that were also elicited by the injection of purified MPO. In summary, we found that ZIKV NS1 protein induces NET formation, which causes nervous tissue damages. Our findings reveal new mechanisms leading to neuroinflammation by ZIKV.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and Safety of the Nucleoside Analog Antiviral Drug Galidesivir Administered to Healthy Adult Subjects
JF  - Clinical Pharmacology in Drug Development
VL  - 11
AB  - Galidesivir (BCX4430) is an adenosine nucleoside analog broadly active in cell culture against multiple RNA virus families, and active in animal models of viral diseases associated with Ebola, Marburg, yellow fever, Zika, and Rift Valley fever. Current studies demonstrated the pharmacokinetics and safety of the first‐in‐human evaluations of galidesivir as intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) formulations. Two double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, dose‐ranging studies were conducted enrolling 126 healthy subjects. Study 1 evaluated the safety and tolerability of IM galidesivir over single day dosing, single day dosing ± lidocaine, and 7‐day dosing with lidocaine. Study 2 evaluated the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of IV galidesivir. Safety and tolerability were evaluated via clinical and laboratory monitoring. The plasma concentration–time profile of galidesivir at doses 0.3 to 10 mg/kg IM was characterized by rapid absorption, an initial rapid distribution and clearance phase, and an extended terminal elimination phase. The initial rapid distribution and extended terminal elimination were mimicked in the profile of galidesivir at doses 5 to 20 mg/kg IV. No fatal events or related serious adverse events were reported. No clinically significant dose‐related trends in laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms, or echocardiograms were noted. Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated.

TI  - Phosphatidylethanolamine and Phosphatidylserine Synergize To Enhance GAS6/AXL-Mediated Virus Infection and Efferocytosis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are usually sequestered to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the healthy eukaryotic cells. During apoptosis, these phospholipids move to the cell’s outer leaflet where they are recognized by so-called PS receptors on surveilling phagocytes. Several pathogenic families of enveloped viruses hijack these PS receptors to gain entry into their target cells. Here, we show that efficiency of these processes is enhanced, namely, PE synergizes with PS to promote PS receptor-mediated virus infection and clearance of apoptotic cells. These findings deepen our understanding of how these fundamental biological processes are executed. ABSTRACT Phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors mediate clearance of apoptotic cells—efferocytosis—by recognizing the PS exposed on those cells. They also mediate the entry of enveloped viruses by binding PS in the virion membrane. Here, we show that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synergizes with PS to enhance PS receptor-mediated efferocytosis and virus entry. The presence of PE on the same surface as PS dramatically enhances recognition of PS by PS-binding proteins such as GAS6, PROS, and TIM1. Liposomes containing both PE and PS bound to GAS6 and were engulfed by AXL-expressing cells much more efficiently than those containing PS alone. Further, infection of AXL-expressing cells by infectious Zika virus or Ebola, Chikungunya, or eastern equine encephalitis pseudoviruses was inhibited with greater efficiency by the liposomes containing both PS and PE compared to a mixture of liposomes separately composed of PS and PE. These data demonstrate that simultaneous recognition of PE and PS maximizes PS receptor-mediated virus entry and efferocytosis and underscore the important contribution of PE in these major biological processes. IMPORTANCE Phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are usually sequestered to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the healthy eukaryotic cells.

TI  - PIM1 kinase facilitates Zika virus replication by suppressing host cells’ natural immunity
JF  - Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy
VL  - 6
AB  - Dear Editors, Oncoprotein PIM1 kinase participates in many important biological processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, carcinogenesis and tumorigenesis, by phosphorylating cellular substrates. More recently, several groups discovered that PIM1 affects (+) ssRNA virus transcription and modulates virus infection, such as human rhinovirus (HRV)-16 and hepatitis C virus (HCV). We recently reported that PIM1 enhances EV-A71 IRES activity by regulating AUF1 translocation. However, its function in ZIKV infection has not been explored. Interestingly, after we revisited unbiased RNA-sequencing data obtained from ZIKV-infected Vero cells and further analyzed the genes with significant changes; the results from the KEGG pathway showed that ZIKV infection affects many pathways, including pathways in cancer, virus infection, viral carcinogenesis, spliceosome, and the cell cycle (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The upregulation of PIM1 expression attracted our attention (Fig. 1a) because it had a pattern similar to that of infection with the (+)ssRNA virus EV-A71 and exhibited important roles in EV-A71 reproduction in another study. To confirm our findings, we examined the mRNA levels of PIM1 in RD cells 48 h postinfection (h.p.i.) with ZIKV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. The results showed that the mRNA level of PIM1 was upregulated at least 6-fold between 24 h and 72 h after ZIKV infection (Fig. 1b). We also observed that PIM1 protein levels were significantly upregulated in both RD and A549 cells 48 h after ZIKV infection (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). We ectopically expressed ZIKV structure proteins (prM, capsid) and nostructure proteins in HEK293T cells for 48 h. Almost all the tested ZIKV proteins (except prM) induced PIM1 expression; in particular, NS3, NS4B, and NS5 strongly stimulated PIM1 expression (Fig. 1c). To reveal the role of PIM1 in ZIKV infection, we knocked down PIM1 by using two different siRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Forty-eight hours after siRNA transfection, we infected the cells with ZIKV at MOI of 1. PIM1 knockdown protected A549 cells from the cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by ZIKV infection (Fig. 1d). The expression level of a viral protein (envelope) was significantly decreased in the PIM1-depleted RD and A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d). The ectopic expression of PIM1 strongly increased envelope protein expression in both the RD and A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2e, f). Intriguingly, both the intracellular and extracellular viral RNA levels were decreased in the PIM1-depleted RD and A549 cells 24 h.p.i. (Fig. 1e, f, Supplementary Fig. 2g, h). Obviously, the levels of both the intracellular viral RNA and extracellular virion RNA were significantly increased in the RD and A549 cells with ectopically expressed PIM1 24 h.p.i. (Fig. 1g, h, Supplementary Fig. 2i, j). Examining the immunofluorescence assay results, we observed loci with strong viral replication, whereas no obvious ZIKV replication loci were detected in the PIM1-depleted RD cells 24 h.p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 2k). To determine whether PIM1 kinase activity is essential for facilitating ZIKV replication, we first knocked down the endogenous PIM1 with a siRNA targeting the 3’-UTR and then ectopically expressed PIM1 or a kinase-inactivated PIM1 mutant (K67M) in RD cells for 48 h and then infected them with ZIKV at an MOI of 1 and measured the levels after 24 h. Our results showed that the reduced envelope protein level caused by PIM1 depletion was completely restored by the ectopic PIM1 expression, but no restoration was observed in the cells with ectopic expression of K67M mutant (Fig. 1i). In addition, the expression levels of NS5 and NS1 were also rescued by ectopically expressing PIM1 after ZIKV infection in the PIM1-depleted RD cells (Supplementary Fig. 2l). The effects of PIM1 inhibitors (CX-6258, SGI-1776 and AZD1208) were tested on ZIKV infection in both RD and A549 cells. We pretreated RD and A549 cells for 2 h with each inhibitor at different concentrations and then infected them with ZIKV at MOI of 1. Twenty-four hours later, we found that the envelope protein level was remarkably repressed by PIM1 inhibitors in a dosedependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 3a–f). The intracellular replicated viral RNA level was also markedly decreased, by over 90%, in the cells treated with PIM1 inhibitors at a concentration of 8 μM (Supplementary Fig. 3g–i). More importantly, the viral titer was decreased more than 100to 1000-fold by the PIM1 inhibitors (Fig. 1j-l). In addition, we directly observed the potent inhibition of PIM1-induced ZIKV replication by CX-6258 under a fluorescence microscope 24 h.p.i. (Fig. 1m). To further address the mechanism by which PIM1 may be involved in promoting ZIKV replication, we treated HEK293T and A549 cells with CX-6258 at 4 μM for 24 h and took advantage of RNA-sequencing technology for transcriptome assays. Our results showed that the expression of many genes had significantly changed (Supplementary Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table). KEGG pathway assays showed that PIM1 is involved in many pathways mostly involved in cancer development, such as MARK signaling and p53 signaling (Fig. 1n). PIM1 was also found to be involved in many virus infection pathways, such as hepatitis B virus, EpsteinBarr virus and human papilloma virus infection (Fig. 1n). More interestingly, inhibition of PIM1 kinase activity upregulated important downstream genes associated with antiviral responses that play crucial roles in the cellular type I IFN signaling pathway for antiviral activity (Supplementary Table). APOBEC3H, APOBEC3C, PML, OASL and TRIM5 were found upregulated in both HEK293T and A549 cells. These interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were upregulated by CX-6258 in a dose-dependent manner in both HEK293T and A549 cells (Fig. 1p and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Similar results were also obtained by silencing PIM1 with siRNA in both HEK293T and A549 cells (Fig. 1q and Supplementary Fig. 4c). The p-STAT1/p-STAT2 complex must undergo nuclear translocation to transactivate ISGs involved in antiviral activity. We then tested whether PIM1 affected the type I IFN signaling pathway by regulating the phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT2. Our results showed that upon silencing of PIM1 phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT2 was upregulated in the HEK293T cells

TI  - PKR-mediated stress response enhances dengue and Zika virus replication
JF  - mBio
VL  - 14
AB  - ABSTRACT The mechanisms by which flaviviruses use non-canonical translation to support their replication in host cells are largely unknown. Here, we investigated how the integrated stress response (ISR), which promotes translational arrest by eIF2ɑ phosphorylation (p-eIF2ɑ), regulates flavivirus replication. During dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, eIF2ɑ phosphorylation peaked at 24 hours post-infection and was dependent on protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) but not type I interferon. The ISR is activated downstream of p-eIF2α during infection with either virus, but translation arrest only occurred following DENV4 infection. Despite this difference, both DENV4 and ZIKV replications were impaired in cells lacking PKR, independent of type I interferon/NF-kB signaling or cell viability. By using a ZIKV 5′-untranslated region (UTR) reporter system as a model, we found that this region of the genome is sufficient to promote an enhancement of viral mRNA translation in the presence of an active ISR. Together, we provide evidence that flaviviruses escape ISR translational arrest and co-opt this response to increase viral replication. IMPORTANCE One of the fundamental features that make viruses intracellular parasites is the necessity to use cellular translational machinery. Hence, this is a crucial checkpoint for controlling infections. Here, we show that dengue and Zika viruses, responsible for nearly 400 million infections every year worldwide, explore such control for optimal replication. Using immunocompetent cells, we demonstrate that arrest of protein translations happens after sensing of dsRNA and that the information required to avoid this blocking is contained in viral 5′-UTR. Our work, therefore, suggests that the non-canonical translation described for these viruses is engaged when the intracellular stress response is activated.

TI  - Placental Alkaline Phosphatase Promotes Zika Virus Replication by Stabilizing Viral Proteins through BIP
JF  - mBio
VL  - 11
AB  - ZIKV is a recently emerged mosquito-borne flavivirus that can cause devastating congenital Zika syndrome in pregnant women and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults, but how ZIKV specifically targets the placenta is not well understood. Here, we identified an alkaline phosphatase (ALPP) that is expressed primarily in placental tissue and promotes ZIKV infection by colocalizing with ZIKV proteins and preventing their proteasome-mediated degradation. The phosphatase activity of ALPP could be required for optimal ZIKV infection, and ALPP is stabilized by BIP via its chaperone activity. This report provides novel insights into host factors required for ZIKV infection, which potentially has implications for ZIKV infection of the placenta. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy causes intrauterine growth defects and microcephaly, but knowledge of the mechanism through which ZIKV infects and replicates in the placenta remains elusive. Here, we found that ALPP, an alkaline phosphatase expressed primarily in placental tissue, promoted ZIKV infection in both human placental trophoblasts and astrocytoma cells. ALPP bound to ZIKV structural and nonstructural proteins and thereby prevented their proteasome-mediated degradation and enhanced viral RNA replication and virion biogenesis. In addition, the function of ALPP in ZIKV infection depends on its phosphatase activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ALPP was stabilized through interactions with BIP, which is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident heat shock protein 70 chaperone. The chaperone activity of BIP promoted ZIKV infection and mediated the interaction between ALPP and ZIKV proteins. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism through which ALPP facilitates ZIKV replication by coordinating with the BIP protein.

TI  - Placenta‐derived interferon‐stimulated gene 20 controls ZIKA virus infection
JF  - EMBO reports
VL  - 22
AB  - Zika virus is a positive‐sense single‐stranded RNA virus, which can be transmitted across the placenta and has adverse effects on fetal development during pregnancy. The severity of these complications highlights the importance of prevention and treatment. However, no vaccines or drugs are currently available. In this study, we characterize the IFNβ‐mediated anti‐viral response in trophoblast cells in order to identify critical components that are necessary for the successful control of viral replication and determine whether components of the IFN‐induced response can be used as a replacement therapy for ZIKA virus infection during pregnancy. We identify and characterize interferon‐stimulated gene 20 (ISG20) as playing a central role in controlling Zika virus infection in trophoblast cells and successfully establish a recombinant ISG20‐Fc protein that effectively decreases viral titers in vitro and in vivo by maintaining its exonuclease activity and displaying potential immune modulatory functions. Recombinant ISG20‐Fc has thus the potential to be further developed as an anti‐viral treatment against ZIKA viral infection in high‐risk populations, particularly in pregnant women.

TI  - Pleiotropic Odorant-Binding Proteins Promote Aedes aegypti Reproduction and Flavivirus Transmission
JF  - mBio
VL  - 12
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the major vector for many arthropod-borne viral diseases, such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. Previous studies suggested that odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) may have diverse physiological functions beyond the olfactory system in mosquitoes; however, these hypothesized functions have not yet been demonstrated. ABSTRACT Insect odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are small soluble proteins that have been assigned roles in olfaction, but their other potential functions have not been extensively explored. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of Aedes aegypti Obp10 and Obp22, we demonstrate the pleiotropic contribution of these proteins to multiple processes that are essential for vectorial capacity. Mutant mosquitoes have impaired host-seeking and oviposition behavior, reproduction, and arbovirus transmission. Here, we show that Obp22 is linked to the male-determining sex locus (M) on chromosome 1 and is involved in male reproduction, likely by mediating the development of spermatozoa. Although OBP10 and OBP22 are not involved in flavivirus replication, abolition of these proteins significantly reduces transmission of dengue and Zika viruses through a mechanism affecting secretion of viral particles into the saliva. These results extend our current understanding of the role of insect OBPs in insect reproduction and transmission of human pathogens, making them essential determinants of vectorial capacity. IMPORTANCE Aedes aegypti is the major vector for many arthropod-borne viral diseases, such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. Previous studies suggested that odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) may have diverse physiological functions beyond the olfactory system in mosquitoes; however, these hypothesized functions have not yet been demonstrated. Here, we have used CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing to functionally delete (knock out) Obp10 and Obp22 in Aedes aegypti. We showed that disruption of Obp10 or Obp22 significantly impairs female and male reproductive capacity by adversely affecting blood feeding, oviposition, fecundity and fertility, and the development of spermatozoa. We also showed that disruption of Obp10 or Obp22 significantly reduces the transmission of dengue and Zika viruses through a mechanism affecting secretion of viral particles into the saliva. Thus, our study is not only significant in understanding the functions of OBPs in mosquito biology, but also shows that OBPs may represent potent flavivirus transmission-blocking targets. Our study is in this regard particularly timely and important from a translational and public health perspective.

AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) is primarily transmitted via an infected mosquito bite, during sexual intercourse, or in utero mother to child transmission. When a fetus is infected, both neurological malformations and deficits in brain development are frequently manifested. As such, there is a need for vaccines or drugs that may be used to cure ZIKV infections. Metabolic pathways play a crucial role in cell differentiation and development. More importantly, polyamines play a key role in replication and translation of several RNA viruses, including ZIKV, Dengue virus, and Chikungunya virus. Here, we present polyamine analogues (BENSpm and PG11047) and their corresponding polymer prodrug derivatives for inhibiting ZIKV infection by intersecting with polyamine catabolism pathways. We tested the compounds against ZIKV African (MR766) and Asian (PRVABC59) strains in human kidney epithelial (Vero) and glioblastoma derived (SNB-19) cell lines. Our results demonstrate potent inhibition of ZIKV viral replication in both cell lines tested. This antiviral effect was mediated by the upregulation of two polyamine catabolic enzymes, spermine oxidase, and spermidine (SMOX)/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT1) as apparent reduction of the ZIKV infection following heterologous expression of SMOX and SAT1. On the basis of these observations, we infer potential use of these polyamine analogues to treat ZIKV infections.

JF  - Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics
VL  - 39
SP  - 6008
EP  - 6020
AB  - Abstract ZIKV belongs to a flavivirus family in which class II fusion proteins involve a low pH-dependent membrane fusion leading to infection of host cells. Envelope (E) protein is primarily responsible for the viral host membrane fusion and is the major target for inhibiting viral entry. Our findings reveal that compounds like PGG, Parishin A, and Stevioside have shown a high affinity for E protein and found to be active against various other viral infections. The binding of these molecules to E protein was found to decrease the RMSD and RMSF values of the ligand protein complex and restricted the Radius of Gyration in molecular dynamics simulation analysis. Further, the binding free energy calculations suggested the stability of complexes throughout simulations trajectory that could reduce the flexibility of the linker so as to block the folding back event of membrane fusion. A recent study has shown that PGG inhibits the early stages of viral entry in HCV and ZIKV. Therefore, we propose that PGG inhibits the entry of virion via binding the E protein and restricting the conformational rearrangement during membrane fusion. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

JF  - Journal of Innate Immunity
VL  - 13
SP  - 179
EP  - 193
AB  - Expression of host noncoding RNAs and coding mRNAs is significantly altered by viral infection. In the current study, we screened the transcriptional profile of human lung epithelial A549 cells infected with Zika virus (ZIKV) by microarray assay. Seventy-nine long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 140 mRNAs were differentially expressed (DE). The bioinformatics analysis revealed that the mRNAs adjacent to the DE lncRNAs were closely related to the host responses to viral infection. We selected 7 lncRNAs from the top 50 hits for validation. The quantitative real-time PCR data confirmed that expression of selected lncRNAs was induced by ZIKV infection. Moreover, the expression of 7 lncRNAs was induced by infection of dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, or vesicular stomatitis virus, or by treatment of poly(I:C) and IFN-β. Furthermore, loss of innate immune adaptor IPS-1 or receptor IFNAR1 resulted in lower induction levels of several lncRNAs by ZIKV. Overexpression of 3 lncRNAs (RPL27-OT1, OASL-IT1, and REC8-OT3) reduced the virus yields of ZIKV. Knockout of OASL-IT1 significantly enhanced ZIKV replication. In OASL-IT1 knockout cells, the levels of interferons (IFNs) and the activation of 3 innate immune signaling pathways triggered by ZIKV were dramatically reduced. Collectively, our work found a positive feedback loop in the IFN system, in which IFNs and OASL-IT1 regulate each other, thereby promoting establishment of antiviral defense.

AB  - Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a master regulator of metabolism, adipogenesis, inflammation and cell cycle, and it has been extensively studied in the brain in relation to inflammation or neurodegeneration. Little is known however about its role in viral infections of the brain parenchyma, although they represent the most frequent cause of encephalitis and are a major threat for the developing brain. Specific to viral infections is the ability to subvert signaling pathways of the host cell to ensure virus replication and spreading, as deleterious as the consequences may be for the host. In this respect, the pleiotropic role of PPARγ makes it a critical target of infection. This review aims to provide an update on the role of PPARγ in viral infections of the brain. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of PPARγ in brain or neural cells infected by immunodeficiency virus 1, Zika virus, or human cytomegalovirus. They have provided a better understanding on PPARγ functions in the infected brain, and revealed that it can be a double-edged sword with respect to inflammation, viral replication, or neuronogenesis. They unraveled new roles of PPARγ in health and disease and could possibly help designing new therapeutic strategies.

TI  - pr-independent biogenesis of infectious mature Zika virus particles
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Flavivirus assembly at the endoplasmic reticulum is driven by the structural proteins envelope (E) and premembrane (prM). Here, contrary to the established paradigm for flavivirus assembly, we demonstrate that the biogenesis of flavivirus particles does not require an intact prM nor proteolytic activation. The expression of E preceded by a truncated version of prM (M-E) was sufficient for the formation of non-infectious Zika virus subviral particles and pseudo-infectious reporter virions. Subviral particles encoded by a ZIKV M-E DNA vaccine elicited a neutralizing antibody response that was insensitive to the virion maturation state, a feature of flavivirus humoral immunity shown to correlate with protection. M-E vaccines that uniformly present structural features shared with mature virions offer a higher quality and broadly applicable approach to flavivirus vaccination.

TI  - Predominant role of IPS-1 over TRIF adaptor proteins in early innate immune response against Zika virus in mice.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 99 2
SP  - 209
EP  - 218
AB  - Toll-like receptors and RNA helicases are involved in the control of RNA virus infection through production of type I interferons (IFNs). To delineate the relative contributions of these signalling pathways in the innate immune response and the control of Zika virus (ZIKV) pathogenesis, the impact of a deficiency in TRIF and/or IPS-1 adaptor proteins was investigated in mice. Mice were infected intravenously with ZIKV and monitored for clinical signs for 14 days. Groups of mice were sacrificed on days 1, 3 and 7 post-infection (p.i.) and viral RNA was measured by digital droplet PCR in serum, spleen, brain and eyes. Some mice were sacrificed at 12 h p.i. for determination of the levels of IFN-α/-β (ELISA), cytokines/chemokines (Luminex) and total/phosphorylated IRF3 and IRF7 (Western blotting). All groups of mice infected with ZIKV exhibited no clinical signs of infection. However, IPS-1-/- and TRIF-/-xIPS-1-/- mice developed higher viraemia than WT and TRIF-/- groups on days 1, 3 and 7. TRIF-/-xIPS-1-/- mice presented higher viral RNA levels in spleen, brain and eyes over time than TRIF-/-, IPS-1-/- and WT groups. At 12 h, IFN-α/-β and cytokine/chemokine levels in spleen were significantly decreased in IPS-1-/- and TRIF-/-xIPS-1-/- compared to WT and TRIF-/-. On day 1 p.i., IFN-β levels were significantly reduced in spleen of TRIF-/-xIPS-1-/- mice compared to all other groups. These data suggest that IPS-1 plays a more important role than TRIF in the early type I IFN response and that both IPS-1 and TRIF are involved at later stages of ZIKV infection.

TI  - Pregnancy Alters Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses to Zika Virus Infection in the Reproductive Tract
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 205
SP  - 3107
EP  - 3121
AB  - Key Points Pregnancy results in recruitment of tolerogenic dendritic cells to the uterus. Pregnancy results in lessened IL-12 responses to Zika virus infection. Pregnant mice have fewer Ag-experienced T cells after Zika infection. Recent outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) have been associated with birth defects, including microcephaly and neurologic impairment. However, the mechanisms that confer potential susceptibility to ZIKV during pregnancy remain unclear. We hypothesized that poor outcomes from ZIKV infection during pregnancy are due in part to pregnancy-induced alteration of innate immune cell frequencies and cytokine expression. To examine the impact of pregnancy on innate immune responses, we inoculated immunocompetent pregnant and nonpregnant female C57BL/6 mice with 5 × 105 focus-forming units of ZIKV intravaginally. Innate immune cell frequencies and cytokine expression were measured by flow cytometry at day 3 postinfection. Compared with nonpregnant mice, pregnant mice exhibited higher frequencies of uterine macrophages (CD68+) and CD11c+ CD103+ and CD11c+ CD11b+ dendritic cells. Additionally, ZIKV-infected pregnant mice had lower frequencies of CD45+ IL-12+ and CD11b+ IL-12+ cells in the uterus and spleen. Next, we measured the frequencies of Ag-experienced CD4 (CD4+ CD11a+ CD49d+) and CD8 (CD8lo CD11ahi) T cells at day 10 postinfection to determine the impact of pregnancy-associated changes in innate cellular IL-12 responses on the adaptive immune response. We found that pregnant mice had lower frequencies of uterine Ag-experienced CD4 T cells and ZIKV-infected pregnant mice had lower frequencies of uterine Ag-experienced CD8 T cells compared with ZIKV-infected nonpregnant mice. These data show that pregnancy results in altered innate and adaptive immune responses to ZIKV infection in the reproductive tract of mice and that pregnancy-associated immune modulation may play an important role in the severity of acute ZIKV infection.

TI  - Primary Human Placental Trophoblasts are Permissive for Zika Virus (ZIKV) Replication
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne (Aedes genus) arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family. Although ZIKV has been predominately associated with a mild or asymptomatic dengue-like disease, its appearance in the Americas has been accompanied by a multi-fold increase in reported incidence of fetal microcephaly and brain malformations. The source and mode of vertical transmission from mother to fetus is presumptively transplacental, although a causal link explaining the interval delay between maternal symptoms and observed fetal malformations following infection has been missing. In this study, we show that primary human placental trophoblasts from non-exposed donors (n = 20) can be infected by primary passage ZIKV-FLR isolate, and uniquely allowed for ZIKV viral RNA replication when compared to dengue virus (DENV). Consistent with their being permissive for ZIKV infection, primary trophoblasts expressed multiple putative ZIKV cell entry receptors, and cellular function and differentiation were preserved. These findings suggest that ZIKV-FLR strain can replicate in human placental trophoblasts without host cell destruction, thereby serving as a likely permissive reservoir and portal of fetal transmission with risk of latent microcephaly and malformations.

TI  - Probing Molecular Insights into Zika Virus–Host Interactions
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 10
AB  - The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Americas surprised all of us because of its rapid spread and association with neurologic disorders including fetal microcephaly, brain and ocular anomalies, and Guillain–Barré syndrome. In response to this global health crisis, unprecedented and world-wide efforts are taking place to study the ZIKV-related human diseases. Much has been learned about this virus in the areas of epidemiology, genetic diversity, protein structures, and clinical manifestations, such as consequences of ZIKV infection on fetal brain development. However, progress on understanding the molecular mechanism underlying ZIKV-associated neurologic disorders remains elusive. To date, we still lack a good understanding of; (1) what virologic factors are involved in the ZIKV-associated human diseases; (2) which ZIKV protein(s) contributes to the enhanced viral pathogenicity; and (3) how do the newly adapted and pandemic ZIKV strains alter their interactions with the host cells leading to neurologic defects? The goal of this review is to explore the molecular insights into the ZIKV–host interactions with an emphasis on host cell receptor usage for viral entry, cell innate immunity to ZIKV, and the ability of ZIKV to subvert antiviral responses and to cause cytopathic effects. We hope this literature review will inspire additional molecular studies focusing on ZIKV–host Interactions.

TI  - Protein kinase R induced by type I interferons is a main regulator of reactive microglia in Zika virus infection
JF  - Glia
VL  - 73
SP  - 80
EP  - 104
AB  - Microglial cells are the phagocytic cells of the brain that under physiological conditions participate in brain homeostasis and surveillance. Under pathogenic states, microglia undergoes strong morphological and transcriptional changes potentially leading to sustained neuroinflammation, brain damage, and cognitive disorders. Postnatal and adult Zika virus (ZIKV) brain infection is characterized by the induction of reactive microglia associated with brain inflammation, synapse loss and neuropathogenesis. Contrary to neurons, microglial cells are not infected by ZIKV thus raising the question of the mechanism governing ZIKV‐induced microglia's reactivity. In this work, we have questioned the role of exogenous, neuronal type I interferons (IFNs‐I) in regulating ZIKV‐induced microglia's reactivity. Primary cultured microglial cells were either treated with conditioned media from ZIKV‐infected mature neurons or co‐cultured with ZIKV‐infected neurons. Using either an antibody directed against the IFNAR receptor that neutralizes the IFNs‐I response or Ifnar−/−microglial cells, we demonstrate that IFNs‐I produced by ZIKV‐infected neurons are the main regulators of the phagocytic capacity and the pro‐inflammatory gene expression profile of reactive, non‐infected microglial cells. We identify protein kinase R (PKR), whose expression is activated by IFNs‐I, as a major regulator of the phagocytic capacity, pro‐inflammatory response, and morphological changes of microglia induced by IFNs‐I while up‐regulating STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF1 expression. Results obtained herein in vitro with primary cultured cells and in vivo in ZIKV‐infected adult immunocompetent mice, unravel a role for IFNs‐I and PKR in directly regulating microglia's reactivity that could be at work in other infectious and non‐infectious brain pathologies.

TI  - Proteomics of ZIKV infected amniotic fluids of microcephalic fetuses reveals extracellular matrix and immune system dysregulation
JF  - PROTEOMICS – Clinical Applications
VL  - 16
AB  - During pregnancy, the vertical transmission of the Zika virus (ZIKV) can cause some disorders in the fetus, called Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). Several efforts have been made to understand the molecular mechanism of the CZS. However, the study of CZS pathogenesis through infected human samples is scarce. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to identify and understand the biological processes affected by CZS development. We analyzed by a shotgun proteomic approach the amniotic fluid of pregnant women infected with Zika carrying microcephalic (MC+) or non‐microcephalic (Z+) fetuses compared to Zika negative controls (CTR). Several groups of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins were dysregulated in the Z+ and MC+ patients, triggering an opposite dysregulation. The down‐regulation of the ECM proteins in the MC+ groups can be another factor that contributes to CZS. On the contrary, the Z+ group could be developing a neuroprotective response through ECM proteins up‐regulation. The neutrophil degranulation process was disrupted in the Z+ and MC+ groups, where the MC+ groups showed a complex dysregulation. These results suggest that the microcephalic phenotypes are modulated by a down‐regulation of the ECM and the impairment of the innate immune system processes.

TI  - Quantitative electrostatic force tomography for virus capsids in interaction with an approaching nanoscale probe.
JF  - Nanoscale
AB  - Electrostatic interactions are crucial for the assembly, disassembly and stability of proteinaceous viral capsids. Moreover, at the molecular scale, elucidating the organization and structure of the capsid proteins in response to an approaching nanoprobe is a major challenge in biomacromolecular research. Here, we report on a generalized electrostatic model, based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, that quantifies the subnanometric electrostatic interactions between an AFM tip and a proteinaceous capsid from molecular snapshots. This allows us to describe the contributions of specific amino acids and atoms to the interaction force. We show validation results in terms of total electrostatic forces with previous semi-empirical generalized models at available length scales (d > 1 nm). Then, we studied the interaction of the Zika capsid with conical and spherical AFM tips in a tomography-type analysis to identify the most important residues and atoms, showing the localized nature of the interaction. This method can be employed for the interpretation of force microscopy experiments in fundamental virological characterization and in diverse nanomedicine applications, where specific regions of the protein cages are aimed to electrostatically interact with molecular sized functionalized inhibitors, or tailoring protein-cage functional properties for nucleic acid delivery.

TI  - RAB1B interacts with TRAF3 to promote antiviral innate immunity
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Nucleic acid-based antiviral innate immunity activates a signaling cascade that induces type I and type III interferons (IFNs), and other cytokines. This signaling, which is highly regulated, is initiated by pattern recognition receptors, such as RIG-I, that sense viral RNA and then signal to the adaptor protein, MAVS. This adaptor protein then recruits additional signaling proteins, including TRAF3 and TBK1, to form a signaling complex that results in IRF3 activation for transcriptional induction of IFN. Here, we show that the GTPase trafficking protein RAB1B positively regulates RIG-I signaling to promote IFN-β induction and the antiviral response. Over-expression of RAB1B increases RIG-I-mediated signaling to IFN-β, while deletion results in reduced signaling of this pathway. Additionally, this loss of RAB1B results in a dampened antiviral response, as Zika virus infection is enhanced in the absence of RAB1B. Importantly, we identified the mechanism of RAB1B action by determining that it interacts with TRAF3 to facilitate the interaction of TRAF3 with MAVS. Thus, we identified RAB1B as a regulator of TRAF3 to promote the formation of innate immune signaling complexes in response to nucleic acid sensing.

Confirmed existence of ZIKV in semen and sexually transmission of ZIKV suggested that it can break the blood–testis barrier (BTB), or Sertoli cell barrier (SCB). However, little is known about the underlying mechanism. In this study, interaction between actin, an important component of the SCB, and ZIKV envelope (E) protein domain III (EDIII) was inferred from co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis. Confocal microscopy confirmed the role of actin filaments (F-actin) in ZIKV infection, during which part of the stress fibers, the bundles that constituted by paralleled actin filaments, were disrupted and presented in the cell periphery. Colocalization of E and reorganized actin filaments in the cell periphery of transfected Sertoli cells suggests a participation of ZIKV E protein in ZIKV-induced F-actin rearrangement. Perturbation of F-actin by cytochalasin D (CytoD) or Jasplakinolide (Jas) enhanced the infection of ZIKV. More importantly, the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of an in vitro mouse SCB (mSCB) model declined with the progression of ZIKV infection or overexpression of E protein. Co-IP and confocal microscopy analyses revealed that the interaction between F-actin and tight junction protein ZO-1 was reduced after ZIKV infection or E protein overexpression, highlighting the role of E protein in ZIKV-induced disruption of the BTB. We conclude that the interaction between ZIKV E and F-actin leads to the reorganization of F-actin network, thereby compromising BTB integrity.

AB  - Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that can lead to Guillain-Barré syndrome or encephalitis in some individuals and hence presents a serious public health risk. Since the first outbreak of ZIKV in Brazil in 2015, no effective clinical inhibitors have been developed, making the development of effective ZIKV drugs an urgent issue that needs to be addressed. ZIKV belongs to the Flaviviridae family, and its structure includes three structural proteins, namely, capsular (C), premembrane (prM), and envelope (E) proteins, as well as seven nonstructural proteins, namely, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5. To provide a reference for the development of future ZIKV drugs, this paper reviews the structure of the ZIKV based on recent literature reports, analyzes the potential therapeutic targets of various proteins, and proposes feasible drug design strategies. Additionally, this paper reviews and classifies the latest research progress on several protease inhibitors, such as E protein inhibitors, NS2B-NS3 inhibitors, and NS5 inhibitors, so that researchers can quickly understand the current status of development and the interconnections among these inhibitors.

TI  - Recognition of Aedes aegypti Mosquito Saliva Protein LTRIN by the Human Receptor LTβR for Controlling the Immune Response
JF  - Biology
VL  - 13
AB  - Simple Summary In this study, we present the characterization of Aedes aegypti mosquito salivary protein, LTRIN (lymphotoxin β receptor inhibitor), a key facilitator of ZIKV transmission. Injected into the human host during blood-feeding, LTRIN interacts with the human receptor LTβR. We found that LTRIN exists as a thermostable protein with homodimers consisting of an alpha helix-dominant secondary structure with two EF-hand motifs, crucial for withstanding temperature fluctuations during blood-feeding. Despite being an EF-hand protein, its secondary structure remains unaffected by Ca2+ binding. ELISA assays and HDX-MS experiments identified the binding region of LTRIN with LTβR. Disrupting the calcium-binding ability in the second EF-hand motif significantly impacted the interaction between LTRIN, particularly the 15 kDa C-terminal protein, ΔLTRIN, and LTβR. Moreover, the decrease in binding affinity of full-length LTRIN suggests the presence of only the truncated form, ΔLTRIN, in the mosquito’s saliva, as the N-terminal region likely covers the interaction site. This insight provides a basis for developing inhibitors against LTRIN as a potential treatment or vaccine target for ZIKV. Abstract Salivary proteins from mosquitoes have received significant attention lately due to their potential to develop therapeutic treatments or vaccines for mosquito-borne diseases. Here, we report the characterization of LTRIN (lymphotoxin beta receptor inhibitor), a salivary protein known to enhance the pathogenicity of ZIKV by interrupting the LTβR-initiated NF-κB signaling pathway and, therefore, diminish the immune responses. We demonstrated that the truncated C-terminal LTRIN (ΔLTRIN) is a dimeric protein with a stable alpha helix-dominant secondary structure, which possibly aids in withstanding the temperature fluctuations during blood-feeding events. ΔLTRIN possesses two Ca2+ binding EF-hand domains, with the second EF-hand motif playing a more significant role in interacting with LTβR. Additionally, we mapped the primary binding regions of ΔLTRIN on LTβR using hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and identified that 91QEKAHIAEHMDVPIDTSKMSEQELQFHY118 from the N-terminal of ΔLTRIN is the major interacting region. Together, our studies provide insight into the recognition of LTRIN by LTβR. This finding may aid in a future therapeutic and transmission-blocking vaccine development against ZIKV.

TI  - Regulatory Role of Host MicroRNAs in Flaviviruses Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA that affect mRNA abundance or translation efficiency by binding to the 3′UTR of the mRNA of the target gene, thereby participating in multiple biological processes, including viral infection. Flavivirus genus consists of small, positive-stranded, single-stranded RNA viruses transmitted by arthropods, especially mosquitoes and ticks. The genus contains several globally significant human/animal pathogens, such as Dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Yellow fever virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Tembusu virus. After flavivirus invades, the expression of host miRNA changes, exerting the immune escape mechanism to create an environment conducive to its survival, and the altered miRNA in turn affects the life cycle of the virus. Accumulated evidence suggests that host miRNAs influence flavivirus replication and host–virus interactions through direct binding of viral genomes or through virus-mediated host transcriptome changes. Furthermore, miRNA can also interweave with other non-coding RNAs, such as long non-coding RNA and circular RNA, to form an interaction network to regulate viral replication. A variety of non-coding RNAs produced by the virus itself exert similar function by interacting with cellular RNA and viral RNA. Understanding the interaction sites between non-coding RNA, especially miRNA, and virus/host genes will help us to find targets for antiviral drugs and viral therapy.

EP  - 10113
AB  - Abstract To date, no approved drugs are available to treat the Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Therefore, it is necessary to urgently identify potential drugs against the ZIKV infection. Here, the repurposing of 30 antiparasitic drugs against the NS2B-NS3 protease of the ZIKV has been carried out by using combined docking and molecular dynamics- (MD) simulations. Based on the docking results, 5 drugs, such as Amodiaquine, Primaquine, Paromomycin, Dichlorophene, and Ivermectin were screened for further analysis by MD simulations and free energy calculations. Among these drugs, Amodiaquine and Dichlorophen are found to produce the most stable complexes and possess relative binding free energies of about −44.3 ± 3.7 kcal/mol and −41.1 ± 5.3 kcal/mol respectively. Therefore, they would act as potent small-molecule inhibitors of the ZIKV protease.However, evaluations of biological and safety activities of these drugs against the ZIKV protease are required before their clinical use.

TI  - Repurposing of Doramectin as a New Anti-Zika Virus Agent
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), belonging to the Flavivirus family and mainly transmitted by mosquitoes, causes a variety of adverse outcomes, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, microcephaly, and meningoencephalitis. However, there are no approved vaccines or drugs available for ZIKV. The discovery and research on drugs for ZIKV are still essential. In this study, we identified doramectin, an approved veterinary antiparasitic drug, as a novel anti-ZIKV agent (EC50 value from 0.85 μM to 3.00 μM) with low cytotoxicity (CC50 > 50 μM) in multiple cellular models. The expression of ZIKV proteins also decreased significantly under the treatment of doramectin. Further study showed that doramectin directly interacted with the key enzyme for ZIKV genome replication, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), with a stronger affinity (Kd = 16.9 μM), which may be related to the effect on ZIKV replication. These results suggested that doramectin might serve as a promising drug candidate for anti-ZIKV.

JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 13
AB  - In recent years, the outbreak of infectious disease caused by Zika Virus (ZIKV) has posed a major threat to global public health, calling for the development of therapeutics to treat ZIKV disease. Several possible druggable targets involved in virus replication have been identified. In search of additional potential inhibitors, we screened 2895 FDA-approved compounds using Non-Structural Protein 5 (NS5) as a target utilizing virtual screening of in-silco methods. The top 28 compounds with the threshold of binding energy −7.2 kcal/mol value were selected and were cross-docked on the three-dimensional structure of NS5 using AutoDock Tools. Of the 2895 compounds screened, five compounds (Ceforanide, Squanavir, Amcinonide, Cefpiramide, and Olmesartan_Medoxomil) ranked highest based on filtering of having the least negative interactions with the NS5 and were selected for Molecular Dynamic Simulations (MDS) studies. Various parameters such as RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, PCA and binding free energy were calculated to validate the binding of compounds to the target, ZIKV-NS5. The binding free energy was found to be −114.53, −182.01, −168.19, −91.16, −122.56, and −150.65 kJ mol^−1 for NS5-SFG, NS5-Ceforanide, NS5-Squanavir, NS5-Amcinonide, NS5-Cefpiramide, and NS5-Ol_Me complexes respectively. The binding energy calculations suggested Cefpiramide and Olmesartan_Medoxomil (Ol_Me) as the most stable compounds for binding to NS5, indicating a strong rationale for their use as lead compounds for development of ZIKV inhibitors. As these drugs have been evaluated on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters only, in vitro and in vivo testing and their impact on Zika viral cell culture may suggest their clinical trials on ZIKV patients.

TI  - Residue K28 of Zika Virus NS5 Protein Is Implicated in Virus Replication and Antagonism of STAT2
JF  - Microorganisms
VL  - 12
AB  - The identification of four potential nonstructural 5 (NS5) residues—K28, K45, V335, and S749—that share the same amino acid preference in STAT2-interacting flaviviruses [Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV)], but not in STAT2-non-interacting flaviviruses [West Nile virus (WNV) and/or Yellow fever virus (YFV)] from an alignment of multiple flavivirus NS5 sequences, implied a possible association with the efficiency of ZIKV to antagonize the human signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 2 (STAT2). Through site-directed mutagenesis and reverse genetics, mutational impacts of these residues on ZIKV growth in vitro and STAT2 antagonism were assessed using virus growth kinetics assays and STAT2 immunoblotting. The results showed that mutations at the residue K28 significantly reduced the efficiency of ZIKV to antagonize STAT2. Further investigation involving residue K28 demonstrated its additional effects on the phenotypes of ZIKV-NS5 nuclear bodies. These findings demonstrate that K28, identified from sequence alignment, is an important determinant of replication and STAT2 antagonism by ZIKV.

TI  - Restriction of Zika virus infection and transmission in Aedes aegypti mediated by an insect-specific flavivirus
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 7
AB  - Abstract Previous studies demonstrated an insect-specific flavivirus, Nhumirim virus (NHUV), can suppress growth of West Nile virus (WNV) and decrease transmission rates in NHUV/WNV co-inoculated Culex quinquefasciatus. To assess whether NHUV might interfere with transmission of other medically important flaviviruses, the ability of NHUV to suppress viral growth of Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue-2 virus (DENV-2) was assessed in Aedes albopictus cells. Significant reductions in ZIKV (100,000-fold) and DENV-2 (10,000-fold) were observed in either cells concurrently inoculated with NHUV or pre-inoculated with NHUV. In contrast, only a transient 10-fold titer reduction was observed with an alphavirus, chikungunya virus. Additionally, restricted in vitro mosquito growth of ZIKV was associated with lowered levels of intracellular ZIKV RNA in NHUV co-inoculated cultures. To assess whether NHUV could modulate vector competence for ZIKV, NHUV-inoculated Aedes aegypti were orally exposed to ZIKV. NHUV-inoculated mosquitoes demonstrated significantly lower ZIKV infection rates (18%) compared to NHUV unexposed mosquitoes (51%) (p < 0.002). Similarly, lower ZIKV transmission rates were observed for NHUV/ZIKV dually intrathoracically inoculated mosquitoes (41%) compared to ZIKV only inoculated mosquitoes (78%) (p < 0.0001), suggesting that NHUV can interfere with both midgut infection and salivary gland infection of ZIKV in Ae. aegypti. These results indicate NHUV could be utilized to model superinfection exclusion mechanism(s) and to study the potential for the mosquito virome to impact transmission of medically important flaviviruses.

TI  - Restriction of Zika Virus Replication in Human Monocyte-Derived Macrophages by Pro-Inflammatory (M1) Polarization
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 26
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is primarily transmitted through mosquito bites, but can also spread via sexual contact and from mother to fetus. While often asymptomatic, ZIKV can lead to severe neurological conditions, including microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain–Barré Syndrome in adults. ZIKV can infect placental macrophages and fetal microglia in vivo as well as human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in vitro. Here, we observed that both human monocytes, and MDM particularly, supported ZIKV replication without evident cytopathicity, with virions accumulating in cytoplasmic vacuoles. We also investigated whether the cytokine-induced polarization of MDMs into M1 or M2 cells affected ZIKV replication. The stimulation of MDMs with pro-inflammatory cytokines (interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α) polarized MDMs into M1 cells, significantly reducing ZIKV replication, akin to previous observations with a human immunodeficiency virus type-1 infection. In contrast, M2 polarization, induced by interleukin-4, did not affect ZIKV replication in MDMs. M1 polarization selectively reduced the expression of MERTK, a TAM family putative entry receptor, and increased the expression of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) previously associated with the containment of ZIKV infection; of interest, ZIKV infection transiently boosted the expression of some ISGs in M1-MDMs. These findings suggest a dual mechanism of ZIKV restriction in M1-MDMs and highlight potential antiviral strategies targeting innate immune responses.

TI  - Revealing the characteristics of ZIKV infection through tissue-specific transcriptome sequencing analysis
JF  - BMC Genomics
VL  - 23
AB  - Background Recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) re-emerged in India and was potentially associated with microcephaly. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ZIKV pathogenesis remain to be explored. Results Herein, we performed a comprehensive RNA-sequencing analysis on ZIKV-infected JEG-3, U-251 MG, and HK-2 cells versus corresponding uninfected controls. Combined with a series of functional analyses, including gene annotation, pathway enrichment, and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, we defined the molecular characteristics induced by ZIKV infection in different tissues and invasion time points. Data showed that ZIKV infection and replication in each susceptible organ commonly stimulated interferon production and down-regulated metabolic-related processes. Also, tissue-specific immune responses or biological processes (BPs) were induced after ZIKV infection, including GnRH signaling pathway in JEG-3 cells, MAPK signaling pathway in U-251 MG cells, and PPAR signaling pathway in HK-2 cells. Of note, ZIKV infection induced delayed antiviral interferon responses in the placenta-derived cell lines, which potentially explains the molecular mechanism by which ZIKV replicates rapidly in the placenta and subsequential vertical transmission occurs. Conclusions Together, these data may provide a systemic insight into the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection in distinct human tissue-derived cell lines, which is likely to help develop prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against ZIKV infection.

TI  - Revised Annotation and Characterization of Novel Aedes albopictus miRNAs and Their Potential Functions in Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Biology
VL  - 11
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Ae. albopictus), is a highly invasive species that transmit several arboviruses including dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV). Although several studies have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) in Ae. albopictus, it is crucial to extend and improve current annotations with the newly improved genome assembly, and the increase number of small RNA-sequencing data. We combined our high-depth sequence data and 26 public datasets to re-annotate Ae. albopictus miRNAs, and found a total of 110 novel mature miRNAs. We discovered that the expression of novel miRNAs was lower than known miRNAs. Furthermore, compared to known miRNAs, novel miRNAs are prone to be expressed in stage-specific manner. Upon DENV infection, a total of 59 novel miRNAs were differentially expressed, and target prediction analysis revealed that miRNA-target genes were involved in lipid metabolism and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. Taken together, miRNA annotation profile provided here is the most comprehensive to date, and we believed that this will facilitate future research in understanding virus-host interactions particularly on the role of miRNAs.

TI  - Rewiring cellular networks by members of the Flaviviridae family
JF  - Nature Reviews. Microbiology
VL  - 16
SP  - 125
EP  - 142
AB  - Members of the Flaviviridae virus family comprise a large group of enveloped viruses with a single-strand RNA genome of positive polarity. Several genera belong to this family, including the Hepacivirus genus, of which hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the prototype member, and the Flavivirus genus, which contains both dengue virus and Zika virus. Viruses of these genera differ in many respects, such as the mode of transmission or the course of infection, which is either predominantly persistent in the case of HCV or acutely self-limiting in the case of flaviviruses. Although the fundamental replication strategy of Flaviviridae members is similar, during the past few years, important differences have been discovered, including the way in which these viruses exploit cellular resources to facilitate viral propagation. These differences might be responsible, at least in part, for the various biological properties of these viruses, thus offering the possibility to learn from comparisons. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of how Flaviviridae viruses manipulate and usurp cellular pathways in infected cells. Specifically, we focus on comparing strategies employed by flaviviruses with those employed by hepaciviruses, and we discuss the importance of these interactions in the context of viral replication and antiviral therapies.

TI  - Ribosomal stress and Tp53-mediated neuronal apoptosis in response to capsid protein of the Zika virus
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - We report here that in rat and human neuroprogenitor cells as well as rat embryonic cortical neurons Zika virus (ZIKV) infection leads to ribosomal stress that is characterized by structural disruption of the nucleolus. The anti-nucleolar effects were most pronounced in postmitotic neurons. Moreover, in the latter system, nucleolar presence of ZIKV capsid protein (ZIKV-C) was associated with ribosomal stress and apoptosis. Deletion of 22 C-terminal residues of ZIKV-C prevented nucleolar localization, ribosomal stress and apoptosis. Consistent with a casual relationship between ZIKV-C-induced ribosomal stress and apoptosis, ZIKV-C-overexpressing neurons were protected by loss-of-function manipulations targeting the ribosomal stress effector Tp53 or knockdown of the ribosomal stress mediator RPL11. Finally, capsid protein of Dengue virus, but not West Nile virus, induced ribosomal stress and apoptosis. Thus, anti-nucleolar and pro-apoptotic effects of protein C are flavivirus-species specific. In the case of ZIKV, capsid protein-mediated ribosomal stress may contribute to neuronal death, neurodevelopmental disruption and microcephaly.

TI  - RIG-I and MDA5 are modulated by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP6) and are essential for restricting Zika virus infection in human Sertoli cells
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - Sexual transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with virus persistence in the testes and shedding in the seminal fluid for months after recovery. We previously demonstrated that ZIKV can establish long-term replication without causing cytotoxicity in human Sertoli cells (SC), responsible for maintaining the immune privileged compartment of seminiferous tubules. Functional gene expression analyses also predicted activation of multiple virus sensing pathways including TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5. Here, we elucidated which of the RNA virus sensing receptors play a decisive role in restricting ZIKV replication. We show that both poly I:C and IFN-β treatment induced a robust antiviral state and reduced ZIKV replication significantly, suggesting that virus sensing and antiviral signaling are functional in SC. Silencing of TLR3, 7, and 9 did not affect virus replication kinetics; however, both RIG-I and MDA5 played a synergistic role in inducing an anti-ZIKV response. Further, the impact of SC-specific immunosuppressive pathways that collectively regulate SC function, specifically the TGF-β superfamily members, TGF-β, Activin A, and BMP6, on ZIKV replication was investigated. While ZIKV did not modulate the expression of TGF-β and Activin A, BMP6 signaling was suppressed at later stages of infection. Notably, treatment with BMP6 increased IFN-β, p-IRF3, and p-STAT1 levels, and expression of key interferon-stimulated genes including MDA5, suggesting that BMP6 enhances antiviral response in SC. Collectively, this study further delineates the key role of the RIG-I-like receptors in sensing ZIKV in SC, and reveals a novel role of BMP6 in modulating innate immune and antiviral response in the testes.

TI  - RIG-I Plays a Dominant Role in the Induction of Transcriptional Changes in Zika Virus-Infected Cells, which Protect from Virus-Induced Cell Death
JF  - Cells
VL  - 9
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) has received much attention due to an alarming increase in cases of neurological disorders including congenital Zika syndrome associated with infection. To date, there is no effective treatment available. An immediate response by the innate immune system is crucial for effective control of the virus. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockouts in A549 cells, we investigated the individual contributions of the RIG-I-like receptors MDA5 and RIG-I to ZIKV sensing and control of this virus by using a Brazilian ZIKV strain. We show that RIG-I is the main sensor for ZIKV in A549 cells. Surprisingly, we observed that loss of RIG-I and consecutive type I interferon (IFN) production led to virus-induced apoptosis. ZIKV non-structural protein NS5 was reported to interfere with type I IFN receptor signaling. Additionally, we show that ZIKV NS5 inhibits type I IFN induction. Overall, our study highlights the importance of RIG-I-dependent ZIKV sensing for the prevention of virus-induced cell death and shows that NS5 inhibits the production of type I IFN.

TI  - RIPK3 coordinates RHIM domain-dependent antiviral inflammatory transcription in neurons.
JF  - Science signaling
VL  - 18 880
SP  - eado9745
EP  - 
AB  - Neurons are postmitotic, nonregenerative cells that have evolved fine-tuned immunological responses to maintain life-long cellular integrity, including resistance to common programmed cell death pathways such as necroptosis. We previously demonstrated a necroptosis-independent role for the key necroptotic kinase RIPK3 in host defense against neurotropic flavivirus infection. Here, we show that RIPK3 activation had distinct outcomes in primary cortical neurons when compared with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) during Zika virus (ZIKV) infection or after sterile activation. We found that RIPK3 activation did not induce neuronal death but instead drove antiviral gene transcription after ZIKV infection. Although RIPK3 activation in MEFs induced cell death, ablation of downstream cell death effectors unveiled a RIPK3-dependent transcriptional program that largely overlapped with that observed in ZIKV-infected neurons. In death-resistant MEFs, RIPK3-dependent transcription relied on interactions with the RHIM domain-containing proteins RIPK1 and TRIF, similar to the requirements for the RIPK3-dependent antiviral transcriptional signature in ZIKV-infected neurons. These findings suggest that the pleotropic functions of RIPK3 are largely context dependent and that in cells that are resistant to cell death, RIPK3 acts as a mediator of inflammatory transcription.

TI  - RIPK3-Dependent Necroptosis Is Induced and Restricts Viral Replication in Human Astrocytes Infected With Zika Virus
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis are regulated processes of cell death which can be crucial for viral disease outcomes in hosts because of their effects on viral pathogenicity and host resistance. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, which infects humans and can cause neurological disorders. Neural developmental disorders and microcephaly could occur in infected fetuses. Several types of nervous cells have been reported to be susceptible to ZIKV infection. Human astrocytes play important roles in the nutritional support and defense of neurons. In this study, we show that human astrocytes are susceptible to ZIKV infection and undergo progressive cell death after infection. In infected astrocytes we detected no cleavage or activation of pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-1. Apoptotic substrates and increased secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β or IL-18 were not detected, either. These ruled out the occurrence of apoptosis or pyroptosis in ZIKV-infected astrocytes. We detected, however, an increase of phosphorylated receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIPK)1, RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein, indicating that programmed necrosis, or necroptosis, was induced in infected astrocytes. The phosphorylation and cell death were inhibited in cells pre-treated with GSK’872, an inhibitor of RIPK3, while inhibition of RIPK1 with an inhibitor, Necrostatin-1, had no effect, suggesting that ZIKV-induced necroptosis was RIPK1-independent in astrocytes. Consistent with this finding, the inhibition of RIPK1 had no effect on the phosphorylation of MLKL. We showed evidence that MLKL phosphorylation was RIPK3-dependent and ZBP-1, which could stimulate RIPK3, was upregulated in ZIKV-infected astrocytes. Finally, we demonstrated that in GSK’872-pre-treated astrocytes, viral replication increased significantly, which indicates that necroptosis may be protective against viral replication in astrocytes. Our finding that astrocytes uniquely underwent necroptosis in response to ZIKV infection provides insight and helps us better understand the viral pathogenesis in the ZIKV-infected central nervous system.

JF  - Ecology and Evolution
VL  - 7
SP  - 4475
EP  - 4485
AB  - Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito‐transmitted flavivirus, linked to microcephaly and fetal death in humans. Here, we investigate whether host‐mediated RNA editing of adenosines (ADAR) plays a role in the molecular evolution of ZIKV. Using complete coding sequences for the ZIKV polyprotein, we show that potential ADAR substitutions are underrepresented at the ADAR‐resistant GA dinucleotides of both the positive and negative strands, that these changes are spatially and temporally clustered (as expected of ADAR editing) for three branches of the viral phylogeny, and that ADAR mutagenesis can be linked to its codon usage. Furthermore, resistant GA dinucleotides are enriched on the positive (but not negative) strand, indicating that the former is under stronger purifying selection than the latter. ADAR editing also affects the evolution of the rhabdovirus sigma. Our study now documents that host ADAR editing is a mutation and evolutionary force of positive‐ as well as negative‐strand RNA viruses.

TI  - RNA Structure Duplication in the Dengue Virus 3′ UTR: Redundancy or Host Specificity?
JF  - mBio
VL  - 10
AB  - Flaviviruses constitute the most relevant group of arthropod-transmitted viruses, including important human pathogens such as the dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The natural alternation of these viruses between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts shapes the viral genome population, which leads to selection of different viral variants with potential implications for epidemiological fitness and pathogenesis. However, the selective forces and mechanisms acting on the viral RNA during host adaptation are still largely unknown. Here, we found that two almost identical tandem RNA structures present at the viral 3′ untranslated region are under different selective pressures in the two hosts. Mechanistic studies indicated that the two RNA elements, known as dumbbells, contain sequences that overlap essential RNA cyclization elements involved in viral RNA synthesis. The data support a model in which the duplicated RNA structures differentially evolved to accommodate distinct functions for viral replication in the two hosts. ABSTRACT Flaviviruses include a diverse group of medically important viruses that cycle between mosquitoes and humans. During this natural process of switching hosts, each species imposes different selective forces on the viral population. Using dengue virus (DENV) as model, we found that paralogous RNA structures originating from duplications in the viral 3′ untranslated region (UTR) are under different selective pressures in the two hosts. These RNA structures, known as dumbbells (DB1 and DB2), were originally proposed to be enhancers of viral replication. Analysis of viruses obtained from infected mosquitoes showed selection of mutations that mapped in DB2. Recombinant viruses carrying the identified variations confirmed that these mutations greatly increase viral replication in mosquito cells, with low or no impact in human cells. Use of viruses lacking each of the DB structures revealed opposite viral phenotypes. While deletion of DB1 reduced viral replication about 10-fold, viruses lacking DB2 displayed a great increase of fitness in mosquitoes, confirming a functional diversification of these similar RNA elements. Mechanistic analysis indicated that DB1 and DB2 differentially modulate viral genome cyclization and RNA replication. We found that a pseudoknot formed within DB2 competes with long-range RNA-RNA interactions that are necessary for minus-strand RNA synthesis. Our results support a model in which a functional diversification of duplicated RNA elements in the viral 3′ UTR is driven by host-specific requirements. This study provides new ideas for understanding molecular aspects of the evolution of RNA viruses that naturally jump between different species.

TI  - RNA-dependent structures of the RNA-binding loop in the flavivirus NS3 helicase
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The flavivirus NS3 protein is a helicase that has pivotal functions during the viral genome replication process, where it unwinds double-stranded RNA and translocates along the nucleic acid polymer in a nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis-dependent mechanism. An increased interest in this enzyme as a potential target for development of antiviral therapeutics was sparked by the 2015 Zika virus epidemic in the Americas. Crystallographic and computational studies of the flavivirus NS3 helicase have identified the RNA-binding loop as an interesting structural element, which may function as an origin for the RNA-enhanced NTPase activity observed for this family of helicases. Microsecond-long unbiased molecular dynamics as well as extensive replica exchange umbrella sampling simulations of the Zika NS3 helicase have been performed to investigate the RNA-dependence of this loop’s structural conformations. Specifically, the effect of the bound single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) oligomer on the putative “open” and “closed” conformations of this loop are studied. In the Apo substrate state, the two structures are nearly isoergonic (ΔGO→C = −0.22 kcal mol−1), explaining the structural ambiguity observed in Apo NS3h crystal structures. The bound ssRNA is seen to stabilize the “open” conformation (ΔGO→C = 1.97 kcal mol−1) through direct protein-RNA interactions at the top of the loop. Interestingly, a small ssRNA oligomer bound over 13 Å away from the loop is seen to affect the free energy surface to favor the “open” structure while minimizing barriers between the two states. The mechanism of the transition between “open” and “closed” states is characterized as are residues of importance for the RNA-binding loop structures. From these results, the loop is hypothesized to be a viable region in the protein for targeted small-molecule inhibition and mutagenesis studies, where stabilization of the “closed” RNA-binding loop will negatively impact RNA-binding and the RNA-enhanced NTPase activity.

TI  - RNA-Seq Reveals Transcriptome Changes Following Zika Virus Infection in Fetal Brains in c-Flip Knockdown Mice
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - The FADD-like interleukin-1β converting enzyme (FLICE)-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including apoptosis and inflammation. However, the complete transcriptional profile altered by the c-FLIP is not fully understood. Furthermore, the impact of the c-FLIP deficiency on the transcriptome during a Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, which induces apoptosis and inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we compared transcriptome profiles between wild-type (WT) and the c-Flip heterozygous knockout mice (c-Flip+/−) fetal heads at embryonic day 13.5 from control and PBS-infected WT dams mated with c-Flip+/− sires. In the non-infected group, we observed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) mainly involved in embryonic development and neuron development. However, the ZIKV infection significantly altered the transcriptional profile between WT and the c-Flip+/− fetal heads. DEGs in pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-related signaling pathways, such as the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, were enriched. Moreover, the DEGs were also enriched in T cells, indicating that the c-FLIP participates in both innate and adaptive immune responses upon viral infection. Furthermore, our observations indicate that DEGs are associated with sensory organ development and eye development, suggesting a potential role for the c-FLIP in ZIKV-induced organ development defects. Overall, we have provided a comprehensive transcriptional profile for the c-FLIP and its modulation during a ZIKV infection.

TI  - Role of autophagy during the replication and pathogenesis of common mosquito-borne flavi- and alphaviruses
JF  - Open Biology
VL  - 9
AB  - Arboviruses that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes represent one of the most important causes of febrile illness worldwide. In recent decades, we have witnessed a dramatic re-emergence of several mosquito-borne arboviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). DENV is currently the most common mosquito-borne arbovirus, with an estimated 390 million infections worldwide annually. Despite a global effort, no specific therapeutic strategies are available to combat the diseases caused by these viruses. Multiple cellular pathways modulate the outcome of infection by either promoting or hampering viral replication and/or pathogenesis, and autophagy appears to be one of them. Autophagy is a degradative pathway generally induced to counteract viral infection. Viruses, however, have evolved strategies to subvert this pathway and to hijack autophagy components for their own benefit. In this review, we will focus on the role of autophagy in mosquito-borne arboviruses with emphasis on DENV, CHIKV, WNV and ZIKV, due to their epidemiological importance and high disease burden.

TI  - Role of Capsid Anchor in the Morphogenesis of Zika Virus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 92
AB  - The capsid anchor (Ca) is a single-pass transmembrane domain at the C terminus of the capsid protein (C) known to function as a signal for the translocation of PrM into the ER lumen. The objective of this study was to further examine the role of Ca in Zika virus life cycle, whether involved in the formation of nucleocapsid through association with C or in the formation of viral envelope. In this study, we show that Ca has a function beyond the one of translocation signal, controlling protein E stability and therefore its availability for assembly of infectious particles. ABSTRACT The flavivirus capsid protein (C) is separated from the downstream premembrane (PrM) protein by a hydrophobic sequence named capsid anchor (Ca). During polyprotein processing, Ca is sequentially cleaved by the viral NS2B/NS3 protease on the cytosolic side and by signal peptidase on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To date, Ca is considered important mostly for directing translocation of PrM into the ER lumen. In this study, the role of Ca in the assembly and secretion of Zika virus was investigated using a pseudovirus-based approach. Our results show that, while Ca-mediated anchoring of C to the ER membrane is not needed for the production of infective particles, Ca expression in cis with respect to PrM is strictly required to allow proper assembly of infectious particles. Finally, we show that the presence of heterologous, but not homologous, Ca induces degradation of E through the autophagy/lysosomal pathway. IMPORTANCE The capsid anchor (Ca) is a single-pass transmembrane domain at the C terminus of the capsid protein (C) known to function as a signal for the translocation of PrM into the ER lumen.

TI  - Role of Host Cell Secretory Machinery in Zika Virus Life Cycle
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 10
AB  - The high human cost of Zika virus infections and the rapid establishment of virus circulation in novel areas, including the United States, present an urgent need for countermeasures against this emerging threat. The development of an effective vaccine against Zika virus may be problematic because of the cross reactivity of the antibodies with other flaviviruses leading to antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Moreover, rapidly replicating positive strand RNA viruses, including Zika virus, generate large spectrum of mutant genomes (quasi species) every replication round, allowing rapid selection of variants resistant to drugs targeting virus-specific proteins. On the other hand, viruses are ultimate cellular parasites and rely on the host metabolism for every step of their life cycle, thus presenting an opportunity to manipulate host processes as an alternative approach to suppress virus replication and spread. Zika and other flaviviruses critically depend on the cellular secretory pathway, which transfers proteins and membranes from the ER through the Golgi to the plasma membrane, for virion assembly, maturation and release. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of interactions of Zika and similar arthropod-borne flaviviruses with the cellular secretory machinery with a special emphasis on virus-specific changes of the secretory pathway. Identification of the regulatory networks and effector proteins required to accommodate the trafficking of virions, which represent a highly unusual cargo for the secretory pathway, may open an attractive and virtually untapped reservoir of alternative targets for the development of superior anti-viral drugs.

TI  - Role of Host-Mediated Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) in RNA Virus Pathogenesis
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 22
AB  - Being opportunistic intracellular pathogens, viruses are dependent on the host for their replication. They hijack host cellular machinery for their replication and survival by targeting crucial cellular physiological pathways, including transcription, translation, immune pathways, and apoptosis. Immediately after translation, the host and viral proteins undergo a process called post-translational modification (PTM). PTMs of proteins involves the attachment of small proteins, carbohydrates/lipids, or chemical groups to the proteins and are crucial for the proteins’ functioning. During viral infection, host proteins utilize PTMs to control the virus replication, using strategies like activating immune response pathways, inhibiting viral protein synthesis, and ultimately eliminating the virus from the host. PTM of viral proteins increases solubility, enhances antigenicity and virulence properties. However, RNA viruses are devoid of enzymes capable of introducing PTMs to their proteins. Hence, they utilize the host PTM machinery to promote their survival. Proteins from viruses belonging to the family: Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Retroviridae, and Coronaviridae such as chikungunya, dengue, zika, HIV, and coronavirus are a few that are well-known to be modified. This review discusses various host and virus-mediated PTMs that play a role in the outcome during the infection.

TI  - Role of RNA-binding proteins during the late stages of Flavivirus replication cycle
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 17
AB  - The genus Flavivirus encompasses several worldwide-distributed arthropod-borne viruses including, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, Zika virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Infection with these viruses manifest with symptoms ranging from febrile illness to life- threatening hypotensive shock and encephalitis. Therefore, flaviviruses pose a great risk to public health. Currently, preventive measures are falling short to control epidemics and there are no antivirals against any Flavivirus. Flaviviruses carry a single stranded positive-sense RNA genome that plays multiple roles in infected cells: it is translated into viral proteins, used as template for genome replication, it is the precursor of the subgenomic flaviviral RNA and it is assembled into new virions. Furthermore, viral RNA genomes are also packaged into extracellular vesicles, e.g. exosomes, which represent an alternate mode of virus dissemination. Because RNA molecules are at the center of Flavivirus replication cycle, viral and host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical determinants of infection. Numerous studies have revealed the function of RBPs during Flavivirus infection, particularly at the level of RNA translation and replication. These proteins, however, are also critical participants at the late stages of the replication cycle. Here we revise the function of host RBPs and the viral proteins capsid, NS2A and NS3, during the packaging of viral RNA and the assembly of new virus particles. Furthermore, we go through the evidence pointing towards the importance of host RBPs in mediating cellular RNA export with the idea that the biogenesis of exosomes harboring Flavivirus RNA would follow an analogous pathway.

TI  - Role of the Microbiome in Aedes spp. Vector Competence: What Do We Know?
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the vectors of important arboviruses: dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever. Female mosquitoes acquire arboviruses by feeding on the infected host blood, thus being able to transmit it to their offspring. The intrinsic ability of a vector to infect itself and transmit a pathogen is known as vector competence. Several factors influence the susceptibility of these females to be infected by these arboviruses, such as the activation of the innate immune system through the Toll, immunodeficiency (Imd), JAK-STAT pathways, and the interference of specific antiviral response pathways of RNAi. It is also believed that the presence of non-pathogenic microorganisms in the microbiota of these arthropods could influence this immune response, as it provides a baseline activation of the innate immune system, which may generate resistance against arboviruses. In addition, this microbiome has direct action against arboviruses, mainly due to the ability of Wolbachia spp. to block viral genome replication, added to the competition for resources within the mosquito organism. Despite major advances in the area, studies are still needed to evaluate the microbiota profiles of Aedes spp. and their vector competence, as well as further exploration of the individual roles of microbiome components in activating the innate immune system.

TI  - Roles of Non-Structural Protein 4A in Flavivirus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Infections with viruses in the genus Flavivirus are a worldwide public health problem. These enveloped, positive sense single stranded RNA viruses use a small complement of only 10 encoded proteins and the RNA genome itself to remodel host cells to achieve conditions favoring viral replication. A consequence of the limited viral armamentarium is that each protein exerts multiple cellular effects, in addition to any direct role in viral replication. The viruses encode four non-structural (NS) small transmembrane proteins (NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B) which collectively remain rather poorly characterized. NS4A is a 16kDa membrane associated protein and recent studies have shown that this protein plays multiple roles, including in membrane remodeling, antagonism of the host cell interferon response, and in the induction of autophagy, in addition to playing a role in viral replication. Perhaps most importantly, NS4A has been implicated as playing a critical role in fetal developmental defects seen as a consequence of Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the multiple roles of this small but pivotal protein in mediating the pathobiology of flaviviral infections.

TI  - Roles of NS1 Protein in Flavivirus Pathogenesis.
JF  - ACS infectious diseases
AB  - Flaviviruses such as dengue, Zika, and West Nile viruses are highly concerning pathogens that pose significant risks to public health. The NS1 protein is conserved among flaviviruses and is synthesized as a part of the flavivirus polyprotein. It plays a critical role in viral replication, disease progression, and immune evasion. Post-translational modifications influence NS1's stability, secretion, antigenicity, and interactions with host factors. NS1 protein forms extensive interactions with host cellular proteins allowing it to affect vital processes such as RNA processing, gene expression regulation, and cellular homeostasis, which in turn influence viral replication, disease pathogenesis, and immune responses. NS1 acts as an immune evasion factor by delaying complement-dependent lysis of infected cells and contributes to disease pathogenesis by inducing endothelial cell damage and vascular leakage and triggering autoimmune responses. Anti-NS1 antibodies have been shown to cross-react with host endothelial cells and platelets, causing autoimmune destruction that is hypothesized to contribute to disease pathogenesis. However, in contrast, immunization of animal models with the NS1 protein confers protection against lethal challenges from flaviviruses such as dengue and Zika viruses. Understanding the multifaceted roles of NS1 in flavivirus pathogenesis is crucial for effective disease management and control. Therefore, further research into NS1 biology, including its host protein interactions and additional roles in disease pathology, is imperative for the development of strategies and therapeutics to combat flavivirus infections successfully. This Review provides an in-depth exploration of the current available knowledge on the multifaceted roles of the NS1 protein in the pathogenesis of flaviviruses.

TI  - Route of Zika virus infection in Aedes aegypti by transmission electron microscopy
JF  - BMC Microbiology
VL  - 21
AB  - Zika fever has been a global health security threat, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions where most of the cases occur. The disease is caused by Zika virus (ZIKV), which belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. The virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, mostly by Aedes aegypti, during its blood meal. In this study we present a descriptive analysis, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), of ZIKV infection in A. aegypti elected tissues at the 3rd day of infection. ZIKV vertical transmission experiments by oral infection were conducted to explore an offspring of natural infection. Gut and ovary tissues harbored a higher number of viral particles. The ZIKV genome was also detected, by RT-qPCR technique, in the organism of orally infected female mosquitoes and in their eggs laid. The data obtained suggest that the ovary is an organ susceptible to be infected with ZIKV and that virus can be transmitted from mother to a fraction of the progeny.

TI  - Salivary extracellular vesicles inhibit Zika virus but not SARS-CoV-2 infection
JF  - Journal of Extracellular Vesicles
VL  - 9
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is mainly transmitted via mosquitos, but human-to-human transmissions also occur. The virus is shed into various body fluids including saliva, which represents a possible source of viral transmission. Thus, we here explored whether human saliva affects ZIKV infectivity. We found that physiological concentrations of pooled saliva dose-dependently inhibit ZIKV infection of monkey and human cells by preventing viral attachment to target cells. The anti-ZIKV activity in saliva could not be abrogated by boiling, suggesting the antiviral factor is not a protein. Instead, we found that purified extracellular vesicles (EVs) from saliva inhibit ZIKV infection. Salivary EVs (saEVs) express typical EV markers such as tetraspanins CD9, CD63 and CD81 and prevent ZIKV attachment to and infection of target cells at concentrations that are naturally present in saliva. The anti-ZIKV activity of saliva is conserved but the magnitude of inhibition varies between individual donors. In contrast to ZIKV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), predominantly spreading via respiratory droplets, is not affected by saliva or saEVs. Our findings provide a plausible explanation for why ZIKV transmission via saliva, i.e. by deep kissing have not been recorded and establish a novel oral innate immune defence mechanism against some viral pathogens.

TI  - SAMHD1 Enhances Chikungunya and Zika Virus Replication in Human Skin Fibroblasts
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 20
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are emerging arboviruses that pose a worldwide threat to human health. Currently, neither vaccine nor antiviral treatment to control their infections is available. As the skin is a major viral entry site for arboviruses in the human host, we determined the global proteomic profile of CHIKV and ZIKV infections in human skin fibroblasts using Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC)-based mass-spectrometry analysis. We show that the expression of the interferon-stimulated proteins MX1, IFIT1, IFIT3 and ISG15, as well as expression of defense response proteins DDX58, STAT1, OAS3, EIF2AK2 and SAMHD1 was significantly up-regulated in these cells upon infection with either virus. Exogenous expression of IFITs proteins markedly inhibited CHIKV and ZIKV replication which, accordingly, was restored following the abrogation of IFIT1 or IFIT3. Overexpression of SAMHD1 in cutaneous cells, or pretreatment of cells with the virus-like particles containing SAMHD1 restriction factor Vpx, resulted in a strong increase or inhibition, respectively, of both CHIKV and ZIKV replication. Moreover, silencing of SAMHD1 by specific SAMHD1-siRNA resulted in a marked decrease of viral RNA levels. Together, these results suggest that IFITs are involved in the restriction of replication of CHIKV and ZIKV and provide, as yet unreported, evidence for a proviral role of SAMHD1 in arbovirus infection of human skin cells.

TI  - Schlafen 11 Restricts Flavivirus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - We provide evidence that the cellular protein Schlafen 11 (Slfn11) impairs replication of flaviviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). However, replication of single-stranded negative RNA viruses was not affected. Specifically, Slfn11 decreases the infectivity of WNV potentially by preventing virus-induced modifications of the host tRNA repertoire that could lead to enhanced viral protein folding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Slfn11 is not the limiting factor of this novel broad antiviral pathway. ABSTRACT Schlafen 11 (Slfn11) is an interferon-stimulated gene that controls the synthesis of proteins by regulating tRNA abundance. Likely through this mechanism, Slfn11 has previously been shown to impair human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the expression of codon-biased open reading frames. Because replication of positive-sense single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA] viruses requires the immediate translation of the incoming viral genome, whereas negative-sense single-stranded RNA [(−)ssRNA] viruses carry at infection an RNA replicase that makes multiple translation-competent copies of the incoming viral genome, we reasoned that (+)ssRNA viruses will be more sensitive to the effect of Slfn11 on protein synthesis than (−)ssRNA viruses. To evaluate this hypothesis, we tested the effects of Slfn11 on the replication of a panel of ssRNA viruses in the human glioblastoma cell line A172, which naturally expresses Slfn11. Depletion of Slfn11 significantly increased the replication of (+)ssRNA viruses from the Flavivirus genus, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), but had no significant effect on the replication of the (−)ssRNA viruses vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Rhabdoviridae family) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (Phenuiviridae family). Quantification of the ratio of genome-containing viral particles to PFU indicated that Slfn11 impairs WNV infectivity. Intriguingly, Slfn11 prevented WNV-induced downregulation of a subset of tRNAs implicated in the translation of 11.8% of the viral polyprotein. Low-abundance tRNAs might promote optimal protein folding and enhance viral infectivity, as previously reported. In summary, this study demonstrates that Slfn11 restricts flavivirus replication by impairing viral infectivity. IMPORTANCE We provide evidence that the cellular protein Schlafen 11 (Slfn11) impairs replication of flaviviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). However, replication of single-stranded negative RNA viruses was not affected. Specifically, Slfn11 decreases the infectivity of WNV potentially by preventing virus-induced modifications of the host tRNA repertoire that could lead to enhanced viral protein folding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Slfn11 is not the limiting factor of this novel broad antiviral pathway.

TI  - Selective Disruption of the Blood–Brain Barrier by Zika Virus
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - The blood–brain barrier (BBB) selectively regulates the cellular exchange of macromolecules between the circulation and the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we hypothesize that Zika virus (ZIKV) infects the brain via a disrupted BBB and altered expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, which are structural components of the BBB. To assess this hypothesis, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed using three different strains of ZIKV: Honduras (ZIKV-H), Puerto Rico (ZIKV-PR), and Uganda (ZIKV-U). Primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were productively infected by all studied ZIKV strains at MOI 0.01, and were analyzed by plaque assay, immunofluorescence for NS1 protein, and qRT-PCR at 2 and 6 days post-infection (dpi). Compared to mock-infected controls, expression level of ZO-1 was significantly upregulated in ZIKV-H-infected BMECs, while occludin and claudin-5 levels were significantly downregulated in BMECs infected by all three studied viral strains. Interestingly, BMEC permeability was not disturbed by ZIKV infection, even in the presence of a very high viral load (MOI 10). All studied ZIKV strains productively infected wild-type C57BL/J mice after intravenous infection with 107 PFU. Viral load was detected in the plasma, spleen, and brain from 1 to 8 dpi. Peak brain infection was observed at 2 dpi; therefore, TJ protein expression was assessed at this time point. Claudin-5 was significantly downregulated in ZIKV-U-infected animals and the BBB integrity was significantly disturbed in ZIKV-H-infected animals. Our results suggest that ZIKV penetrates the brain parenchyma early after infection with concurrent alterations of TJ protein expression and disruption of the BBB permeability in a strain-dependent manner.

TI  - Self-association features of NS1 proteins from different flaviviruses
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Flaviviruses comprise a large group of arboviral species that are distributed in several countries of the tropics, neotropics, and some temperate zones. Since they can produce neurological pathologies or vascular damage, there has been intense research seeking better diagnosis and treatments for their infections in the last decades. The flavivirus NS1 protein is a relevant clinical target because it is involved in viral replication, immune evasion, and virulence. Being a key factor in endothelial and tissue-specific modulation, NS1 has been largely studied to understand the molecular mechanisms exploited by the virus to reprogram host cells. A central part of the viral maturation processes is the NS1 oligomerization because many stages rely on these protein-protein assemblies. In the present study, the self-associations of NS1 proteins from Zika, Dengue, and West Nile viruses are examined through constant-pH coarse-grained biophysical simulations. Free energies of interactions were estimated for different oligomeric states and pH conditions. Our results show that these proteins can form both dimers and tetramers under conditions near physiological pH even without the presence of lipids. Moreover, pH plays an important role mainly controlling the regimes where van der Waals interactions govern their association. Finally, despite the similarity at the sequence level, we found that each flavivirus has a well-characteristic protein-protein interaction profile. These specific features can provide new hints for the development of binders both for better diagnostic tools and the formulation of new therapeutic drugs.

TI  - SERTAD3 induces proteasomal degradation of ZIKV capsid protein and represents a therapeutic target
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito‐borne RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. While flavivirus replication is known to occur in the cytoplasm, a significant portion of the viral capsid protein localizes to the nucleus during infection. However, the role of the nuclear capsid is less clear. Herein, we demonstrated SERTA domain containing 3 (SERTAD3) as an antiviral interferon stimulatory gene product had an antiviral ability to ZIKV but not JEV. Mechanistically, we found that SERTAD3 interacted with the capsid protein of ZIKV in the nucleolus and reduced capsid protein abundance through proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, an eight amino acid peptide of SERTAD3 was identified as the minimum motif that binds with ZIKV capsid protein. Remarkably, the eight amino acids synthetic peptide from SERTAD3 significantly prevented ZIKV infection in culture and pregnant mouse models. Taken together, these findings not only reveal the function of SERTAD3 in promoting proteasomal degradation of a specific viral protein but also provide a promising host‐targeted therapeutic strategy against ZIKV infection.

TI  - Sertoli Cells Are Susceptible to ZIKV Infection in Mouse Testis
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 7
AB  - Flaviviruses including Dengue virus (DENV), Yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are global health problems that caused several serious diseases such as fever, hemorrhagic fever, and encephalitis in the past century. Recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) which spreads from Asia to American and causes millions of infections emerges as a new dangerous member of the genus of Flavivirus. Unlike other well-known flaviviruses, ZIKV can be transmitted sexually and infect testes in murine models. Its impacts on sperm functions, and the exact susceptible cells, however, are not entirely clear. To investigate these issues, we infected interferon α/β and γ receptors deficient AG6 mice with ZIKV and examined the outcomes of infection using an assortment of physiological, histopathological, immunological, and virological techniques. We found that infected mice displayed signs of reproductive system disorder, altered androgen levels in serum, and high viral load in semen and testes. Additionally, histopathological examinations revealed marked atrophy of seminiferous tubules and significant reduction in lumen size. Notably, these were accompanied by positive staining of ZIKV antigens on sertoli cells, detection of viral particles and vacuole changes within cytoplasm of sertoli cells. The susceptibility of sertoli cells to ZIKV was further validated in vitro study using cell lines. Importantly, the disruption of tight junctions within testis and altered sperm morphology were also observed in ZIKV infected mice. It is well-known that tight junctions formed by adjacent sertoli cells are major component of blood testis barrier, which plays important roles in maintenance of microenvironment for spermagenesis in testis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that sertoli cells are susceptible to ZIKV infection, which results in the disruption of tight junctions in testis and causes abnormal spermatogenesis in mice. These results also imply that long-term impact of ZIKV infection on human male reproductive system requires close monitoring.

TI  - Shiftless inhibits flavivirus replication in vitro and is neuroprotective in a mouse model of Zika virus pathogenesis
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 118
AB  - Significance Flaviviruses are significant human pathogens and emerging infectious disease threats. A screen of interferon-inducible genes revealed Shiftless (SHFL) as a potent antiviral effector, inhibiting all Flaviviridae tested, including West Nile, Zika, dengue, yellow fever, and hepatitis C viruses. Mechanistic studies showed that SHFL inhibits viral replication at a point after translation of the incoming genome. In whole-body Shfl knockout (KO) mice, compared to wild-type mice, the Shfl KO mice were more susceptible to Zika virus. Notably, Shfl was uniquely required for controlling replication in the brain and spinal cord, demonstrating an unappreciated neuroprotective role for this effector in vivo. SHFL is a key antiviral effector that specifically inhibits flavivirus genome replication, and Shfl protects mice from Zika virus–induced neuropathogenesis. Flaviviruses such as Zika virus and West Nile virus have the potential to cause severe neuropathology if they invade the central nervous system. The type I interferon response is well characterized as contributing to control of flavivirus-induced neuropathogenesis. However, the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) effectors that confer these neuroprotective effects are less well studied. Here, we used an ISG expression screen to identify Shiftless (SHFL, C19orf66) as a potent inhibitor of diverse positive-stranded RNA viruses, including multiple members of the Flaviviridae (Zika, West Nile, dengue, yellow fever, and hepatitis C viruses). In cultured cells, SHFL functions as a viral RNA-binding protein that inhibits viral replication at a step after primary translation of the incoming genome. The murine ortholog, Shfl, is expressed constitutively in multiple tissues, including the central nervous system. In a mouse model of Zika virus infection, Shfl−/− knockout mice exhibit reduced survival, exacerbated neuropathological outcomes, and increased viral replication in the brain and spinal cord. These studies demonstrate that Shfl is an important antiviral effector that contributes to host protection from Zika virus infection and virus-induced neuropathological disease.

TI  - Signal-regulatory protein alpha is an anti-viral entry factor targeting viruses using endocytic pathways
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 17
AB  - Signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA) is a well-known inhibitor of phagocytosis when it complexes with CD47 expressed on target cells. Here we show that SIRPA decreased in vitro infection by a number of pathogenic viruses, including New World and Old World arenaviruses, Zika virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and pseudoviruses bearing the Machupo virus, Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2 glycoproteins, but not HSV-1, MLV or mNoV. Moreover, mice with targeted mutation of the Sirpa gene that renders it non-functional were more susceptible to infection with the New World arenaviruses Junín virus vaccine strain Candid 1 and Tacaribe virus, but not MLV or mNoV. All SIRPA-inhibited viruses have in common the requirement for trafficking to a low pH endosomal compartment. This was clearly demonstrated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, which was only inhibited by SIRPA in cells in which it required trafficking to the endosome. Similar to its role in phagocytosis inhibition, SIRPA decreased virus internalization but not binding to cell surface receptors. We also found that increasing SIRPA levels via treatment with IL-4 led to even greater anti-viral activity. These data suggest that enhancing SIRPA’s activity could be a target for anti-viral therapies.

TI  - Sirtuin Inhibitors Are Broadly Antiviral against Arboviruses
JF  - mBio
VL  - 10
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses are diverse pathogens and are associated with human disease. Through high-throughput drug screening, we found that sirtuin inhibitors are potently antiviral against diverse arboviruses, including flaviviruses such as West Nile virus, bunyaviruses such as Rift Valley fever virus, and alphaviruses such as chikungunya virus. Sirtuin inhibitors block infection of these viruses in multiple human cell types. Moreover, we found that sirtuin inhibitors arrest infection downstream of entry but that they do so at an early step, preventing the accumulation of viral RNA and protein. Since these viruses infect vector insects, we also tested whether sirtuin inhibitors impacted infection of adult flies and found that these inhibitors blocked infection; therefore, they target highly conserved facets of replication. Taken together, these results suggest that sirtuin inhibitors represent a new class of potent host-targeting antivirals. ABSTRACT Arthropod-borne viruses are diverse pathogens and are often associated with human disease. These viruses span multiple genera, including flaviviruses, alphaviruses, and bunyaviruses. In a high-throughput drug screen, we found that tenovin-1 was antiviral against the flaviviruses Zika virus and dengue virus. Tenovin-1 is a sirtuin inhibitor, and here we found that inhibition of sirtuins, but not inhibition of the related histone deacetylases, is potently antiviral against diverse arboviruses. Sirtuin inhibitors block infection of arboviruses in multiple human cell types. We found that sirtuin inhibitors arrest infection downstream of entry but that they do so at an early step, preventing the accumulation of viral RNA and protein. However, sirtuin inhibitors had no impact on the replication of flaviviral replicons, suggesting a defect in the establishment of replication. Consistent with this, we found that sirtuin inhibitors impacted double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) accumulation during flaviviral infection. Since these viruses infect vector insects, we also tested whether sirtuin inhibitors impacted infection of adult flies and found that these inhibitors blocked infection; therefore, they target highly conserved facets of replication. Taken together, these results suggest that sirtuin inhibitors represent a new class of potent host-targeting antivirals.

TI  - Site-specific N-glycosylation analysis of animal cell culture-derived Zika virus proteins
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 11
AB  - Here, we present for the first time, a site-specific N-glycosylation analysis of proteins from a Brazilian Zika virus (ZIKV) strain. The virus was propagated with high yield in an embryo-derived stem cell line (EB66, Valneva SE), and concentrated by g-force step-gradient centrifugation. Subsequently, the sample was proteolytically digested with different enzymes, measured via a LC–MS/MS-based workflow, and analyzed in a semi-automated way using the in-house developed glyXtoolMS software. The viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) was glycosylated exclusively with high-mannose structures on both potential N-glycosylation sites. In case of the viral envelope (E) protein, no specific N-glycans could be identified with this method. Nevertheless, N-glycosylation could be proved by enzymatic de-N-glycosylation with PNGase F, resulting in a strong MS-signal of the former glycopeptide with deamidated asparagine at the potential N-glycosylation site N444. This confirmed that this site of the ZIKV E protein is highly N-glycosylated but with very high micro-heterogeneity. Our study clearly demonstrates the progress made towards site-specific N-glycosylation analysis of viral proteins, i.e. for Brazilian ZIKV. It allows to better characterize viral isolates, and to monitor glycosylation of major antigens. The method established can be applied for detailed studies regarding the impact of protein glycosylation on antigenicity and human pathogenicity of many viruses including influenza virus, HIV and corona virus.

TI  - Skeletal Muscle Is an Early Site of Zika Virus Replication and Injury, Which Impairs Myogenesis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Zika Virus (ZIKV) neurotropism and its deleterious effects on central nervous system have been well characterized. However, investigations of the initial replication sites for the establishment of infection and viral spread to neural tissues remain underexplored. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) infection became a worldwide concern due to its correlation with the development of microcephaly and other neurological disorders. ZIKV neurotropism is well characterized, but the role of peripheral viral amplification to brain infection remains unknown. Here, we found that ZIKV replicates in human primary skeletal muscle myoblasts, impairing its differentiation into myotubes but not interfering with the integrity of the already-formed muscle fibers. Using mouse models, we showed ZIKV tropism to muscle tissue either during embryogenesis after maternal transmission or when infection occurred after birth. Interestingly, ZIKV replication in the mouse skeletal muscle started immediately after ZIKV inoculation, preceding viral RNA detection in the brain and causing no disruption to the integrity of the blood brain barrier, and remained active for more than 2 weeks, whereas replication in the spleen and liver were not sustained over time. In addition, ZIKV infection of the skeletal muscle induces necrotic lesions, inflammation, and fiber atrophy. We also found a reduction in the expression of regulatory myogenic factors that are essential for muscle repair after injury. Taken together, our results indicate that the skeletal muscle is an early site of viral amplification and lesion that may result in late consequences in muscle development after ZIKV infection. IMPORTANCE Zika Virus (ZIKV) neurotropism and its deleterious effects on central nervous system have been well characterized. However, investigations of the initial replication sites for the establishment of infection and viral spread to neural tissues remain underexplored. A complete description of the range of ZIKV-induced lesions and others factors that can influence the severity of the disease is necessary to prevent ZIKV’s deleterious effects. ZIKV has been shown to access the central nervous system without significantly affecting blood-brain barrier permeability. Here, we demonstrated that skeletal muscle is an earlier site of ZIKV replication, contributing to the increase of peripheral ZIKV load. ZIKV replication in muscle promotes necrotic lesions and inflammation and also impairs myogenesis. Overall, our findings showed that skeletal muscle is involved in pathogenesis and opens new fields in the investigation of the long-term consequences of early infection.

TI  - Small-molecule endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis regulator acts as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of dengue and Zika virus infections
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 118
AB  - Significance Viral infections continue to pose a grave global health threat, necessitating the development of new broadly applicable therapeutic strategies, including the targeting of conserved host processes that are exploited during viral infections. Flaviviruses, such as dengue and Zika, depend on extensive engagement of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis network to aid with replication, production, and secretion of virions. Here, we identify a host-centered antiviral approach by targeting these conserved ER protein quality-control processes that are required for viral infection. We find that the small-molecule regulator of ER proteostasis 147 can broadly and safely inhibit dengue and Zika infection without inducing toxicity to the host cells. Flaviviruses, including dengue and Zika, are widespread human pathogens; however, no broadly active therapeutics exist to fight infection. Recently, remodeling of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis by pharmacologic regulators, such as compound 147, was shown to correct pathologic ER imbalances associated with protein misfolding diseases. Here, we establish an additional activity of compound 147 as an effective host-centered antiviral agent against flaviviruses. Compound 147 reduces infection by attenuating the infectivity of secreted virions without causing toxicity in host cells. Compound 147 is a preferential activator of the ATF6 pathway of the ER unfolded protein response, which requires targeting of cysteine residues primarily on protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). We find that the antiviral activity of 147 is independent of ATF6 induction but does require modification of reactive thiols on protein targets. Targeting PDIs and additional non-PDI targets using RNAi and other small-molecule inhibitors was unable to recapitulate the antiviral effects, suggesting a unique polypharmacology may mediate the activity. Importantly, 147 can impair infection of multiple strains of dengue and Zika virus, indicating that it is suitable as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent.

TI  - Small-Molecule Inhibitor of Flaviviral NS3-NS5 Interaction with Broad-Spectrum Activity and Efficacy In Vivo
JF  - mBio
VL  - 14
AB  - More than one-third of the human population is at risk of infection by different mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Despite this, no specific antiviral drug is currently available. ABSTRACT Every year, dengue virus (DENV) causes one hundred million infections worldwide that can result in dengue disease and severe dengue. Two other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, i.e., Zika virus (ZIKV) and West Nile virus (WNV), are responsible of prolonged outbreaks and are associated with severe neurological diseases, congenital defects, and eventually death. These three viruses, despite their importance for global public health, still lack specific drug treatments. Here, we describe the structure-guided discovery of small molecules with pan-flavivirus antiviral potential by a virtual screening of ~1 million structures targeting the NS3-NS5 interaction surface of different flaviviruses. Two molecules inhibited the interaction between DENV NS3 and NS5 in vitro and the replication of all DENV serotypes as well as ZIKV and WNV and exhibited low propensity to select resistant viruses. Remarkably, one molecule demonstrated efficacy in a mouse model of dengue by reducing peak viremia, viral load in target organs, and associated tissue pathology. This study provides the proof of concept that targeting the flaviviral NS3-NS5 interaction is an effective therapeutic strategy able to reduce virus replication in vivo and discloses new chemical scaffolds that could be further developed, thus providing a significant milestone in the development of much awaited broad-spectrum antiflaviviral drugs. IMPORTANCE More than one-third of the human population is at risk of infection by different mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Despite this, no specific antiviral drug is currently available. In this work, using a computational approach based on molecular dynamics simulation and virtual screening of ~1 million small-molecule structures, we identified a compound that targets the interaction between the two sole flaviviral enzymes, i.e., NS3 and NS5. This compound demonstrated pan-serotype anti-DENV activity and pan-flavivirus potential in infected cells, low propensity to select viral resistant mutant viruses, and efficacy in a mouse model of dengue. Broad-spectrum antivirals are much awaited, and this work represents a significant advance toward the development of therapeutic molecules with extended antiflavivirus potential that act by an innovative mechanism and could be used alone or in combination with other antivirals.

TI  - Sofosbuvir protects Zika virus-infected mice from mortality, preventing short- and long-term sequelae
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) causes significant public health concerns because of its association with congenital malformations, neurological disorders in adults, and, more recently, death. Considering the necessity to mitigate ZIKV-associated diseases, antiviral interventions are an urgent necessity. Sofosbuvir, a drug in clinical use against hepatitis C virus (HCV), is among the FDA-approved substances endowed with anti-ZIKV activity. In this work, we further investigated the in vivo activity of sofosbuvir against ZIKV. Neonatal Swiss mice were infected with ZIKV (2 × 107 PFU) and treated with sofosbuvir at 20 mg/kg/day, a concentration compatible with pre-clinical development of this drug. We found that sofosbuvir reduced acute levels of ZIKV from 60 to 90% in different anatomical compartments, such as the blood plasma, spleen, kidney, and brain. Early treatment with sofosbuvir doubled the percentage and time of survival of ZIKV-infected animals. Sofosbuvir also prevented the acute neuromotor impairment triggered by ZIKV. In the long-term behavioural analysis of ZIKV-associated sequelae, sofosbuvir prevented loss of hippocampal- and amygdala-dependent memory. Our results indicate that sofosbuvir inhibits ZIKV replication in vivo, which is consistent with the prospective necessity of antiviral drugs to treat ZIKV-infected individuals.

TI  - Species-specific disruption of STING-dependent antiviral cellular defenses by the Zika virus NS2B3 protease
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 115
SP  - E6310
EP  - E6318
AB  - Significance To shed light on the host range of Zika virus (ZIKV), we surveyed the virus’ ability to infect cells of evolutionarily diverse species. ZIKV replicates efficiently in human, great ape, Old and New World monkey, but not rodent cells. These observations correlated with ZIKV’s ability to blunt the cGAS/STING signaling pathway in all primate cells tested but not in mice. We demonstrate that an enzyme shared by many flaviviruses (NS2B3) is responsible for functionally inactivating this antiviral defense. Our results highlight the importance of the cGAS/STING pathway in shaping the host range of ZIKV, which in turn may guide the development of murine models with inheritable susceptibility to ZIKV and other flaviviruses. The limited host tropism of numerous viruses causing disease in humans remains incompletely understood. One example is Zika virus (ZIKV), an RNA virus that has reemerged in recent years. Here, we demonstrate that ZIKV efficiently infects fibroblasts from humans, great apes, New and Old World monkeys, but not rodents. ZIKV infection in human—but not murine—cells impairs responses to agonists of the cGMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of IFN genes (cGAS/STING) signaling pathway, suggesting that viral mechanisms to evade antiviral defenses are less effective in rodent cells. Indeed, human, but not mouse, STING is subject to cleavage by proteases encoded by ZIKV, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus, but not that of yellow fever virus. The protease cleavage site, located between positions 78/79 of human STING, is only partially conserved in nonhuman primates and rodents, rendering these orthologs resistant to degradation. Genetic disruption of STING increases the susceptibility of mouse—but not human—cells to ZIKV. Accordingly, expression of only mouse, not human, STING in murine STING knockout cells rescues the ZIKV suppression phenotype. STING-deficient mice, however, did not exhibit increased susceptibility, suggesting that other redundant antiviral pathways control ZIKV infection in vivo. Collectively, our data demonstrate that numerous RNA viruses evade cGAS/STING-dependent signaling and affirm the importance of this pathway in shaping the host range of ZIKV. Furthermore, our results explain—at least in part—the decreased permissivity of rodent cells to ZIKV, which could aid in the development of mice model with inheritable susceptibility to ZIKV and other flaviviruses.

TI  - SREBP2-dependent lipid gene transcription enhances the infection of human dendritic cells by Zika virus
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 13
SP  - 1
EP  - 15
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection suppresses the induction of dendritic cell (DC)-derived immunity, but the underlying mechanistical insights are still lacking. Here the authors show, using in vitro systems profiling of DC transcriptome and epigenome, that ZIKV specifically alters SREBP2-related expression of inflammation- and metabolism-related genes to modulate DC functions. The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) as a global health threat has highlighted the unmet need for ZIKV-specific vaccines and antiviral treatments. ZIKV infects dendritic cells (DC), which have pivotal functions in activating innate and adaptive antiviral responses; however, the mechanisms by which DC function is subverted to establish ZIKV infection are unclear. Here we develop a genomics profiling method that enables discrete analysis of ZIKV-infected versus neighboring, uninfected primary human DCs to increase the sensitivity and specificity with which ZIKV-modulated pathways can be identified. The results show that ZIKV infection specifically increases the expression of genes enriched for lipid metabolism-related functions. ZIKV infection also increases the recruitment of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors to lipid gene promoters, while pharmacologic inhibition or genetic silencing of SREBP2 suppresses ZIKV infection of DCs. Our data thus identify SREBP2-activated transcription as a mechanism for promoting ZIKV infection amenable to therapeutic targeting.

TI  - Starvation at the larval stage increases the vector competence of Aedes aegypti females for Zika virus
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 15
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus which typically presents itself as febrile-like symptoms in humans but can also cause neurological and pregnancy complications. The transmission cycle of mosquito-borne arboviruses such as ZIKV requires that various key tissues in the female mosquito get productively infected with the virus before the mosquito can transmit the virus to another vertebrate host. Following ingestion of a viremic blood-meal from a vertebrate, ZIKV initially infects the midgut epithelium before exiting the midgut after blood-meal digestion to disseminate to secondary tissues including the salivary glands. Here we investigated whether smaller Ae. aegypti females resulting from food deprivation as larvae exhibited an altered vector competence for blood-meal acquired ZIKV relative to larger mosquitoes. Midguts from small ‘Starve’ and large ‘Control’ Ae. aegypti were dissected to visualize by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) the midgut basal lamina (BL) as physical evidence for the midgut escape barrier showing Starve mosquitoes with a significantly thinner midgut BL than Control mosquitoes at two timepoints. ZIKV replication was inhibited in Starve mosquitoes following intrathoracic injection of virus, however, Starve mosquitoes exhibited a significantly higher midgut escape and population dissemination rate at 9 days post-infection (dpi) via blood-meal, with more virus present in saliva and head tissue than Control by 10 dpi and 14 dpi, respectively. These results indicate that Ae. aegypti developing under stressful conditions potentially exhibit higher midgut infection and dissemination rates for ZIKV as adults, Thus, variation in food intake as larvae is potentially a source for variable vector competence levels of the emerged adults for the virus.

TI  - STAT2-Dependent Immune Responses Ensure Host Survival despite the Presence of a Potent Viral Antagonist
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 92
AB  - ABSTRACT A pathogen encounter induces interferons, which signal via Janus kinases and STAT transcription factors to establish an antiviral state. However, the host and pathogens are situated in a continuous arms race which shapes host evolution toward optimized immune responses and the pathogens toward enhanced immune-evasive properties. Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) counteracts interferon responses by pM27-mediated degradation of STAT2, which directly affects the signaling of type I as well as type III interferons. Using MCMV mutants lacking M27 and mice lacking STAT2, we studied the opposing relationship between antiviral activities and viral antagonism in a natural host-pathogen pair in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to wild-type (wt) MCMV, ΔM27 mutant MCMV was efficiently cleared from all organs within a few days in BALB/c, C57BL/6, and 129 mice, highlighting the general importance of STAT2 antagonism for MCMV replication. Despite this effective and relevant STAT2 antagonism, wt and STAT2-deficient mice exhibited fundamentally different susceptibilities to MCMV infections. MCMV replication was increased in all assessed organs (e.g., liver, spleen, lungs, and salivary glands) of STAT2-deficient mice, resulting in mortality during the first week after infection. Taken together, the results of our study reveal the importance of cytomegaloviral interferon antagonism for viral replication as well as a pivotal role of the remaining STAT2 activity for host survival. This mutual influence establishes a stable evolutionary standoff situation with fatal consequences when the equilibrium is disturbed. IMPORTANCE The host limits viral replication by the use of interferons (IFNs), which signal via STAT proteins. Several viruses evolved antagonists targeting STATs to antagonize IFNs (e.g., cytomegaloviruses, Zika virus, dengue virus, and several paramyxoviruses). We analyzed infections caused by MCMV expressing or lacking the STAT2 antagonist pM27 in STAT2-deficient and control mice to evaluate its importance for the host and the virus in vitro and in vivo. The inability to counteract STAT2 directly translates into exaggerated IFN susceptibility in vitro and pronounced attenuation in vivo. Thus, the antiviral activity mediated by IFNs via STAT2-dependent signaling drove the development of a potent MCMV-encoded STAT2 antagonist which became indispensable for efficient virus replication and spread to organs required for dissemination. Despite this clear impact of viral STAT2 antagonism, the host critically required the remaining STAT2 activity to prevent overt disease and mortality upon MCMV infection. Our findings highlight a remarkably delicate balance between host and virus.

TI  - STAT2-dependent restriction of Zika virus by human macrophages but not dendritic cells
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 10
SP  - 1024
EP  - 1037
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses significant threats to global public health. Macrophages and dendritic cells are both key sentinel cells in the host immune response and play critical roles in the pathogenesis of flavivirus infections. Recent studies showed that ZIKV could productively infect monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs), but the role of macrophages in ZIKV infection remains incompletely understood. In this study, we first compared ZIKV infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and moDCs derived from the same donors. We demonstrated that while both MDMs and moDCs were susceptible to epidemic (Puerto Rico) and pre-epidemic (Uganda) strains of ZIKV, virus replication was largely restricted in MDMs but not in moDCs. ZIKV induced significant apoptosis in moDCs but not MDMs. The restricted virus replication in MDMs was not due to inefficient virus entry but was related to post-entry events in the viral replication cycle. In stark contrast with moDCs, ZIKV failed to inhibit STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation in MDMs. This resulted in the lack of efficient antagonism of the host type I interferon-mediated antiviral responses. Importantly, depletion of STAT2 but not STAT1 in MDMs significantly rescued the replication of ZIKV and the prototype flavivirus yellow fever virus. Overall, our findings revealed a differential interplay between macrophages and dendritic cells with ZIKV. While dendritic cells may be exploited by ZIKV to facilitate virus replication, macrophages restricted ZIKV infection.

TI  - STAT5: a Target of Antagonism by Neurotropic Flaviviruses
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - Flaviviruses are a diverse group of insect-borne viruses responsible for numerous significant public health threats. Previously, we used a computational biology approach to define molecular signatures of antiviral DC responses following activation of innate immune signaling or infection with West Nile virus (WNV). In this work, we identify STAT5 as a regulator of DC activation and antiviral immune responses downstream of innate immune signaling that was not activated during either WNV or Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. WNV and ZIKV actively blocked STAT5 phosphorylation downstream of RIG-I, IFN-β, and IL-4, but not GM-CSF, signaling. However, other related flaviviruses, dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 and the yellow fever 17D vaccine strain, did not antagonize STAT5 phosphorylation. Mechanistically, WNV and ZIKV showed differential inhibition of Jak kinases upstream of STAT5, suggesting divergent countermeasures to inhibit STAT5 activation. Combined, these findings identify STAT5 as a target of antagonism by specific pathogenic flaviviruses to subvert antiviral immune responses in human DCs. ABSTRACT Flaviviruses are a diverse group of arthropod-borne viruses responsible for numerous significant public health threats; therefore, understanding the interactions between these viruses and the human immune response remains vital. West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infect human dendritic cells (DCs) and can block antiviral immune responses in DCs. Previously, we used mRNA sequencing and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to define molecular signatures of antiviral DC responses following activation of innate immune signaling (RIG-I, MDA5, or type I interferon [IFN] signaling) or infection with WNV. Using this approach, we found that several genes involved in T cell cosignaling and antigen processing were not enriched in DCs during WNV infection. Using cis-regulatory sequence analysis, STAT5 was identified as a regulator of DC activation and immune responses downstream of innate immune signaling that was not activated during either WNV or ZIKV infection. Mechanistically, WNV and ZIKV actively blocked STAT5 phosphorylation downstream of RIG-I, IFN-β, and interleukin-4 (IL-4), but not granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), signaling. Unexpectedly, dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 (DENV1 to DENV4) and the yellow fever 17D vaccine strain (YFV-17D) did not antagonize STAT5 phosphorylation. In contrast to WNV, ZIKV inhibited JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylation following type I IFN treatment, suggesting divergent mechanisms used by these viruses to inhibit STAT5 activation. Combined, these findings identify STAT5 as a target of antagonism by specific pathogenic flaviviruses to subvert the immune response in infected DCs.

TI  - Stress responses in flavivirus-infected cells: activation of unfolded protein response and autophagy
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 5
AB  - The Flavivirus is a genus of RNA viruses that includes multiple long known human, animal, and zoonotic pathogens such as Dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, or Japanese encephalitis virus, as well as other less known viruses that represent potential threats for human and animal health such as Usutu or Zika viruses. Flavivirus replication is based on endoplasmic reticulum-derived structures. Membrane remodeling and accumulation of viral factors induce endoplasmic reticulum stress that results in activation of a cellular signaling response termed unfolded protein response (UPR), which can be modulated by the viruses for their own benefit. Concomitant with the activation of the UPR, an upregulation of the autophagic pathway in cells infected with different flaviviruses has also been described. This review addresses the current knowledge of the relationship between endoplasmic reticulum stress, UPR, and autophagy in flavivirus-infected cells and the growing evidences for an involvement of these cellular pathways in the replication and pathogenesis of these viruses.

TI  - Structural and Functional Properties of the Capsid Protein of Dengue and Related Flavivirus
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 20
AB  - Dengue, West Nile and Zika, closely related viruses of the Flaviviridae family, are an increasing global threat, due to the expansion of their mosquito vectors. They present a very similar viral particle with an outer lipid bilayer containing two viral proteins and, within it, the nucleocapsid core. This core is composed by the viral RNA complexed with multiple copies of the capsid protein, a crucial structural protein that mediates not only viral assembly, but also encapsidation, by interacting with host lipid systems. The capsid is a homodimeric protein that contains a disordered N-terminal region, an intermediate flexible fold section and a very stable conserved fold region. Since a better understanding of its structure can give light into its biological activity, here, first, we compared and analyzed relevant mosquito-borne Flavivirus capsid protein sequences and their predicted structures. Then, we studied the alternative conformations enabled by the N-terminal region. Finally, using dengue virus capsid protein as main model, we correlated the protein size, thermal stability and function with its structure/dynamics features. The findings suggest that the capsid protein interaction with host lipid systems leads to minor allosteric changes that may modulate the specific binding of the protein to the viral RNA. Such mechanism can be targeted in future drug development strategies, namely by using improved versions of pep14-23, a dengue virus capsid protein peptide inhibitor, previously developed by us. Such knowledge can yield promising advances against Zika, dengue and closely related Flavivirus.

TI  - Structural and functional significance of Aedes aegypti AgBR1 flavivirus immunomodulator
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 99
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV), an arbovirus, relies on mosquitoes as vectors for its transmission. During blood feeding, mosquitoes inoculate saliva containing various proteins. Recently, AgBR1, an Aedes aegypti salivary gland protein, has gained attention for its immunomodulatory potential, along with another protein, called NeSt1. We have determined the crystal structure of AgBR1 at 1.2 Å resolution. Despite its chitinase-like fold, we demonstrated that AgBR1 does not bind to chitobiose or chitinhexaose, while a key mutation in the catalytic site abrogates enzymatic activity, suggesting that the protein’s function has been repurposed. Our study also shows that AgBR1 and NeSt1, when presented to murine primary macrophages, alter cellular pathways related to virus entry by endocytosis, immune response, and cell proliferation. AgBR1 (and NeSt1) do not directly bind to the Zika virus or modulate its replication. We propose that their immunomodulatory effects on Zika virus transmission are through regulation of host-cell response, a consequence of evolutionary cross talk and virus opportunism. These structural and functional insights are prerequisites for developing strategies to halt the spread of mosquito-borne disease. IMPORTANCE Our study informs on the structural and functional significance of a mosquito salivary gland protein, AgBR1 (along with another protein called NeSt1), in the transmission of the Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne virus that has caused global health concerns. By analyzing AgBR1’s three-dimensional structure in combination with cellular and interaction studies, we discovered that AgBR1 does not function like typical proteins in its family—it does not degrade sugars. However, we show that it primes immune cells in a way that could help the virus enter cells more easily but not by interacting with the virus or altering viral replication. This finding is significant because it reveals how mosquito proteins, repurposed by evolution, can influence virus transmission without the virus’s direct presence. Understanding how proteins like AgBR1 work could guide the development of new strategies to prevent Zika virus spread, with potential relevance for other mosquito-borne viruses.

TI  - Structural basis for STAT2 suppression by flavivirus NS5
JF  - Nature structural & molecular biology
VL  - 27
SP  - 875
EP  - 885
AB  - Suppressing cellular signal transducers of transcription 2 (STAT2) is a common strategy that viruses use to establish infections, yet the detailed mechanism remains elusive, owing to a lack of structural information about the viral–cellular complex involved. Here, we report the cryo-EM and crystal structures of human STAT2 (hSTAT2) in complex with the non-structural protein 5 (NS5) of Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV), revealing two-pronged interactions between NS5 and hSTAT2. First, the NS5 methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) domains form a conserved interdomain cleft harboring the coiled-coil domain of hSTAT2, thus preventing association of hSTAT2 with interferon regulatory factor 9. Second, the NS5 RdRP domain also binds the amino-terminal domain of hSTAT2. Disruption of these ZIKV NS5-hSTAT2 interactions compromised NS5-mediated hSTAT2 degradation and interferon suppression, and viral infection under interferon-competent conditions. Taken together, these results clarify the mechanism underlying the functional antagonism of STAT2 by both ZIKV and DENV. Cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography and mutational analyses reveal how Dengue and Zika virus protein NS5 suppresses STAT2 activity and interferon response in host cells.

TI  - Structural basis of Zika virus helicase in recognizing its substrates
JF  - Protein & Cell
VL  - 7
SP  - 562
EP  - 570
AB  - The recent explosive outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been reported in South and Central America and the Caribbean. Neonatal microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection has already caused a public health emergency of international concern. No specific vaccines or drugs are currently available to treat ZIKV infection. The ZIKV helicase, which plays a pivotal role in viral RNA replication, is an attractive target for therapy. We determined the crystal structures of ZIKV helicase-ATP-Mn2+ and ZIKV helicase-RNA. This is the first structure of any flavivirus helicase bound to ATP. Comparisons with related flavivirus helicases have shown that although the critical P-loop in the active site has variable conformations among different species, it adopts an identical mode to recognize ATP/Mn2+. The structure of ZIKV helicase-RNA has revealed that upon RNA binding, rotations of the motor domains can cause significant conformational changes. Strikingly, although ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV) apo-helicases share conserved residues for RNA binding, their different manners of motor domain rotations result in distinct individual modes for RNA recognition. It suggests that flavivirus helicases could have evolved a conserved engine to convert chemical energy from nucleoside triphosphate to mechanical energy for RNA unwinding, but different motor domain rotations result in variable RNA recognition modes to adapt to individual viral replication.

TI  - Structural Basis of Zika Virus Helicase in RNA Unwinding and ATP Hydrolysis.
JF  - ACS infectious diseases
AB  - The flavivirus nonstructural protein 3 helicase (NS3hel) is a multifunctional domain protein that is associated with DNA/RNA helicase, nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase), and RNA 5'-triphosphatase (RTPase) activities. As an NTPase-dependent superfamily 2 (SF2) member, NS3hel employs an NTP-driven motor force to unwind double-stranded RNA while translocating along single-stranded RNA and is extensively involved in the viral replication process. Although the structures of SF2 helicases are widely investigated as promising drug targets, the mechanism of energy transduction between NTP hydrolysis and the RNA binding sites in ZIKV NS3hel remains elusive. Here, we report the crystal structure of ZIKV NS3hel in complex with its natural substrates ATP-Mn2+ and ssRNA. Distinct from other members of the Flavivirus genus, ssRNA binding to ZIKV NS3hel induces relocation of the active water molecules and ATP-associated metal ions in the NTP hydrolysis active site, which promotes the hydrolysis of ATP and the production of AMP. Our findings highlight the importance of the allosteric role of ssRNA on the modulation of ATP hydrolysis and energy utilization.

TI  - Structural dynamics of Zika Virus NS1 via a reductionist approach reveal the disordered nature of its beta roll domain in isolation
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Flavivirus Non-structural 1 (NS1) protein performs multiple functions such as host immune evasion, interaction with complement system factors, membrane rearrangement, etc. Therefore, it is highly plausible that significant structural and folding dynamics of NS1 might play a role in its multifunctionality. The dimeric structures of NS1 of multiple flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), are available. However, its domain-wise dynamics perspective has not been explored so far. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand the structural conformations of NS1 and its domains in isolation, possibly highlighting the implications on the overall NS1 protein dynamics. Here, we have employed extensively long molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to understand the role of monomer, dimer, and a reductionist approach in understanding the dynamics of the three structural domains (i.e., β- roll, wing, and β-ladder) in isolation. Further, we experimentally validated our findings using CD spectroscopy and confirmed the intrinsically disordered behavior of NS1 β-roll in isolation and lipid mimetic environments. We also found that the β-ladder domain is highly flexible during long simulations. Therefore, we believe this study may have implications for significant dynamics played by NS1 protein, specifically during oligomerization of NS1. Graphical Abstract Schematic representation of the ZIKV NS1 protein and the models that we have used in this study.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne virus recently linked to intrauterine growth restriction including abnormal fetal brain development. The recent outbreak of ZIKV reached pandemic level resulting in an alarming public health emergency. At present, there is limited understanding of the infectious mechanism and no approved therapy. Nonstructural protein 5 is essential for capping and replication of viral RNA and comprises a methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase domain. Here we used molecular modeling to obtain the structure of ZIKV MTase and molecular docking to identify the additional hydrophobic region uniquely conserved in flavivirus MTase that can be used as a druggable site. Subsequently, a virtual screening with a library of 28 341 compounds identified 10 best hits showing decisive contacts with the MTase. In vitro efficacy analysis of these compounds against ZIKV, by plaque reduction assay, has confirmed four of the top scored ligands (Life Chemicals ID: F3043-0013, F0922-0796, F1609-0442, and F1750-0048) having EC50 (50% effective concentration) values of 4.8 ± 2.3, 12.5 ± 7.4, 17.5 ± 8.4, and 17.6 ± 3.1 μM respectively, identifying lead compounds for anti-ZIKV drug development.

JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 12
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the flavivirus genus, and its genome is approximately 10.8 kilobases of positive-strand RNA enclosed in a capsid and surrounded by a membrane. Studies on the replication dynamics of ZIKV are scarce, which limits the development of antiviral agents and vaccines directed against ZIKV. In this study, Aedes albopictus mosquito lineage cells (C6/36 cells) and African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero cells) were inoculated with a ZIKV sample isolated from a Brazilian patient, and the infection was characterized by immunofluorescence staining, phase contrast light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and real-time RT-PCR. The infection was observed in both cell lineages, and ZIKV particles were observed inside lysosomes, the rough endoplasmic reticulum and viroplasm-like structures. The susceptibility of C6/36 and Vero cells to ZIKV infection was demonstrated. Moreover, this study showed that part of the replicative cycle may occur within viroplasm-like structures, which has not been previously demonstrated in other flaviviruses.

AB  - Recent studies suggest a link between infection by Zika virus (ZIKV) and the development of neurological complications. The lack of ZIKV-specific therapeutics has alarmed healthcare professionals worldwide. Here, crystal structures of apo and AMPPNP- and Mn2+-bound forms of the essential helicase of ZIKV refined to 1.78 and 1.3 Å resolution, respectively, are reported. The structures reveal a conserved trimodular topology of the helicase. ATP and Mn2+ are tethered between two RecA-like domains by conserved hydrogen-bonding interactions. The binding of ligands induces the movement of backbone Cα and side-chain atoms. Numerous solvent molecules are observed in the vicinity of the AMPPNP, suggesting a role in catalysis. These high-resolution structures could be useful for the design of inhibitors targeting the helicase of ZIKV for the treatment of infections caused by ZIKV.

TI  - Structure and function of cis‐acting RNA elements of flavivirus
JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology
VL  - 30
AB  - The genus Flavivirus is a group of single‐stranded, positive‐sense RNA viruses that includes numerous human pathogens with global impact, such as dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). The approximately 11‐kilobase genome is flanked by highly structured untranslated regions (UTRs), which contain various cis‐acting RNA elements with unique structures and functions. Moreover, local RNA elements circularize the genome non‐covalently through long‐range interactions. Interestingly, many flavivirus cis‐acting RNA elements contain group‐specific motifs or are specific for the given phylogenetic groups, suggesting their potential association with flavivirus evolution and diversification. In this review, we summarize recent advances about the structure and function of cis‐acting RNA elements in flavivirus genomes and highlight the potential implications for flavivirus evolution. Finally, the scientific questions remained to be answered in the field are also discussed.

TI  - Structure and function of the Zika virus full-length NS5 protein
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 8
AB  - The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) has infected over 1 million people in over 30 countries. ZIKV replicates its RNA genome using virally encoded replication proteins. Nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) contains a methyltransferase for RNA capping and a polymerase for viral RNA synthesis. Here we report the crystal structures of full-length NS5 and its polymerase domain at 3.0 Å resolution. The NS5 structure has striking similarities to the NS5 protein of the related Japanese encephalitis virus. The methyltransferase contains in-line pockets for substrate binding and the active site. Key residues in the polymerase are located in similar positions to those of the initiation complex for the hepatitis C virus polymerase. The polymerase conformation is affected by the methyltransferase, which enables a more efficiently elongation of RNA synthesis in vitro. Overall, our results will contribute to future studies on ZIKV infection and the development of inhibitors of ZIKV replication. Zika virus infection can cause human birth defects and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Here the authors present the structures of the full-length nonstructural protein 5 and its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain of Zika virus, which are targets for inhibitors of virus replication.

AB  - Zika virus has emerged as a pathogen of major health concern. Here, we present a high-resolution (1.62-Å) crystal structure of the RNA helicase from the French Polynesia strain. The structure is similar to that of the RNA helicase from Dengue virus, with variability in the conformations of loops typically involved in binding ATP and RNA. We identify druggable 'hotspots' that are well suited for in silico and/or fragment-based high-throughput drug discovery.

TI  - Structure of the immature Zika virus at 9 Å resolution
JF  - Nature structural & molecular biology
VL  - 24
SP  - 184
EP  - 186
AB  - The current Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is characterized by severe pathogenicity in both children and adults. Sequence changes in ZIKV since its first isolation are apparent when pre-epidemic strains are compared with those causing the current epidemic. However, the residues that are responsible for ZIKV pathogenicity are largely unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the immature ZIKV at 9-Å resolution. The cryo-EM map was fitted with the crystal structures of the precursor membrane and envelope glycoproteins and was shown to be similar to the structures of other known immature flaviviruses. However, the immature ZIKV contains a partially ordered capsid protein shell that is less prominent in other immature flaviviruses. Furthermore, six amino acids near the interface between pr domains at the top of the spikes were found to be different between the pre-epidemic and epidemic ZIKV, possibly influencing the composition and structure of the resulting viruses.

TI  - Structure of the NS2B-NS3 protease from Zika virus after self-cleavage
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 7
AB  - The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the Americas represents a serious threat to the global public health. The viral protease that processes viral polyproteins during infection appears as an attractive drug target. Here we report a crystal structure at 1.84 Å resolution of ZIKV non-structural protein NS2B-NS3 protease with the last four amino acids of the NS2B cofactor bound at the NS3 active site. This structure represents a post-proteolysis state of the enzyme during viral polyprotein processing and provides insights into peptide substrate recognition by the protease. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies and protease activity assays unravel the protein dynamics upon binding the protease inhibitor BPTI in solution and confirm this finding. The structural and functional insights of the ZIKV protease presented here should advance our current understanding of flavivirus replication and accelerate structure-based antiviral drug discovery against ZIKV. The proteases of flaviviruses are promising targets for development of specific antiviral drugs. Here, the authors report a high resolution crystal structure of the NS2B-NS3 protease of Zika virus that provides insight into substrate and inhibitor binding.

TI  - Structures of flavivirus RNA promoters suggest two binding modes with NS5 polymerase
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 12
AB  - Flaviviruses use a ~70 nucleotide stem-loop structure called stem-loop A (SLA) at the 5′ end of the RNA genome as a promoter for RNA synthesis. Flaviviral polymerase NS5 specifically recognizes SLA to initiate RNA synthesis and methylate the 5′ guanosine cap. We report the crystal structures of dengue (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) SLAs. DENV and ZIKV SLAs differ in the relative orientations of their top stem-loop helices to bottom stems, but both form an intermolecular three-way junction with a neighboring SLA molecule. To understand how NS5 engages SLA, we determined the SLA-binding site on NS5 and modeled the NS5-SLA complex of DENV and ZIKV. Our results show that the gross conformational differences seen in DENV and ZIKV SLAs can be compensated by the differences in the domain arrangements in DENV and ZIKV NS5s. We describe two binding modes of SLA and NS5 and propose an SLA-mediated RNA synthesis mechanism. Flaviviruses use a ~70 nucleotide stem-loop structure called stem-loop A (SLA) at the 5’ end of the RNA genome as a promoter for RNA synthesis by the viral polymerase NS5. Here the authors describe the structures of dengue and Zika virus SLAs, identify the SLA-binding site on NS5, and propose models for how NS5 recognizes the RNA promoter.

TI  - Subgenomic flavivirus RNA binds the mosquito DEAD/H-box helicase ME31B and determines Zika virus transmission by Aedes aegypti
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 116
SP  - 19136
EP  - 19144
AB  - Significance Mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses such as Zika virus (ZIKV) are responsible for over 400 million human infections each year. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms that facilitate flavivirus transmission by mosquitoes remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that noncoding subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), that is produced by all flaviviruses, plays a critical role in ZIKV transmission by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. ZIKV requires sfRNA to overcome the mosquito midgut barrier and efficiently accumulate in the mosquito saliva. We reveal that the mosquito protein ME31B has antiviral activity and specifically binds to sfRNA. These results establish sfRNA as a determinant of ZIKV transmission by mosquitoes and provide mechanistic insights into the functions of this noncoding RNA. Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne flavivirus predominantly transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and poses a global human health threat. All flaviviruses, including those that exclusively replicate in mosquitoes, produce a highly abundant, noncoding subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) in infected cells, which implies an important function of sfRNA during mosquito infection. Currently, the role of sfRNA in flavivirus transmission by mosquitoes is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that an sfRNA-deficient ZIKV (ZIKVΔSF1) replicates similar to wild-type ZIKV in mosquito cell culture but is severely attenuated in transmission by Ae. aegypti after an infectious blood meal, with 5% saliva-positive mosquitoes for ZIKVΔSF1 vs. 31% for ZIKV. Furthermore, viral titers in the mosquito saliva were lower for ZIKVΔSF1 as compared to ZIKV. Comparison of mosquito infection via infectious blood meals and intrathoracic injections showed that sfRNA is important for ZIKV to overcome the mosquito midgut barrier and to promote virus accumulation in the saliva. Next-generation sequencing of infected mosquitoes showed that viral small-interfering RNAs were elevated upon ZIKVΔSF1 as compared to ZIKV infection. RNA-affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis uncovered that sfRNA specifically interacts with a specific set of Ae. aegypti proteins that are normally associated with RNA turnover and protein translation. The DEAD/H-box helicase ME31B showed the highest affinity for sfRNA and displayed antiviral activity against ZIKV in Ae. aegypti cells. Based on these results, we present a mechanistic model in which sfRNA sequesters ME31B to promote flavivirus replication and virion production to facilitate transmission by mosquitoes.

TI  - Subversion of the Heme Oxygenase-1 Antiviral Activity by Zika Virus
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the degradation of heme, is induced in response to a wide range of stress conditions. HO-1 exerts antiviral activity against a broad range of viruses, including the Hepatitis C virus, the human immunodeficiency virus, and the dengue virus by inhibiting viral growth. It has been reported that HO-1 displays antiviral activity against the Zika virus (ZIKV) but the mechanisms of viral inhibition remain largely unknown. Using a ZIKV RNA replicon with the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as a reporter protein, we were able to show that HO-1 expression resulted in the inhibition of viral RNA replication. Conversely, we observed a decrease in HO-1 expression in cells replicating the ZIKV RNA replicon. The study of human cells infected with ZIKV showed that the HO-1 expression level was significantly lower once viral replication was established, thereby limiting the antiviral effect of HO-1. Our work highlights the capacity of ZIKV to thwart the anti-replicative activity of HO-1 in human cells. Therefore, the modulation of HO-1 as a novel therapeutic strategy against ZIKV infection may display limited effect.

JF  - Biochemical Society transactions
VL  - 46 3
SP  - 609
EP  - 617
AB  - Viruses exploit host metabolic and defence machinery for their own replication. The flaviviruses, which include Dengue (DENV), Yellow Fever (YFV), Japanese Encephalitis (JEV), West Nile (WNV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, infect a broad range of hosts, cells and tissues. Flaviviruses are largely transmitted by mosquito bites and humans are usually incidental, dead-end hosts, with the notable exceptions of YFV, DENV and ZIKV. Infection by flaviviruses elicits cellular responses including cell death via necrosis, pyroptosis (involving inflammation) or apoptosis (which avoids inflammation). Flaviviruses exploit these mechanisms and subvert them to prolong viral replication. The different effects induced by DENV, WNV, JEV and ZIKV are reviewed. Host cell surface proteoglycans (PGs) bearing glycosaminoglycan (GAG) polysaccharides - heparan/chondroitin sulfate (HS/CS) - are involved in initial flavivirus attachment and during the expression of non-structural viral proteins play a role in disease aetiology. Recent work has shown that ZIKV-infected cells are protected from cell death by exogenous heparin (a GAG structurally similar to host cell surface HS), raising the possibility of further subtle involvement of HS PGs in flavivirus disease processes. The aim of this review is to synthesize information regarding DENV, WNV, JEV and ZIKV from two areas that are usually treated separately: the response of host cells to infection by flaviviruses and the involvement of cell surface GAGs in response to those infections.

TI  - Sugar feeding protects against arboviral infection by enhancing gut immunity in the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 17
AB  - As mosquito females require a blood meal to reproduce, they can act as vectors of numerous pathogens, such as arboviruses (e.g. Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses), which constitute a substantial worldwide public health burden. In addition to blood meals, mosquito females can also take sugar meals to get carbohydrates for their energy reserves. It is now recognised that diet is a key regulator of health and disease outcome through interactions with the immune system. However, this has been mostly studied in humans and model organisms. So far, the impact of sugar feeding on mosquito immunity and in turn, how this could affect vector competence for arboviruses has not been explored. Here, we show that sugar feeding increases and maintains antiviral immunity in the digestive tract of the main arbovirus vector Aedes aegypti. Our data demonstrate that the gut microbiota does not mediate the sugar-induced immunity but partly inhibits it. Importantly, sugar intake prior to an arbovirus-infected blood meal further protects females against infection with arboviruses from different families. Sugar feeding blocks arbovirus initial infection and dissemination from the gut and lowers infection prevalence and intensity, thereby decreasing the transmission potential of female mosquitoes. Finally, we show that the antiviral role of sugar is mediated by sugar-induced immunity. Overall, our findings uncover a crucial role of sugar feeding in mosquito antiviral immunity which in turn decreases vector competence for arboviruses. Since Ae. aegypti almost exclusively feed on blood in some natural settings, our findings suggest that this lack of sugar intake could increase the spread of mosquito-borne arboviral diseases.

TI  - SUMOylation and Viral Infections of the Brain
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) system regulates numerous biological processes, including protein localization, stability and/or activity, transcription, and DNA repair. SUMO also plays critical roles in innate immunity and antiviral defense by mediating interferon (IFN) synthesis and signaling, as well as the expression and function of IFN-stimulated gene products. Viruses including human immunodeficiency virus-1, Zika virus, herpesviruses, and coronaviruses have evolved to exploit the host SUMOylation system to counteract the antiviral activities of SUMO proteins and to modify their own proteins for viral persistence and pathogenesis. Understanding the exploitation of SUMO is necessary for the development of effective antiviral therapies. This review summarizes the interplay between viruses and the host SUMOylation system, with a special emphasis on viruses with neuro-invasive properties that have pathogenic consequences on the central nervous system.

TI  - Super resolution microscopy and deep learning identify Zika virus reorganization of the endoplasmic reticulum
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 10
AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex subcellular organelle composed of diverse structures such as tubules, sheets and tubular matrices. Flaviviruses such as Zika virus (ZIKV) induce reorganization of ER membranes to facilitate viral replication. Here, using 3D super resolution microscopy, ZIKV infection is shown to induce the formation of dense tubular matrices associated with viral replication in the central ER. Viral non-structural proteins NS4B and NS2B associate with replication complexes within the ZIKV-induced tubular matrix and exhibit distinct ER distributions outside this central ER region. Deep neural networks trained to distinguish ZIKV-infected versus mock-infected cells successfully identified ZIKV-induced central ER tubular matrices as a determinant of viral infection. Super resolution microscopy and deep learning are therefore able to identify and localize morphological features of the ER and allow for better understanding of how ER morphology changes due to viral infection.

TI  - Superb feeding behavior of Aedes albopictus transmitting Zika virus
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 12
AB  - Disease-mediated mosquitoes have been receiving much attention, as the World Health Organization recently declared the Zika virus a global public health emergency. Mosquitoes transmit pathogens that cause various tropical diseases including malaria, dengue fever and yellow fever as well as Zika virus. The vector efficiency of mosquitoes depends on their blood-feeding characteristics and the mechanics of their blood-sucking pump system, but only a few studies have attempted to investigate these key issues. In this study, we demonstrate the rapid and gluttonous liquid-feeding characteristics of Ae. albopictus which transmits Zika virus can be explained by similar proportion of two blood-sucking pumps and accelerated liquid intake driven by fast expanding of pumps. Our results provide insight into the vector efficiency of Ae. albopictus in terms of feeding velocity, pumping frequency, liquid-intake rate, and wall shear stress.

TI  - Supramolecular arrangement of the full-length Zika virus NS5
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 15
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, has emerged as a major public health threat, since ZIKV infection has been connected to microcephaly and other neurological disorders. Flavivirus genome replication is driven by NS5, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that also contains a N-terminal methyltransferase domain essential for viral mRNA capping. Given its crucial roles, ZIKV NS5 has become an attractive antiviral target. Here, we have used integrated structural biology approaches to characterize the supramolecular arrangement of the full-length ZIKV NS5, highlighting the assembly and interfaces between NS5 monomers within a dimeric structure, as well as the dimer-dimer interactions to form higher order fibril-like structures. The relative orientation of each monomer within the dimer provides a model to explain the coordination between MTase and RdRP domains across neighboring NS5 molecules and mutational studies underscore the crucial role of the MTase residues Y25, K28 and K29 in NS5 dimerization. The basic residue K28 also participates in GTP binding and competition experiments indicate that NS5 dimerization is disrupted at high GTP concentrations. This competition represents a first glimpse at a molecular level explaining how dimerization might regulate the capping process.

TI  - Systematic identification and characterization of Aedes aegypti long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 9
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play diverse roles in biological processes. Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti), a blood-sucking mosquito, is the principal vector responsible for replication and transmission of arboviruses including dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya virus. Systematic identification and developmental characterisation of Ae. aegypti lncRNAs are still limited. We performed genome-wide identification of lncRNAs, followed by developmental profiling of lncRNA in Ae. aegypti. We identified a total of 4,689 novel lncRNA transcripts, of which 2,064, 2,076, and 549 were intergenic, intronic, and antisense respectively. Ae. aegypti lncRNAs share many characteristics with other species including low expression, low GC content, short in length, and low conservation. Besides, the expression of Ae. aegypti lncRNAs tend to be correlated with neighbouring and antisense protein-coding genes. A subset of lncRNAs shows evidence of maternal inheritance; hence, suggesting potential role of lncRNAs in early-stage embryos. Additionally, lncRNAs show higher tendency to be expressed in developmental and temporal specific manner. The results from this study provide foundation for future investigation on the function of Ae. aegypti lncRNAs.

TI  - Targeting host metabolism by inhibition of acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase reduces flavivirus infection in mouse models
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 8
SP  - 624
EP  - 636
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses are (re)-emerging RNA viruses strictly dependent on lipid metabolism for infection. In the search for host targeting antivirals, we explored the effect of pharmacological modulation of fatty acid metabolism during flavivirus infection. Considering the central role of acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) on fatty acid metabolism, we analyzed the effect of three small-molecule ACC inhibitors (PF-05175157, PF-05206574, and PF-06256254) on the infection of medically relevant flaviviruses, namely West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus, and Zika virus. Treatment with these compounds inhibited the multiplication of the three viruses in cultured cells. PF-05175157 induced a reduction of the viral load in serum and kidney in WNV-infected mice, unveiling its therapeutic potential for the treatment of chronic kidney disease associated with persistent WNV infection. This study constitutes a proof of concept of the reliability of ACC inhibitors to become viable antiviral candidates. These results support the repositioning of metabolic inhibitors as broad-spectrum antivirals.

TI  - Targeting SUMO Modification of the Non-Structural Protein 5 of Zika Virus as a Host-Targeting Antiviral Strategy
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 20
AB  - Post-translational modifications of host or viral proteins are key strategies exploited by viruses to support virus replication and counteract host immune response. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification process mediated by a family of ubiquitin-like proteins called small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins. Multiple sequence alignment of 78 representative flaviviruses showed that most (72/78, 92.3%) have a putative SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) at their non-structural 5 (NS5) protein’s N-terminal domain. The putative SIM was highly conserved among 414 pre-epidemic and epidemic Zika virus (ZIKV) strains, with all of them having a putative SIM core amino acid sequence of VIDL (327/414, 79.0%) or VVDL (87/414, 21.0%). Molecular docking predicted that the hydrophobic SIM core residues bind to the β2 strand of the SUMO-1 protein, and the acidic residues flanking the core strengthen the binding through interactions with the basic surface of the SUMO protein. The SUMO inhibitor 2-D08 significantly reduced replication of flaviviruses and protected cells against ZIKV-induced cytopathic effects in vitro. A SIM-mutated ZIKV NS5 failed to efficiently suppress type I interferon signaling. Overall, these findings may suggest SUMO modification of the viral NS5 protein to be an evolutionarily conserved post-translational modification process among flaviviruses to enhance virus replication and suppress host antiviral response.

TI  - Targeting the inositol-requiring enzyme-1 pathway efficiently reverts Zika virus-induced neurogenesis and spermatogenesis marker perturbations.
JF  - ACS infectious diseases
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus that may be associated with congenital anomalies in infected fetuses and severe neurological and genital tract complications in infected adults. Currently, antiviral treatments to revert these ZIKV-induced complications are lacking. ZIKV infection has recently been suggested to upregulate the host unfolded protein response, which may contribute to the congenital neurological anomalies. Extending from these findings, we thoroughly investigated ZIKV-induced unfolded protein response using a combination of neuronal cell line, induced pluripotent stem cells-derived human neuronal stem and progenitor cells, and an interferon receptor-deficient A129 mouse model. Our results revealed a critical contribution of the inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) arm of the unfolded protein response to ZIKV-induced neurological and testicular complications. Importantly, inhibiting IRE1 signaling pathway activation with KIRA6 (Kinase-Inhibiting RNAse Attenuator 6), a selective small molecule IRE1 inhibitor that promotes cell survival, potently reverted the ZIKV-induced perturbations of the key gene expressions associated with neurogenesis and spermatogenesis in vitro and in vivo, highlighting the potential of IRE1 inhibition as a novel host-targeting antiviral strategy in combating against ZIKV-induced neurological and testicular pathologies.

TI  - Targeting Type I Interferon Induction and Signaling: How Zika Virus Escapes from Host Innate Immunity
JF  - International Journal of Biological Sciences
VL  - 19
SP  - 3015
EP  - 3028
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causes neurological disorders and draws great attention. ZIKV infection can elicit a wide range of immune response. Type I interferons (IFNs) as well as its signaling cascade play crucial role in innate immunity against ZIKV infection and in turn ZIKV can antagonize them. ZIKV genome are mainly recognized by Toll-like receptors 3 (TLR3), TLR7/8 and RIG-I-like receptor 1 (RIG-1), which induces the expression of Type I IFNs and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs exert antiviral activity at different stages of the ZIKV life cycle. On the other hand, ZIKV takes multiple strategies to antagonize the Type Ⅰ IFN induction and its signaling pathway to establish a pathogenic infection, especially by using the viral nonstructural (NS) proteins. Most of the NS proteins can directly interact with the factors in the pathways to escape the innate immunity. In addition, structural proteins also participate in the innate immune evasion and activation of antibody-binding of blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA2) or inflammasome also be used to enhance ZIKV replication. In this review, we summarize the recent findings about the interaction between ZIKV infection and type I IFNs pathways and suggest potential strategies for antiviral drug development.

TI  - Tetraspanins: Host Factors in Viral Infections
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 22
AB  - Tetraspanins are transmembrane glycoproteins that have been shown increasing interest as host factors in infectious diseases. In particular, they were implicated in the pathogenesis of both non-enveloped (human papillomavirus (HPV)) and enveloped (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Zika, influenza A virus, (IAV), and coronavirus) viruses through multiple stages of infection, from the initial cell membrane attachment to the syncytium formation and viral particle release. However, the mechanisms by which different tetraspanins mediate their effects vary. This review aimed to compare and contrast the role of tetraspanins in the life cycles of HPV, HIV, Zika, IAV, and coronavirus viruses, which cause the most significant health and economic burdens to society. In doing so, a better understanding of the relative contribution of tetraspanins in virus infection will allow for a more targeted approach in the treatment of these diseases.

TI  - TGF-β1 Promotes Zika Virus Infection in Immortalized Human First-Trimester Trophoblasts via the Smad Pathway
JF  - Cells
VL  - 11
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) is well known for causing congenital Zika syndrome if the infection occurs during pregnancy; however, the mechanism by which the virus infects and crosses the placenta barrier has not been completely understood. In pregnancy, TGF-β1 is abundant at the maternal–fetal interface. TGF-β1 has been reported to enhance rubella virus binding and infection in human lung epithelial cells. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the role of TGF-β1 in ZIKV infection in the immortalized human first-trimester trophoblasts, i.e., Swan.71. The cells were treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL) for two days before being inoculated with the virus (American strain PRVABC59) at a multiplicity of infection of five. The results showed an enhancement of ZIKV infection, as demonstrated by the immunofluorescent assay and flow cytometry analysis. Such enhanced infection effects were abolished using SB431542 or SB525334, inhibitors of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. An approximately 2-fold increase in the virus binding to the studied trophoblasts was found. In the presence of the Smad inhibitors, virus replication was significantly suppressed. An enhancement in Tyro3 and AXL (receptors for ZIKV) expression induced by TGF-β1 was also noted. The results suggest that TGF-β1 promotes the virus infection via the Smad pathway. Further studies should be carried out to clarify the underlying mechanisms of these findings.

TI  - The Ablation of Envelope Protein Glycosylation Enhances the Neurovirulence of ZIKV and Cell Apoptosis in Newborn Mice
JF  - Journal of Immunology Research
VL  - 2021
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has attracted the wide global attention due to its causal link to microcephaly. In this study, two amino acid (aa) mutation (E143K and R3394K) were identified at the fourth generation (named ZKC2P4) during the serial passage of ZIKV-Asian lineage ZKC2/2016 strain in the newborn mouse brain, while another seven aa deletions in envelope (E) protein were detected in ZKC2P6. ZKC2P6 is a novel nonglycosylated E protein Asian ZIKV we first identified and provides the first direct supporting evidence that glycosylation motif could be lost during the passage in neonatal mice. To study the impact of E protein glycosylation ablation, we compared the pathogenicity of ZKC2P6 with that of ZKC2P4. The results showed that the loss of E protein glycosylation accelerated the disease progression, as evidenced by an earlier weight loss and death, a thinner cerebral cortex, and more serious tissue lesions and inflammation/necrosis. Furthermore, ZKC2P6 exhibited a greater ability to replicate and caused severer cell apoptosis than that of ZKC2P4. Therefore, the ablation of E glycosylation generally enhances the neurovirulence of ZIKV and cell apoptosis in newborn mice.

TI  - The actin nucleator Spir-1 is a virus restriction factor that promotes innate immune signalling
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 18
AB  - Cellular proteins often have multiple and diverse functions. This is illustrated with protein Spir-1 that is an actin nucleator, but, as shown here, also functions to enhance innate immune signalling downstream of RNA sensing by RIG-I/MDA-5. In human and mouse cells lacking Spir-1, IRF3 and NF-κB-dependent gene activation is impaired, whereas Spir-1 overexpression enhanced IRF3 activation. Furthermore, the infectious virus titres and sizes of plaques formed by two viruses that are sensed by RIG-I, vaccinia virus (VACV) and Zika virus, are increased in Spir-1 KO cells. These observations demonstrate the biological importance of Spir-1 in the response to virus infection. Like cellular proteins, viral proteins also have multiple and diverse functions. Here, we also show that VACV virulence factor K7 binds directly to Spir-1 and that a diphenylalanine motif of Spir-1 is needed for this interaction and for Spir-1-mediated enhancement of IRF3 activation. Thus, Spir-1 is a new virus restriction factor and is targeted directly by an immunomodulatory viral protein that enhances virus virulence and diminishes the host antiviral responses.

TI  - The Aedes aegypti Domino Ortholog p400 Regulates Antiviral Exogenous Small Interfering RNA Pathway Activity and ago-2 Expression
JF  - mSphere
VL  - 5
AB  - Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are vectors of human-infecting arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). In recent decades, the incidence of arthropod-borne viral infections has grown dramatically. Vector competence is influenced by many factors, including the mosquito’s antiviral defenses. The exogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway is a major antiviral response restricting arboviruses in mosquitoes. While the roles of the effectors of this pathway, Argonaute-2 and Dicer-2 are well characterized, nothing is known about its regulation in mosquitoes. In this study, we demonstrate that A. aegypti p400, whose ortholog Domino in Drosophila melanogaster is a chromatin-remodeling ATPase member of the Tip60 complex, regulates siRNA pathway activity and controls ago-2 expression levels. In addition, we found p400 to have antiviral activity against different arboviruses. Therefore, our study provides new insights into the regulation of the antiviral response in A. aegypti mosquitoes. ABSTRACT Arboviruses are pathogens of humans and animals. A better understanding of the interactions between these pathogens and the arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes, that transmit them is necessary to develop novel control measures. A major antiviral pathway in the mosquito vector is the exogenous small interfering RNA (exo-siRNA) pathway, which is induced by arbovirus-derived double-stranded RNA in infected cells. Although recent work has shown the key role played by Argonaute-2 (Ago-2) and Dicer-2 (Dcr-2) in this pathway, the regulatory mechanisms that govern these pathways have not been studied in mosquitoes. Here, we show that the Domino ortholog p400 has antiviral activity against the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (Togaviridae) both in Aedes aegypti-derived cells and in vivo. Antiviral activity of p400 was also demonstrated against chikungunya virus (Togaviridae) and Bunyamwera virus (Peribunyaviridae) but not Zika virus (Flaviviridae). p400 was found to be expressed across mosquito tissues and regulated ago-2 but not dcr-2 transcript levels in A. aegypti mosquitoes. These findings provide novel insights into the regulation of an important aedine exo-siRNA pathway effector protein, Ago-2, by the Domino ortholog p400. They add functional insights to previous observations of this protein’s antiviral and RNA interference regulatory activities in Drosophila melanogaster.

TI  - The Aedes aegypti peritrophic matrix controls arbovirus vector competence through HPx1, a heme–induced peroxidase
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 19
AB  - Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the main vectors of arboviruses. The peritrophic matrix (PM) is an extracellular layer that surrounds the blood bolus and acts as an immune barrier that prevents direct contact of bacteria with midgut epithelial cells during blood digestion. Here, we describe a heme-dependent peroxidase, hereafter referred to as heme peroxidase 1 (HPx1). HPx1 promotes PM assembly and antioxidant ability, modulating vector competence. Mechanistically, the heme presence in a blood meal induces HPx1 transcriptional activation mediated by the E75 transcription factor. HPx1 knockdown increases midgut reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the DUOX NADPH oxidase. Elevated ROS levels reduce microbiota growth while enhancing epithelial mitosis, a response to tissue damage. However, simultaneous HPx1 and DUOX silencing was not able to rescue bacterial population growth, as explained by increased expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which occurred only after double knockdown. This result revealed hierarchical activation of ROS and AMPs to control microbiota. HPx1 knockdown produced a 100-fold decrease in Zika and Dengue 2 midgut infection, demonstrating the essential role of the mosquito PM in the modulation of arbovirus vector competence. Our data show that the PM connects blood digestion to midgut immunological sensing of the microbiota and viral infections.

TI  - The Aedes aegypti siRNA pathway mediates broad-spectrum defense against human pathogenic viruses and modulates antibacterial and antifungal defenses
JF  - PLoS Biology
VL  - 20
AB  - The mosquito’s innate immune system defends against a variety of pathogens, and the conserved siRNA pathway plays a central role in the control of viral infections. Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of Dicer2 (Dcr2) or R2d2 resulted in an accumulation of 21-nucleotide viral sequences that was accompanied by a significant suppression of dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) replication, thus indicating the broad-spectrum antiviral response mediated by the siRNA pathway that can be applied for the development of novel arbovirus control strategies. Interestingly, overexpression of Dcr2 or R2d2 regulated the mRNA abundance of a variety of antimicrobial immune genes, pointing to additional functions of DCR2 and R2D2 as well as cross-talk between the siRNA pathway and other immune pathways. Accordingly, transgenic overexpression of Dcr2 or R2d2 resulted in a lesser proliferation of the midgut microbiota and increased resistance to bacterial and fungal infections.

TI  - The aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH1B1 exerts antiviral effects through the aggregation of the adaptor MAVS
JF  - Science Signaling
VL  - 17
AB  - Type I interferons (IFNs) are produced by almost all cell types and play a vital role in host defense against viral infection. Infection with an RNA virus activates receptors such as RIG-I, resulting in the recruitment of the adaptor protein MAVS to the RIG-I–like receptor (RLR) signalosome and the formation of prion-like functional aggregates of MAVS, which leads to IFN-β production. Here, we identified the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1 (ALDH1B1) as a previously uncharacterized IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) product with critical roles in the antiviral response. Knockout of ALDH1B1 increased, whereas overexpression of ALDH1B1 restricted, the replication of RNA viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and influenza A virus (IAV). We found that ALDH1B1 localized to mitochondria, where it interacted with the transmembrane domain of MAVS to promote MAVS aggregation. ALDH1B1 was recruited to MAVS aggregates. In addition, ALDH1B1 also enhanced the interaction between activated RIG-I and MAVS, thus increasing IFN-β production and the antiviral response. Furthermore, Aldh1b1−/− mice developed more severe symptoms than did wild-type mice upon IAV infection. Together, these data identify an aldehyde dehydrogenase in mitochondria that functionally regulates MAVS-mediated signaling and the antiviral response. An enzyme involved in ethanol metabolism also enhances host defenses against RNA-based viruses. Editor’s summary Detection of RNA-based viruses by the receptor RIG-I induces the aggregation of the mitochondrial protein MAVS, which in turn stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines critical for host defenses. Sun et al. found that this antiviral response was enhanced by ALDH1B1, a mitochondrially localized aldehyde dehydrogenase involved in ethanol metabolism. ALDH1B1, whose abundance was increased by infection with clinically relevant RNA viruses, limited viral replication. Interaction of ALDH1B1 with MAVS enhanced its aggregation and its association with RIG-I. ALDH1B1-deficient mice had higher viral titers in the lung, developed more severe lung damage, and were less likely to survive infection with influenza A. Thus, ALDH1B1 promotes antiviral signaling pathways initiated by RIG-I and MAVS. —Wei Wong

TI  - The Antimalarial Compound Atovaquone Inhibits Zika and Dengue Virus Infection by Blocking E Protein-Mediated Membrane Fusion
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Flaviviruses bear class II fusion proteins as their envelope (E) proteins. Here, we describe the development of an in vitro quantitative mosquito-cell-based membrane-fusion assay for the E protein using dual split proteins (DSPs). The assay does not involve the use of live viruses and allows the analysis of a membrane-fusion step independent of other events in the viral lifecycle, such as endocytosis. The progress of membrane fusion can be monitored continuously by measuring the activities of Renilla luciferase derived from the reassociation of DSPs during cell fusion. We optimized the assay to screen an FDA-approved drug library for a potential membrane fusion inhibitor using the E protein of Zika virus. Screening results identified atovaquone, which was previously described as an antimalarial agent. Atovaquone potently blocked the in vitro Zika virus infection of mammalian cells with an IC90 of 2.1 µM. Furthermore, four distinct serotypes of dengue virus were also inhibited by atovaquone with IC90 values of 1.6–2.5 µM, which is a range below the average blood concentration of atovaquone after its oral administration in humans. These findings make atovaquone a likely candidate drug to treat illnesses caused by Zika as well as dengue viruses. Additionally, the DSP assay is useful to study the mechanism of membrane fusion in Flaviviruses.

TI  - The antiparasitic drug niclosamide inhibits dengue virus infection by interfering with endosomal acidification independent of mTOR
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 12
AB  - Background The antiparasitic agent niclosamide has been demonstrated to inhibit the arthropod-borne Zika virus. Here, we investigated the antiviral capacity of niclosamide against dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 infection in vitro and in vivo. Principle finding Niclosamide effectively retarded DENV-induced infection in vitro in human adenocarcinoma cells (A549), mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a), and baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21). Treatment with niclosamide did not retard the endocytosis of DENV while niclosamide was unable to enhance the antiviral type I interferon response. Furthermore, niclosamide did not cause a direct effect on viral replicon-based expression. Niclosamide has been reported to competitively inhibit the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling pathways; however, selective inhibitors of those pathways did not reduce DENV infection. Similar to the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, both niclosamide and other protonophores, such as CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone), and FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), effectively reduced endosomal acidification and viral dsRNA replication. Co-administration of a single dose of niclosamide partially decreased viral replication, viral encephalitis, and mortality in DENV-infected ICR suckling mice. Significance These results demonstrate that niclosamide diminishes viral infection by hindering endosomal acidification.

TI  - The antiviral effect of metformin on zika and dengue virus infection
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 11
AB  - The Dengue (DENV) and zika (ZIKV) virus infections are currently a public health concern. At present, there is no treatment or a safe and effective vaccine for these viruses. Hence, the development of new strategies as host-directed therapy is required. In this sense, Metformin (MET), an FDA-approved drug used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, has shown an anti-DENV effect in vitro by activating AMPK and reducing HMGCR activity. In this study, MET treatment was evaluated during in vitro and in vivo ZIKV infection and compared to MET treatment during DENV infection. Our results demonstrated that MET has a broad in vitro antiviral spectrum. MET inhibited ZIKV infection in different cell lines, but it was most effective in inhibiting DENV and yellow fever virus (YFV) infection in Huh-7 cells. However, the drug failed to protect against ZIKV infection when AG129 immunodeficient mice were used as in vivo model. Interestingly, MET increased DENV-infected male mice's survival time, reducing the severe signs of the disease. Together, these findings indicate that, although MET was an effective antiviral agent to inhibit in vitro and in vivo DENV infection, it could only inhibit in vitro ZIKV infection.

TI  - The Antiviral Potential of AdipoRon, an Adiponectin Receptor Agonist, Reveals the Ability of Zika Virus to Deregulate Adiponectin Receptor Expression
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a pathogenic member of the flavivirus family, with several unique characteristics. Unlike any other arbovirus, ZIKV can be transmitted sexually and maternally, and thus produce congenital syndromes (CZS) due to its neurotropism. This challenges the search for safe active molecules that can protect pregnant women and their fetuses. In this context, and in the absence of any existing treatment, it seemed worthwhile to test whether the known cytoprotective properties of adiponectin and its pharmacological analog, AdipoRon, could influence the outcome of ZIKV infection. We showed that both AdipoRon and adiponectin could significantly reduce the in vitro infection of A549 epithelial cells, a well-known cell model for flavivirus infection studies. This effect was particularly observed when a pre-treatment was carried out. Conversely, ZIKV revealed an ability to downregulate adiponectin receptor expression and thereby limit adiponectin signaling.

TI  - The Antiviral Small-Interfering RNA Pathway Induces Zika Virus Resistance in Transgenic Aedes aegypti
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - The resurgence of arbovirus outbreaks across the globe, including the recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in 2015–2016, emphasizes the need for innovative vector control methods. In this study, we investigated ZIKV susceptibility to transgenic Aedes aegypti engineered to target the virus by means of the antiviral small-interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway. The robustness of antiviral effector expression in transgenic mosquitoes is strongly influenced by the genomic insertion locus and transgene copy number; we therefore used CRISPR/Cas9 to re-target a previously characterized locus (Chr2:321382225) and engineered mosquitoes expressing an inverted repeat (IR) dsRNA against the NS3/4A region of the ZIKV genome. Small RNA analysis revealed that the IR effector triggered the mosquito’s siRNA antiviral pathway in bloodfed females. Nearly complete (90%) inhibition of ZIKV replication was found in vivo in both midguts and carcasses at 7 or 14 days post-infection (dpi). Furthermore, significantly fewer transgenic mosquitoes contained ZIKV in their salivary glands (p = 0.001), which led to a reduction in the number of ZIKV-containing saliva samples as measured by transmission assay. Our work shows that Ae. aegypti innate immunity can be co-opted to engineer mosquitoes resistant to ZIKV.

TI  - The buzz in the field: the interaction between viruses, mosquitoes, and metabolism
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - Among many medically important pathogens, arboviruses like dengue, Zika and chikungunya cause severe health and economic burdens especially in developing countries. These viruses are primarily vectored by mosquitoes. Having surmounted geographical barriers and threat of control strategies, these vectors continue to conquer many areas of the globe exposing more than half of the world’s population to these viruses. Unfortunately, no medical interventions have been capable so far to produce successful vaccines or antivirals against many of these viruses. Thus, vector control remains the fundamental strategy to prevent disease transmission. The long-established understanding regarding the replication of these viruses is that they reshape both human and mosquito host cellular membranes upon infection for their replicative benefit. This leads to or is a result of significant alterations in lipid metabolism. Metabolism involves complex chemical reactions in the body that are essential for general physiological functions and survival of an organism. Finely tuned metabolic homeostases are maintained in healthy organisms. However, a simple stimulus like a viral infection can alter this homeostatic landscape driving considerable phenotypic change. Better comprehension of these mechanisms can serve as innovative control strategies against these vectors and viruses. Here, we review the metabolic basis of fundamental mosquito biology and virus-vector interactions. The cited work provides compelling evidence that targeting metabolism can be a paradigm shift and provide potent tools for vector control as well as tools to answer many unresolved questions and gaps in the field of arbovirology.

TI  - The Cellular NMD Pathway Restricts Zika Virus Infection and Is Targeted by the Viral Capsid Protein
JF  - mBio
VL  - 9
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a significant global health threat, as infection has been linked to serious neurological complications, including microcephaly. Using a human stem cell-derived neural progenitor model system, we find that a critical cellular quality control process called the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway is disrupted during ZIKV infection. Importantly, disruption of the NMD pathway is a known cause of microcephaly and other neurological disorders. We further identify an interaction between the capsid protein of ZIKV and up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1), the master regulator of NMD, and show that ZIKV capsid targets UPF1 for degradation. Together, these results offer a new mechanism for how ZIKV infection can cause neuropathology in the developing brain. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in utero is associated with neurological disorders, such as microcephaly, but a detailed molecular understanding of ZIKV-induced pathogenesis is lacking. Here we show that in vitro ZIKV infection of human cells, including NPCs, causes disruption of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. NMD is a cellular mRNA surveillance mechanism that is required for normal brain size in mice. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we identified multiple cellular NMD factors that bind to the viral capsid protein, including the central NMD regulator up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1). Endogenous UPF1 interacted with the ZIKV capsid protein in coimmunoprecipitation experiments, and capsid expression posttranscriptionally downregulated UPF1 protein levels, a process that we confirmed occurs during ZIKV infection. Cellular fractionation studies show that the ZIKV capsid protein specifically targets nuclear UPF1 for degradation via the proteasome. A further decrease in UPF1 levels by RNAi significantly enhanced ZIKV infection in NPC cultures, consistent with a model in which NMD restricts ZIKV infection in the fetal brain. We propose that ZIKV, via the capsid protein, has evolved a strategy to lower UPF1 levels and dampen antiviral activities of NMD, which in turn contributes to neuropathology in vivo. IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) is a significant global health threat, as infection has been linked to serious neurological complications, including microcephaly.

JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 10
AB  - The circadian clock regulates immune responses to microbes and affects pathogen replication, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that the circadian components BMAL1 and REV-ERBα influence several steps in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle, including particle entry into hepatocytes and RNA genome replication. Genetic knock out of Bmal1 and over-expression or activation of REV-ERB with synthetic agonists inhibits the replication of HCV and the related flaviruses dengue and Zika via perturbation of lipid signaling pathways. This study highlights a role for the circadian clock component REV-ERBα in regulating flavivirus replication. The circadian clock can affect pathogen replication, but underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here the authors demonstrate that the circadian components BMAL1 and REV-ERBα affect entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV) into hepatocytes and genome replication of HCV and related flaviviruses dengue and zika.

TI  - The clinically approved antiviral drug sofosbuvir inhibits Zika virus replication
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family, along with other agents of clinical significance such as dengue (DENV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses. Since ZIKV causes neurological disorders during fetal development and in adulthood, antiviral drugs are necessary. Sofosbuvir is clinically approved for use against HCV and targets the protein that is most conserved among the members of the Flaviviridae family, the viral RNA polymerase. Indeed, we found that sofosbuvir inhibits ZIKV RNA polymerase, targeting conserved amino acid residues. Sofosbuvir inhibited ZIKV replication in different cellular systems, such as hepatoma (Huh-7) cells, neuroblastoma (SH-Sy5y) cells, neural stem cells (NSC) and brain organoids. In addition to the direct inhibition of the viral RNA polymerase, we observed that sofosbuvir also induced an increase in A-to-G mutations in the viral genome. Together, our data highlight a potential secondary use of sofosbuvir, an anti-HCV drug, against ZIKV.

TI  - The Complement System in Flavivirus Infections
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - The incidence of flavivirus infections has increased dramatically in recent decades in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, affecting hundreds of millions of people each year. The Flaviviridae family includes dengue, West Nile, Zika, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever viruses that are typically transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks, and cause a wide range of symptoms, such as fever, shock, meningitis, paralysis, birth defects, and death. The flavivirus genome is composed of a single positive-sense RNA molecule encoding a single viral polyprotein. This polyprotein is further processed by viral and host proteases into three structural proteins (C, prM/M, E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) that are involved in viral replication and pathogenicity. The complement system has been described to play an important role in flavivirus infection either by protecting the host and/or by influencing disease pathogenesis. In this mini-review, we will explore the role of complement system inhibition and/or activation against infection by the Flavivirus genus, with an emphasis on dengue and West Nile viruses.

AB  - An outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been reported in South and Central America and the Caribbean. Neonatal microcephaly potentially associated with ZIKV infection has already caused a public health emergency of international concern. Currently, there are no clinically effective vaccines or antiviral drugs available to treat ZIKV infection. The methyltransferase domain (MTase) of ZIKV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) can sequentially methylate guanine N-7 and ribose 2′-O to form m7NGpppA2′Om cap structure in the new RNA transcripts. This methylation step is crucial for ZIKV replication cycle and evading the host immune system, making it a target for drug design. Here, we present the 1.76 Å crystal structure of ZIKV MTase in complex with the byproduct SAH, providing insight into the elegant methylation process, which will benefit the following antiviral drug development.

TI  - The cytoplasmic N-terminal tail of Zika virus NS4A protein forms oligomers in the absence of detergent or lipids
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 13
AB  - The non-structural (NS) NS4A protein in flaviviruses has three predicted transmembrane domains, is critical for virulence and participates in membrane morphogenesis. In Dengue virus (DENV), both hydrophylic N-terminal tail and its first transmembrane domain participate in the formation of oligomers which are important for pathogenicity. However, the relative importance of the N-terminal domain in oligomerization has been under debate. In particular, since in the absence of detergent or lipids, this domain (residues 1–48) in both DENV and Zika virus (ZIKV) NS4A, was found to be disordered. Recently, however, we reported preliminary data that showed that peptide ZIKV NS4A 4–58 adopts a defined secondary structure in aqueous solution and forms oligomers, signaling its importance for full length NS4A oligomerization. Herein we have performed detailed analytical ultracentrifugation experiments to further characterize the oligomerization of this peptide and also a shorter variant (residues 4–44). In both cases, sedimentation velocity produced a single species with concentration-dependent sedimentation coefficient, consistent with a fast equilibrium between at least two species. Combining sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments, data is best fitted to a monomer–dimer–trimer equilibrium. Possible models of NS4A oligomers obtained with AlphaFold-2 predict the stabilizing role for residues in this N-terminal domain, such as Arg20, Asn27, Ala44 and Glu50, all at highly conserved positions in flavivirus NS4A proteins. Our results are thus consistent with N-terminal domain interactions acting as one of the driving forces for NS4A homo-oligomerization.

TI  - The E3 ligase TRIM56 is a host restriction factor of Zika virus and depends on its RNA-binding activity but not miRNA regulation, for antiviral function
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 13
AB  - Infection by Zika virus (ZIKV) is linked to microcephaly and other neurological disorders, posing a significant health threat. Innate immunity is the first line of defense against invading pathogens, but relatively little is understood regarding host intrinsic mechanisms that guard against ZIKV. Here, we show that host tripartite motif-containing protein 56 (TRIM56) poses a barrier to ZIKV infection in cells of neural, epithelial and fibroblast origins. Overexpression of TRIM56, but not an E3 ligase-dead mutant or one lacking a short C-terminal portion, inhibited ZIKV RNA replication. Conversely, depletion of TRIM56 increased viral RNA levels. Although the C-terminal region of TRIM56 bears sequence homology to NHL repeat of TRIM-NHL proteins that regulate miRNA activity, knockout of Dicer, which abolishes production of miRNAs, had no demonstrable effect on ZIKV restriction imposed by TRIM56. Rather, we found that TRIM56 is an RNA-binding protein that associates with ZIKV RNA in infected cells. Moreover, a recombinant TRIM56 fragment comprising the C-terminal 392 residues captured ZIKV RNA in cell-free reactions, indicative of direct interaction. Remarkably, deletion of a short C-terminal tail portion abrogated the TRIM56-ZIKV RNA interaction, concomitant with a loss in antiviral activity. Altogether, our study reveals TRIM56 is an RNA binding protein that acts as a ZIKV restriction factor and provides new insights into the antiviral mechanism by which this E3 ligase tackles flavivirus infections.

TI  - The entanglement between flaviviruses and ER-shaping proteins
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a continuous intracellular membrane system that composes the nuclear envelope and radiates out to the peripheries of the cell, transitioning from ribosome-studded, flat cisternal sheets to highly curved reticulated tubules. It has been implicated in a diverse array of cellular functions, including production, trafficking, and degradation of proteins; synthesis and distribution of lipids and steroids; calcium sequestration and release; cell signaling and innate immunity; carbohydrate metabolism; and detoxification of harmful substances [1]. Such a ubiquitous and functionally versatile organelle is parasitized by viruses in order to facilitate their life cycle. Rotavirus, vaccinia virus (VV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as members of the Flavivirus genus—dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV)—are all intimately associated with the ER [2]. The flaviviruses replicate on the ER membranes and form immature viral particles that bud into the ER lumen. These particles are then trafficked through the ER–Golgi network and undergo a maturation process brought about by pH alteration and cleavage by the hostprotease Furin. This viral takeover of the ER requires the co-opting of cellular proteins as well as the active remodeling of the ER membrane to create a cellular environment more conducive to replication [3]. Several ER proteins have been identified as host factors in flavivirus replication [4], but a class of resident proteins that shape and maintain the dynamic ER architecture are of particular interest. These “ER-shaping” proteins could potentially serve as host factors that support viral replication or restriction factors that protect the ER. Interactome and CRISPR screens have produced somewhat discordant results, but the less stringent screens suggest that ER-shaping proteins may be targets of viral proteins [5] [6] [7]. This Pearl review will explore the virus-induced ER-membrane rearrangement and the relationship between ER-shaping proteins and the flavivirus life cycle.

TI  - The envelope protein of Zika virus interacts with apolipoprotein E early in the infectious cycle and this interaction is conserved on the secreted viral particles
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 19
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, has caused massive outbreaks of infection in tropical areas over the last decade and has now begun spreading to temperate countries. Little is currently known about the specific host factors involved in the intracellular life cycle of ZIKV. Flaviviridae viruses interact closely with host-cell lipid metabolism and associated secretory pathways. Another Flaviviridae, hepatitis C virus, is highly dependent on apolipoprotein E (ApoE) for the completion of its infectious cycle. We therefore investigated whether ZIKV also interacted with this protein. ZIKV infections were performed on both liver and microglia derived cell lines in order to proceed to colocalization analysis and immunoprecipitation assays of ApoE and Zika envelope glycoprotein (Zika E). Transmission electron microscopy combined to immunogold labeling was also performed on the infected cells and related supernatant to study the association of ApoE and Zika E protein in the virus-induced membrane rearrangements and secreted particles, respectively. Finally, the potential of neutralization of anti-ApoE antibodies on ZIKV particles was studied. We demonstrated an interaction between ApoE and the Zika E protein. This specific interaction was observed in virus-induced host-cell membrane rearrangements, but also on newly formed intracellular particles. The partial neutralizing effect of anti-ApoE antibody and the immunogold labeling of the two proteins on secreted virions indicates that this interaction is conserved during ZIKV intracellular trafficking and release. These data suggest that another member of the Flaviviridae also interacts with ApoE, indicating that this could be a common mechanism for the viruses from this family.

TI  - The Envelope Residues E152/156/158 of Zika Virus Influence the Early Stages of Virus Infection in Human Cells
JF  - Cells
VL  - 8
AB  - Emerging infections of mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) pose an increasing threat to human health, as documented over the recent years in South Pacific islands and the Americas in recent years. To better understand molecular mechanisms underlying the increase in human cases with severe pathologies, we recently demonstrated the functional roles of structural proteins capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM), and envelop (E) of ZIKV epidemic strains with the initiation of viral infection in human cells. Specifically, we found that the C-prM region contributes to permissiveness of human host cells to ZIKV infection and ZIKV-induced cytopathic effects, whereas the E protein is associated with viral attachment and early infection. In the present study, we further characterize ZIKV E proteins by investigating the roles of residues isoleucine 152 (Ile152), threonine 156 (Thr156), and histidine 158 (His158) (i.e., the E-152/156/158 residues), which surround a unique N-glycosylation site (E-154), in permissiveness of human host cells to epidemic ZIKV infection. For comparison purpose, we generated mutant molecular clones of epidemic BeH819015 (BR15) and historical MR766-NIID (MR766) strains that carry each other’s E-152/156/158 residues, respectively. We observed that the BR15 mutant containing the E-152/156/158 residues from MR766 was less infectious in A549-Dual™ cells than parental virus. In contrast, the MR766 mutant containing E-152/156/158 residues from BR15 displayed increased infectivity. The observed differences in infectivity were, however, not correlated with changes in viral binding onto host-cells or cellular responses to viral infection. Instead, the E-152/156/158 residues from BR15 were associated with an increased efficiency of viral membrane fusion inside infected cells due to conformational changes of E protein that enhance exposure of the fusion loop. Our data highlight an important contribution of E-152/156/158 residues to the early steps of ZIKV infection in human cells.

TI  - The Flavivirus Non-Structural Protein 5 (NS5): Structure, Functions, and Targeting for Development of Vaccines and Therapeutics
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 12
AB  - Flaviviruses, including dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), yellow fever (YFV), and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) viruses, pose a significant global emerging threat. With their potential to cause widespread outbreaks and severe health complications, the development of effective vaccines and antiviral therapeutics is imperative. The flaviviral non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is a highly conserved and multifunctional protein that is crucial for viral replication, and the NS5 protein of many flaviviruses has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of interferon (IFN) signalling. In this review, we discuss the functions of NS5, diverse NS5-mediated strategies adopted by flaviviruses to evade the host antiviral response, and how NS5 can be a target for the development of vaccines and antiviral therapeutics.

TI  - The flavivirus polymerase NS5 regulates translation of viral genomic RNA
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 48
SP  - 5081
EP  - 5093
AB  - Abstract Flaviviruses, including dengue virus and Zika virus, contain a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome that encodes viral proteins essential for replication and also serves as the template for new genome synthesis. As these processes move in opposite directions along the genome, translation must be inhibited at a defined point following infection to clear the template of ribosomes to allow efficient replication. Here, we demonstrate in vitro and in cell-based assays that the viral RNA polymerase, NS5, inhibits translation of the viral genome. By reconstituting translation in vitro using highly purified components, we show that this translation block occurs at the initiation stage and that translation inhibition depends on NS5-RNA interaction, primarily through association with the 5′ replication promoter region. This work supports a model whereby expression of a viral protein signals successful translation of the infecting genome, prompting a switch to a ribosome depleted replication-competent form.

TI  - The glycosylation deficiency of flavivirus NS1 attenuates virus replication through interfering with the formation of viral replication compartments
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 31
AB  - Background Flavivirus is a challenge all over the world. The replication of flavivirus takes place within membranous replication compartments (RCs) derived from endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Flavivirus NS1 proteins have been proven essential for the formation of viral RCs by remodeling the ER. The glycosylation of flavivirus NS1 proteins is important for viral replication, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Methods HeLa cells were used to visualize the ER remodeling effects induced by NS1 expression. ZIKV replicon luciferase assay was performed with BHK-21 cells. rZIKV was generated from BHK-21 cells and the plaque assay was done with Vero Cells. Liposome co-floating assay was performed with purified NS1 proteins from 293T cells. Results We found that the glycosylation of flavivirus NS1 contributes to its ER remodeling activity. Glycosylation deficiency of NS1, either through N-glycosylation sites mutations or tunicamycin treatment, compromises its ER remodeling activity and interferes with viral RCs formation. Disruption of NS1 glycosylation results in abnormal aggregation of NS1, rather than reducing its membrane-binding activity. Consequently, deficiency in NS1 glycosylation impairs virus replication. Conclusions In summary, our results highlight the significance of NS1 glycosylation in flavivirus replication and elucidate the underlying mechanism. This provides a new strategy for combating flavivirus infections. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12929-024-01048-z.

TI  - The hnRNP A2B1 is important for the replication of SFTSV and other RNA viruses
JF  - Microbiology Spectrum
VL  - 12
AB  - ABSTRACT The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP A2B1) is a key component of the hnRNP complex involving RNA modulation in eukaryotic cells and it has also been reported to be involved in the replication of the hepatitis E virus, influenza A virus, and hepatitis B virus. However, it is not clear whether the role of the hnRNP A2B1 in viral replication is conserved among RNA viruses and what is the mechanism of hnRNP A2B1 in RNA virus replication. In this study, we first used severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a tick-borne RNA virus that causes a severe viral hemorrhagic fever as well as other RNA viruses including VSV-GFP, SeV, EV71, and ZIKV to demonstrate that knockout hnRNPA2B1 gene inhibited viral RNA replication and overexpression of hnRNP A2B1 could restore the RNA levels of all tested RNA viruses. These results suggest that hnRNPA2B1 upregulation of viral replication is conserved among RNA viruses. Next, we demonstrated that hnRNP A2B1 was translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm under RNA virus infection including SFTSV, VSV-GFP, SeV, EV71, and ZIKV, suggesting translocation of hnRNP A2B1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is crucial for RNA virus replication. We then used SFTSV as a model to demonstrate the mechanism of hnRNP A2B1 in the promotion of RNA virus replication. We found that overexpression of SFTSV nucleoprotein can also cause hnRNP A2B1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and that the SFTSV NP interacted with the RNA recognition motif 1 domain of hnRNP A2B1. We further demonstrated that the hnRNP A2B1 interacted with the 5′ UTR of SFTSV RNA. In conclusion, we revealed that the hnRNP A2B1 upregulation of viral RNA replication is conserved among RNA viruses; the mechanism of hnRNP A2B1 in promotion of SFTSV viral RNA replication is that SFTSV NP interacted with the hnRNPA2B1 to retain it in the cytoplasm where the hnRNP A2B1 interacted with the 5′ UTR of SFTSV RNA to promote the viral RNA replication. IMPORTANCE Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a tick-borne RNA virus with a high mortality rate of up to 30%. In this study, we first used SFTSV as a model to demonstrate that the role of hnRNPA2B1 in viral replication is conserved in SFTSV. Then we used other RNA viruses, including VSV-GFP, SeV, EV71, and ZIKV, to repeat the experiment and demonstrated the same results as SFTSV in all tested RNA viruses. By knocking out the hnRNPA2B1 gene, SFTSV RNA replication was inhibited, and overexpression of hnRNPA2B1 restored RNA levels of SFTSV and other tested RNA viruses. We revealed a novel mechanism where the SFTSV nucleoprotein interacts with hnRNPA2B1, retaining it in the cytoplasm. This interaction promotes viral RNA replication by binding to the 5′ UTR of SFTSV RNA. The findings suggest that targeting hnRNPA2B1 could be a potential strategy for developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapies, given its conserved role across different RNA viruses. This research provides significant insights into the replication mechanisms of RNA viruses and highlights potential targets for antiviral interventions.

TI  - The host antiviral ribonuclease L protein supports Zika virus replication factory formation to enhance infectious virus production
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) activates ribonuclease L (RNase L) catalytic antiviral function during infection, yet deletion of RNase L decreases ZIKV production, suggesting a proviral role of RNase L. In this study, we reveal that latent RNase L supports ZIKV replication factory (RF) assembly. Deletion of RNase L induced broader cellular distribution of ZIKV dsRNA and NS3 compared with densely concentrated RFs detected in WT cells. An inactive form of RNase L was sufficient to contain ZIKV genome and dsRNA within a smaller area, which increased levels of viral RNA within RFs as well as infectious ZIKV released from the cell. We used a microtubule stabilization drug to demonstrate that RNase L deletion impaired the cytoskeleton rearrangements that are required for proper generation of RFs. During infection with dengue or West Nile Kunjin viruses, RNase L decreased virus production, suggesting that RNase L proviral function is specific to ZIKV.

JF  - Science immunology
VL  - 9
SP  - eadk9872
EP  - eadk9872
AB  - The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a vector of many infectious agents, including flaviviruses such as Zika virus. Components of mosquito saliva have pleomorphic effects on the vertebrate host to enhance blood feeding, and these changes also create a favorable niche for pathogen replication and dissemination. Here, we demonstrate that human CD47, which is known to be involved in various immune processes, interacts with a 34-kilodalton mosquito salivary protein named Nest1. Nest1 is up-regulated in blood-fed female A. aegypti and facilitates Zika virus dissemination in human skin explants. Nest1 has a stronger affinity for CD47 than its natural ligand, signal regulatory protein α, competing for binding at the same interface. The interaction between Nest1 with CD47 suppresses phagocytosis by human macrophages and inhibits proinflammatory responses by white blood cells, thereby suppressing antiviral responses in the skin. This interaction elucidates how an arthropod protein alters the human response to promote arbovirus infectivity. A mosquito salivary protein binds to CD47 and inhibits host immune responses, facilitating arbovirus infection in the skin. Editor’s summary Aedes aegypti mosquitos can transmit arboviruses during blood feeding, and components of mosquito saliva may enhance both blood feeding and virus transmission. Marin-Lopez et al. identified a 34-kDa mosquito salivary protein called Nest1, highly expressed in the saliva of female A. aegypti mosquitos, as a high-affinity binder to human CD47. In human skin explants infected with Zika virus, Nest1 increased virus burden and inhibited some CD47-governed immune functions like phagocytosis and proinflammatory responses in immune cells, thus inhibiting antiviral responses. These findings provide insight into how mosquito salivary proteins can potentially facilitate arbovirus infection. —Christiana Fogg

Infections in pregnant women can increase the risk of miscarriage or serious birth defects, including brain anomalies and microcephaly. ABSTRACT The ability of viruses to evade the host antiviral immune system determines their level of replication fitness, species specificity, and pathogenic potential. Flaviviruses rely on the subversion of innate immune barriers, including the type I and type III interferon (IFN) antiviral systems. Zika virus infection induces the degradation of STAT2, an essential component of the IFN-stimulated gene transcription factor ISGF3. The mechanisms that lead to STAT2 degradation by Zika virus are poorly understood, but it is known to be mediated by the viral NS5 protein that binds to STAT2 and targets it for proteasome-mediated destruction. To better understand how NS5 engages and degrades STAT2, functional analysis of the protein interactions that lead to Zika virus and NS5-dependent STAT2 proteolysis were investigated. Data implicate the STAT2 coiled-coil domain as necessary and sufficient for NS5 interaction and proteasome degradation after Zika virus infection. Molecular dissection reveals that the first two α-helices of the STAT2 coiled-coil domain contain a specific targeting region for IFN antagonism. These functional interactions provide a more complete understanding of the essential protein-protein interactions needed for Zika virus evasion of the host antiviral response and identify new targets for antiviral therapeutic approaches. IMPORTANCE Zika virus infection can cause mild fever, rash, and muscle pain and in rare cases can lead to brain or nervous system diseases, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Infections in pregnant women can increase the risk of miscarriage or serious birth defects, including brain anomalies and microcephaly. There are no drugs or vaccines for Zika disease. Zika virus is known to break down the host antiviral immune response, and this research project reveals how the virus suppresses interferon signaling, and may reveal therapeutic vulnerabilities.

TI  - The immunology of Zika Virus
JF  - F1000Research
VL  - 7
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) was initially thought to cause only mild, self-limiting symptoms. However, recent outbreaks have been associated with the autoimmune disease Guillain-Barré syndrome and causally linked to a congenital malformation known as microcephaly. This has led to an urgent need for a safe and effective vaccine. A comprehensive understanding of the immunology of ZIKV infection is required to aid in the design of such a vaccine. Whilst details of both innate and adaptive immune responses to ZIKV are emerging, further research is needed. As immunopathogenesis has been implicated in poor outcomes following infection with the related dengue virus, identification of cross-reactive immune responses between flaviviruses and the impact they may have on disease progression is also of high importance.

TI  - The inflammasome components NLRP3 and ASC act in concert with IRGM to rearrange the Golgi during viral infections
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection triggers Golgi fragmentation through the Golgi-resident protein immunity-related GTPase M (IRGM). Here, we report the role of NLRP3 and ASC, two inflammasome components, in the initial events leading to this fragmentation. We show that ASC resides at the Golgi with IRGM at homeostasis. Upon infection, ASC dissociates from both IRGM and Golgi and associates with HCV-induced NLRP3. NLRP3 silencing inhibits Golgi fragmentation. ASC silencing disrupts the Golgi structure in both control and infected cells and reduces the localization of IRGM at the Golgi. Silencing IRGM cannot totally restore the Golgi structure. These data highlight a role for ASC, upstream of the formation of the inflammasome, in regulating IRGM through its control on the Golgi. A similar mechanism occurs in response to Nigericin or infection with Zika virus (ZIKV). We propose a model for a newly ascribed function of the inflammasome components in Golgi structural remodeling.

TI  - The influence of culture-dependent native microbiota in Zika virus infection in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 15
AB  - Emerging and re-emerging vector-borne diseases (VBDs) pose a recurring threat to tropical countries, mainly due to the abundance and distribution of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is a vector of the Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever arboviruses. Female 3–5 day-old Ae. aegypti were distributed into two experimental groups: group I—survey of cultivable bacteria; sucrose group: fed only on sucrose, i.e., non-blood-fed (UF); blood-fed group: (i) fed with non-infected blood (BF); (ii) fed with blood infected with the Zika virus (BZIKV); (iii) pretreated with penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep), and fed with non-infected blood (TBF); (iv) pretreated with pen/strep and fed blood infected with ZIKV, i.e., gravid with developed ovaries, (TGZIKV); group II—experimental co-infections: bacteria genera isolated from the group fed on sucrose, i.e., non-blood-fed (UF). Using the cultivable method and the same mosquito colony and ZIKV strain described by in a previous work, our results reveled 11 isolates (Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Cedecea, Cellulosimicrobium, Elizabethkingia, Enterobacter, Lysinibacillus, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Staphylococcus). Enterobacter was present in all evaluated groups (i.e., UF, BF, BZIKV, TBF, and TGZIKV), whereas Elizabethkingia was present in the UF, BZIKV, and TBF groups. Pseudomonas was present in the BZIKV and TBF groups, whereas Staphylococcus was present in the TBF and TGZIKV groups. The only genera of bacteria that were found to be present in only one group were Aeromonas, Lysinibacillus, and Serratia (UF); Cedacea, Pantoea and Acinetobacter (BF); and Cellulosimicrobium (BZIKV). The mosquitoes co-infected with ZIKV plus the isolates group fed on sucrose (UF) showed interference in the outcome of infection. We demonstrate that the distinct feeding aspects assessed herein influence the composition of bacterial diversity. In the co-infection, among ZIKV, Ae. aegypti and the bacterial isolates, the ZIKV/Lysinibacillus–Ae. aegypti had the lowest number of viral copies in the head-SG, which means that it negatively affects vector competence. However, when the saliva was analyzed after forced feeding, no virus was detected in the mosquito groups ZIKV/Lysinibacillus–Lu. longipalpis and Ae. aegypti; the combination of ZIKV/Serratia may interfere in salivation. This indicates that the combinations do not produce viable viruses and may have great potential as a method of biological control.

TI  - The Innate Defense in the Zika-Infected Placenta
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus and was first isolated 1947 in Uganda, Africa, from the serum of a sentinel Rhesus monkey. Since its discovery, the virus was responsible for major outbreaks in several different countries, being linked to severe complications in pregnant women, neonatal birth defects and the congenital zika syndrome. Maternal–fetal transmission of ZIKV can occur in all trimesters of pregnancy, and the role of the placenta and its cells in these cases is yet to be fully understood. The decidua basalis and chorionic villi, maternal–fetal components of the placenta, contain a rich immunological infiltrate composed by Hofbauer cells, mastocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages, primary cells of the innate immune response that have a role that still needs to be better investigated in ZIKV infection. Recent studies have already described several histopathological features and the susceptibility and permissiveness of placenta cells to infection by the Zika virus. In this review, we address some of the current knowledge on the innate immune responses against ZIKV, especially in the placenta.

TI  - The innate immune response in Zika virus infection
JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology
VL  - 31
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) was discovered in 1947 in Uganda, Africa, from the serum of a sentinel Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). It is an enveloped, positive‐sense, single‐stranded RNA virus, which encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved into 10 individual proteins. In 2015, the Zika‐epidemic in Brazil was marked mainly by the exponential growth of microcephaly cases and other congenital defects. With regard to host–pathogen relationships, understanding the role of the immune response in the pathogenesis ZIKV infection is challenging. The innate immune response is the first‐line immunological defence, in which pathogen‐associated molecular patterns are recognized by pattern‐recognition receptors that trigger macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells and endothelial cells to produce several mediators, which modulate viral replication and immune evasion. In this review, we have summarized current knowledge on the innate immune response against ZIKV.

TI  - The interaction of GRP78 and Zika virus E and NS1 proteins occurs in a chaperone-client manner
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 14
AB  - Glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is a chaperone protein that is a central mediator of the unfolded protein response, a key cellular stress response pathway. GRP78 has been shown to be critically required for infection and replication of a number of flaviviruses, and to interact with both non-structural (NS) and structural flavivirus proteins. However, the nature of the specific interaction between GRP78 and viral proteins remains largely unknown. This study aimed to characterize the binding domain and critical amino acid residues that mediate the interaction of GRP78 to ZIKV E and NS1 proteins. Recombinant EGFP fused GRP78 and individual subdomains (the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and the substrate binding domain (SBD)) were used as a bait protein and co-expressed with full length or truncated ZIKV E and NS1 proteins in HEK293T/17 cells. Protein–protein interactions were determined by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. From the results, both the NBD and the SBD of GRP78 were crucial for an effective interaction. Single amino acid substitutions in the SBD showed that R492E and T518A mutants significantly reduced the binding affinity of GRP78 to ZIKV E and NS1 proteins. Notably, the interaction of GRP78 with ZIKV E was stably maintained against various single amino acid substitutions on ZIKV E domain III and with all truncated ZIKV E and NS1 proteins. Collectively, the results suggest that the principal binding between GRP78 and viral proteins is mainly a classic canonical chaperone protein-client interaction. The blocking of GRP78 chaperone function effectively inhibited ZIKV infection and replication in neuronal progenitor cells. Our findings reveal that GRP78 is a potential host target for anti-ZIKV therapeutics.

AB  - Zika virus is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus originally isolated from humans in 1952. Following its re-emergence in Brazil in 2015, an increase in the number of babies born with microcephaly to infected mothers was observed. Microcephaly is a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterised phenotypically by a smaller than average head size, and is usually developed in utero. The 2015 outbreak in the Americas led to the World Health Organisation declaring Zika a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Since then, much research into the effects of Zika has been carried out. Studies have investigated the structure of the virus, its effects on and evasion of the immune response, cellular entry including target receptors, its transmission from infected mother to foetus and its cellular targets. This review discusses current knowledge and novel research into these areas, in hope of developing a further understanding of how exposure of pregnant women to the Zika virus can lead to impaired brain development of their foetus. Although no longer considered an epidemic in the Americas, the mechanism by which Zika acts is still not comprehensively and wholly understood, and this understanding will be crucial in developing effective vaccines and treatments.

JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 10

EP  - 1389
AB  - ABSTRACT The vector-borne flaviviruses (VBFVs) are well known for causing great misery and death in humans worldwide. The VBFVs include those transmitted by mosquitos, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus; and those transmitted by ticks including the tick-borne flavivirus serocomplex and Powassan virus (POWV). Two of our recent reports showed that intracranial POWV infection in the reservoir host, Peromyscus leucopus, was restricted and caused no overt clinical disease. Several modes of analyses suggested activation of the LXR pathway. Activation of the LXR pathway leads to increased efflux of cholesterol from cells and consequent disturbances in membrane biogenesis. Because VBFV replication is dependent on membrane biogenesis, we evaluated the effect of an LXR agonist (LXR623) on POWV and ZIKV infection and observed that the compound impaired permissive replication of both viruses in a human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line. The LXR agonist resulted in failure of the viruses to induce ER expansion and elaborate vesicle formation, suggesting that the efflux of cholesterol was part of the antiviral mechanism. We also observed that the LXR agonist contributed to the mechanism of virus suppression by increased expression of mRNAs encoding for the antiviral cytokines CXCL10, RANTES and IFN1β. In sharp contrast, a LXR antagonist (GSK2033) had no significant effect on VBFV replication. We conclude that LXR623 impairs flavivirus replication by stimulating cellular antiviral factors.

TI  - The Mechanism of the Zika Virus Crossing the Placental Barrier and the Blood-Brain Barrier
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causes severe neurological symptoms in adults and fetal microcephaly and the virus is detected in the brain of microcephaly and meningoencephalitis patient. However, the mechanism of ZIKV crossing the physiological barrier to the central nervous systems (CNS) remains elusive. The placental barrier and the blood brain barrier (BBB) protect the fetus from pathogens and ensure healthy brain development during pregnancy. In this study, we used human placenta trophoblasts cells (JEG-3) and human brain-derived endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) as in vitro models of the physiological barriers. Results showed that ZIKV could infect JEG-3 cells effectively and reduce the amounts of ZO-1 and occludin between adjacent cells by the proteasomal degradation pathway, suggesting that the permeability of the barrier differentially changed in response to ZIKV infection, allowing the virus particle to cross the host barrier. In contrast, ZIKV could infect hCMEC/D3 cells without disrupting the BBB barrier permeability and tight junction protein expression. Although no disruption to the BBB was observed during ZIKV infection, ZIKV particles were released on the basal side of the BBB model and infected underlying cells. In addition, we observed that fluorescence-labeled ZIKV particles could cross the in vitro placenta barrier and BBB model by transcytosis and the action of transcytosis could be blocked by either low temperature or pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis. In summary, the ZIKV uses a cell-type specific paracellular pathway to cross the placenta monolayer barrier by disrupting cellular tight junction. In addition, the ZIKV can also cross both the placenta barrier and the BBB by transcytosis. Our study provided new insights into on the mechanism of the cellular barrier penetration of ZIKV particles.

TI  - The mitotic spindle: linking teratogenic effects of Zika virus with human genetics?
JF  - Molecular Cytogenetics
VL  - 9
AB  - Recently, an association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly/ocular findings was found to be reasonable e.g. because of the demonstration that the virus was found in the brain of a fetus after presumed maternal infection. Although there is no proof yet for a causal relationship, for an appropriate risk calculation efforts are urgently needed to either establish or disprove this assumption. On the basis of inherited syndromes combining microcephaly with ocular findings similar to those associated with Zika infections, we have hypothesized that the impairment of the proper function of the mitotic apparatus is a possible mechanism by which Zika can exert teratogenic effects. A bundle of well-known cytogenetic and molecular-cytogenetic methods (e.g. formation of micronuclei, chromosomal lagging, immunofluorescence of centrosomes) to evaluate proper function, maintenance, and establishment of the mitotic spindle poles can be applied on infected cells. Also, the viral proteins can be tested for their possible interaction with proteins encoded by genes involved in inherited syndromes with microcephaly and ocular findings resembling those in presumed cases of intrauterine ZIKV infection. Once proved, this hypothesis allows for a targeted approach into mechanisms of possible relevance as e.g. if different strains of the virus are implicated in the teratogenic effects to the same or a different extent.

TI  - The Molecular Basis of Viral Inhibition of IRF- and STAT-Dependent Immune Responses
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 9
AB  - The antiviral innate immunity is the first line of host defense against virus infections. In mammalian cells, viral infections initiate the expression of interferons (IFNs) in the host that in turn activate an antiviral defense program to restrict viral replications by induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), which are largely regulated by the IFN-regulatory factor (IRF) family and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family transcription factors. The mechanisms of action of IRFs and STATs involve several post-translational modifications, complex formation, and nuclear translocation of these transcription factors. However, many viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV), have evolved strategies to evade host defense, including alteration in IRF and STAT post-translational modifications, disturbing the formation and nuclear translocation of the transcription complexes as well as proteolysis/degradation of IRFs and STATs. In this review, we discuss and summarize the molecular mechanisms by which how viral components may target IRFs and STATs to antagonize the establishment of antiviral host defense. The underlying host-viral interactions determine the outcome of viral infection. Gaining mechanistic insight into these processes will be crucial in understanding how viral replication can be more effectively controlled and in developing approaches to improve virus infection outcomes.

TI  - The Molecular Interactions of ZIKV and DENV with the Type-I IFN Response
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 8
AB  - Zika Virus (ZIKV) and Dengue Virus (DENV) are related viruses of the Flavivirus genus that cause significant disease in humans. Existing control measures have been ineffective at curbing the increasing global incidence of infection for both viruses and they are therefore prime targets for new vaccination strategies. Type-I interferon (IFN) responses are important in clearing viral infection and for generating efficient adaptive immune responses towards infection and vaccination. However, ZIKV and DENV have evolved multiple molecular mechanisms to evade type-I IFN production. This review covers the molecular interactions, from detection to evasion, of these viruses with the type-I IFN response. Additionally, we discuss how this knowledge can be exploited to improve the design of new vaccine strategies.

TI  - The mosquito protein AEG12 displays both cytolytic and antiviral properties via a common lipid transfer mechanism
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 118
AB  - Significance Lipid-enveloped viruses such as flaviviruses and coronaviruses underlie numerous human illnesses. Strategies which target this shared membrane feature may be useful as broad-spectrum antiviral agents. The mosquito protein AEG12 disrupts lipid membranes via delivery of a fatty acid in exchange for diacylphospholipids. This mechanism allows the mosquito to digest red blood cells after a meal and disrupts lipid coat viruses as part of the mosquito immune response to infection. It may be possible to engineer this strategy for human therapeutics. The mosquito protein AEG12 is up-regulated in response to blood meals and flavivirus infection though its function remained elusive. Here, we determine the three-dimensional structure of AEG12 and describe the binding specificity of acyl-chain ligands within its large central hydrophobic cavity. We show that AEG12 displays hemolytic and cytolytic activity by selectively delivering unsaturated fatty acid cargoes into phosphatidylcholine-rich lipid bilayers. This property of AEG12 also enables it to inhibit replication of enveloped viruses such as Dengue and Zika viruses at low micromolar concentrations. Weaker inhibition was observed against more distantly related coronaviruses and lentivirus, while no inhibition was observed against the nonenveloped virus adeno-associated virus. Together, our results uncover the mechanistic understanding of AEG12 function and provide the necessary implications for its use as a broad-spectrum therapeutic against cellular and viral targets.

TI  - The Multifaceted Roles of Autophagy in Flavivirus-Host Interactions
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 19
AB  - Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process in which intracellular components are eliminated via lysosomal degradation to supply nutrients for organelle biogenesis and metabolic homeostasis. Flavivirus infections underlie multiple human diseases and thus exert an immense burden on public health worldwide. Mounting evidence indicates that host autophagy is subverted to modulate the life cycles of flaviviruses, such as hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The diverse interplay between autophagy and flavivirus infection not only regulates viral growth in host cells but also counteracts host stress responses induced by viral infection. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of autophagy in the flavivirus life cycle. We also discuss the impacts of virus-induced autophagy on the pathogeneses of flavivirus-associated diseases and the potential use of autophagy as a therapeutic target for curing flavivirus infections and related human diseases.

TI  - The Multiples Fates of the Flavivirus RNA Genome During Pathogenesis
JF  - Frontiers in Genetics
VL  - 9
AB  - The Flavivirus genus comprises many viruses (including dengue, Zika, West Nile and yellow fever viruses) which constitute important public health concerns worldwide. For several of these pathogens, neither antivirals nor vaccines are currently available. In addition to this unmet medical need, flaviviruses are of particular interest since they constitute an excellent model for the study of spatiotemporal regulation of RNA metabolism. Indeed, with no DNA intermediate or nuclear step, the flaviviral life cycle entirely relies on the cytoplasmic fate of a single RNA species, namely the genomic viral RNA (vRNA) which contains all the genetic information necessary for optimal viral replication. From a single open reading frame, the vRNA encodes a polyprotein which is processed to generate the mature viral proteins. In addition to coding for the viral polyprotein, the vRNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis and is also selectively packaged into newly assembled viral particles. Notably, vRNA translation, replication and encapsidation must be tightly coordinated in time and space via a fine-tuned equilibrium as these processes cannot occur simultaneously and hence, are mutually exclusive. As such, these dynamic processes involve several vRNA secondary and tertiary structures as well as RNA modifications. Finally, the vRNA can be detected as a foreign molecule by cytosolic sensors which trigger upon activation antiviral signaling pathways and the production of antiviral factors such as interferons and interferon-stimulated genes. However, to create an environment favorable to infection, flaviviruses have evolved mechanisms to dampen these antiviral processes, notably through the production of a specific vRNA degradation product termed subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA). In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the fates of flavivirus vRNA and how this is regulated at the molecular level to achieve an optimal replication within infected cells.

TI  - The Neurobiology of Zika Virus: New Models, New Challenges
JF  - Frontiers in Neuroscience
VL  - 15
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) attracted attention due to one striking characteristic: the ability to cross the placental barrier and infect the fetus, possibly causing severe neurodevelopmental disruptions included in the Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). Few years after the epidemic, the CZS incidence has begun to decline. However, how ZIKV causes a diversity of outcomes is far from being understood. This is probably driven by a chain of complex events that relies on the interaction between ZIKV and environmental and physiological variables. In this review, we address open questions that might lead to an ill-defined diagnosis of CZS. This inaccuracy underestimates a large spectrum of apparent normocephalic cases that remain underdiagnosed, comprising several subtle brain abnormalities frequently masked by a normal head circumference. Therefore, new models using neuroimaging and artificial intelligence are needed to improve our understanding of the neurobiology of ZIKV and its true impact in neurodevelopment.

TI  - The New High Resolution Crystal Structure of NS2B-NS3 Protease of Zika Virus
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 9
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is the cause of a significant viral disease affecting humans, which has spread throughout many South American countries and has also become a threat to Southeastern Asia. This commentary discusses the article “Crystal structure of unlinked NS2B-NS3 protease from Zika virus” published recently in the journal Science by Zhang et al. of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. They resolved a 1.58 Å resolution structure of the NS2B-NS3 protease of ZIKV and demonstrated how peptide and non-peptide inhibitors interact with this structure, along with the different conformational states that were observed. This protease crystal structure offers new opportunities for the design and development of novel antiviral drugs used for the treatment and control of ZIKV.

TI  - The Nonstructural Proteins 3 and 5 from Flavivirus Modulate Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Transport and Innate Immune Response Targeting Nuclear Proteins
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Viruses hijack cellular proteins and components to be replicated in the host cell and to evade the immune response. Although flaviviruses have a cytoplasmic replicative cycle, some viral proteins such as the capsid (C) and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, NS5, can reach the nucleus of the infected cells. Considering the important roles of NS5 in viral replication and in the control of the immune response, and its striking presence in the nucleus, the possible functions of this protein in some mechanisms orchestrated by the nucleus was analyzed. We isolated and identified nuclear proteins that interact with NS5; one of them, the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 is relocated to the cytoplasm and degraded during infection with DENV, which correlates with its function in IFN dependent response. Since DDX5 and many other proteins are relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during flavivirus infection, the integrity and function of the main regulator of the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, the nuclear pore complex (NPC) was evaluated. We found that during DENV and ZIKV infection nucleoporins (NUPs) such as TPR, Nup153, Nup98, and Nup62 were cleavaged/degraded. The protease NS2B-NS3 induces NUPs degradation and it causes a dramatic inhibition of mature mRNAs export to the cytoplasm but not the export of DDX5 protein, which is dependent on NS5. Here we describe for the first time that the NS3 and NS5 proteins from flavivirus play novel functions hijacking the NPC and some nuclear proteins relevant in triggering immune response pathways, inducing a favorable environment for viral replication. IMPORTANCE Viruses, as intracellular obligate parasites, hijack cellular components to enter and replicate in infected cells. Remarkably, in many cases, viruses hijack molecules with crucial functions for the cells. Here it is described how RNA viruses such as DENV and ZIKV, with a cytoplasmic replicative cycle, use NS3 and NS5, two of their unique non-structural proteins with enzymatic activity, to modulate nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. We found that NS3 disrupts the nuclear pore complex, the main regulator in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, causing a strong reduction in the amount of mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm and an inhibition in innate immune response. Additionally, NS5 induces the relocation of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm such as DDX5, involved in immune response, which is later degraded by NS3. These findings allow the understanding of crucial mechanisms that viruses use to deal with the control of the immune response to grant the production of new viral particles.

TI  - The NS1 protein of contemporary West African Zika virus potentiates viral replication and reduces innate immune activation
JF  - PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 18
AB  - Mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) from sub-Saharan Africa has recently gained attention due to its epidemic potential and its capacity to be highly teratogenic. To improve our knowledge on currently circulating strains of African ZIKV, we conducted protein sequence alignment and identified contemporary West Africa NS1 (NS1CWA) protein as a highly conserved viral protein. Comparison of NS1CWA with the NS1 of the historical African ZIKV strain MR766 (NS1MR766), revealed seven amino acid substitutions. The effects of NS1 mutations on protein expression, virus replication, and innate immune activation were assessed in human cells using recombinant NS1 proteins and a chimeric viral clone MR766 with NS1CWA replacing NS1MR766. Our data indicated higher secretion efficiency of NS1CWA compared to NS1MR766 associated with a change in subcellular distribution. A chimeric MR766 virus with NS1CWA instead of authentic protein displayed a greater viral replication efficiency, leading to more pronounced cell death compared to parental virus. Enhanced viral growth was associated with reduced activation of innate immunity. Our data raise questions of the importance of NS1 protein in the pathogenicity of contemporary ZIKV from sub-Saharan Africa and point to differences within viral strains of African lineage.

TI  - The NS2B-PP1α-eIF2α axis: Inhibiting stress granule formation and Boosting Zika virus replication
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 20
AB  - Stress granules (SGs), formed by untranslated messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) during cellular stress in eukaryotes, have been linked to flavivirus interference without clear understanding. This study reveals the role of Zika virus (ZIKV) NS2B as a scaffold protein mediating interaction between protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). This interaction promotes eIF2α dephosphorylation by PP1α, inhibiting SG formation. The NS2B-PP1α complex exhibits remarkable stability, resisting ubiquitin-induced degradation and amplifying eIF2α dephosphorylation, thus promoting ZIKV replication. In contrast, the NS2BV35A mutant, interacting exclusively with eIF2α, fails to inhibit SG formation, resulting in reduced viral replication and diminished impact on brain organoid growth. These findings reveal PP1α’s dual role in ZIKV infection, inducing interferon production as an antiviral factor and suppressing SG formation as a viral promoter. Moreover, we found that NS2B also serves as a versatile mechanism employed by flaviviruses to counter host antiviral defenses, primarily by broadly inhibiting SG formation. This research advances our comprehension of the complex interplay in flavivirus-host interactions, offering potential for innovative therapeutic strategies against flavivirus infections.

TI  - The Nuclear Pore Complex: A Target for NS3 Protease of Dengue and Zika Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - During flavivirus infection, some viral proteins move to the nucleus and cellular components are relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Thus, the integrity of the main regulator of the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, the nuclear pore complex (NPC), was evaluated during infection with dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). We found that while during DENV infection the integrity and distribution of at least three nucleoporins (Nup), Nup153, Nup98, and Nup62 were altered, during ZIKV infection, the integrity of TPR, Nup153, and Nup98 were modified. In this work, several lines of evidence indicate that the viral serine protease NS2B3 is involved in Nups cleavage. First, the serine protease inhibitors, TLCK and Leupeptin, prevented Nup98 and Nup62 cleavage. Second, the transfection of DENV and ZIKV NS2B3 protease was sufficient to inhibit the nuclear ring recognition detected in mock-infected cells with the Mab414 antibody. Third, the mutant but not the active (WT) protease was unable to cleave Nups in transfected cells. Thus, here we describe for the first time that the NS3 protein from flavivirus plays novel functions hijacking the nuclear pore complex, the main controller of the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport.

TI  - The Potential Role of the ZIKV NS5 Nuclear Spherical-Shell Structures in Cell Type-Specific Host Immune Modulation during ZIKV Infection
JF  - Cells
VL  - 8
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) non-structural protein 5 (NS5) plays multiple viral and cellular roles during infection, with its primary role in virus RNA replication taking place in the cytoplasm. However, immunofluorescence assay studies have detected the presence of ZIKV NS5 in unique spherical shell-like structures in the nuclei of infected cells, suggesting potentially important cellular roles of ZIKV NS5 in the nucleus. Hence ZIKV NS5′s subcellular distribution and localization must be tightly regulated during ZIKV infection. Both ZIKV NS5 expression or ZIKV infection antagonizes type I interferon signaling, and induces a pro-inflammatory transcriptional response in a cell type-specific manner, but the mechanisms involved and the role of nuclear ZIKV NS5 in these cellular functions has not been elucidated. Intriguingly, these cells originate from the brain and placenta, which are also organs that exhibit a pro-inflammatory signature and are known sites of pathogenesis during ZIKV infection in animal models and humans. Here, we discuss the regulation of the subcellular localization of the ZIKV NS5 protein, and its putative role in the induction of an inflammatory response and the occurrence of pathology in specific organs during ZIKV infection.

TI  - The Raf kinase inhibitors Dabrafenib and Regorafenib impair Zika virus replication via distinct mechanisms
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 98
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that has been associated with congenital neurological defects in fetuses born to infected mothers. At present, no vaccine or antiviral therapy is available to combat this devastating disease. Repurposing drugs that target essential host factors exploited by viruses is an attractive therapeutic approach. Here, we screened a panel of clinically approved small-molecule kinase inhibitors for their antiviral effects against a clinical isolate of ZIKV and thoroughly characterized their mechanisms of action. We found that the Raf kinase inhibitors Dabrafenib and Regorafenib potently impair the replication of ZIKV, but not that of its close relative dengue virus. Time-of-addition experiments showed that both inhibitors target ZIKV infection at post-entry steps. We found that Dabrafenib, but not Regorafenib, interfered with ZIKV genome replication by impairing both negative- and positive-strand RNA synthesis. Regorafenib, on the other hand, altered steady-state viral protein levels, viral egress, and blocked NS1 secretion. We also observed Regorafenib-induced ER fragmentation in ZIKV-infected cells, which might contribute to its antiviral effects. Because these inhibitors target different steps of the ZIKV infection cycle, their use in combination therapy may amplify their antiviral effects which could be further explored for future therapeutic strategies against ZIKV and possibly other flaviviruses. IMPORTANCE There is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics against re-emerging arboviruses associated with neurological disorders like Zika virus (ZIKV). We identified two FDA-approved kinase inhibitors, Dabrafenib and Regorafenib, as potent inhibitors of contemporary ZIKV strains at distinct stages of infection despite overlapping host targets. Both inhibitors reduced viral titers by ~1 to 2 log10 (~10-fold to 100-fold) with minimal cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we show that Dabrafenib inhibits ZIKV RNA replication whereas Regorafenib inhibits ZIKV translation and egress. Regorafenib has the added benefit of limiting NS1 secretion, which contributes to the pathogenesis and disease progression of several flaviviruses. Because these inhibitors affect distinct post-entry steps of ZIKV infection, their therapeutic potential may be amplified by combination therapy and likely does not require prophylactic administration. This study provides further insight into ZIKV-host interactions and has implications for the development of novel antivirals against ZIKV and possibly other flaviviruses.

VL  - 293

EP  - 9063
AB  - Production and degradation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are extensively regulated to ensure proper cellular responses to various environmental stimuli and stresses. Moreover, physiologically generated ROS function as secondary messengers that can influence tissue homeostasis. The cap'n'collar transcription factor known as nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor 2 (Nrf2) coordinates an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional activation pathway that mediates antioxidant and detoxification responses in many animal species, including insects and mammals. Here, we show that Nrf2-mediated signaling affects embryo survival, midgut homeostasis, and redox biology in Aedes aegypti, a mosquito species vector of dengue, Zika, and other disease-causing viruses. We observed that AeNrf2 silencing increases ROS levels and stimulates intestinal stem cell proliferation. Because ROS production is a major aspect of innate immunity in mosquito gut, we found that a decrease in Nrf2 signaling results in reduced microbiota growth and Zika virus infection. Moreover, we provide evidence that AeNrf2 signaling also controls transcriptional adaptation of A. aegypti to insecticide challenge. Therefore, we conclude that Nrf2-mediated response regulates assorted gene clusters in A. aegypti that determine cellular and midgut redox balance, affecting overall xenobiotic resistance and vectorial adaptation of the mosquito.

TI  - The Regulation of Flavivirus Infection by Hijacking Exosome-Mediated Cell–Cell Communication: New Insights on Virus–Host Interactions
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - The arthropod-borne flaviviruses are important human pathogens, and a deeper understanding of the virus–host cell interaction is required to identify cellular targets that can be used as therapeutic candidates. It is well reported that the flaviviruses hijack several cellular functions, such as exosome-mediated cell communication during infection, which is modulated by the delivery of the exosomal cargo of pro- or antiviral molecules to the receiving host cells. Therefore, to study the role of exosomes during flavivirus infections is essential, not only to understand its relevance in virus–host interaction, but also to identify molecular factors that may contribute to the development of new strategies to block these viral infections. This review explores the implications of exosomes in flavivirus dissemination and transmission from the vector to human host cells, as well as their involvement in the host immune response. The hypothesis about exosomes as a transplacental infection route of ZIKV and the paradox effect or the dual role of exosomes released during flavivirus infection are also discussed here. Although several studies have been performed in order to identify and characterize cellular and viral molecules released in exosomes, it is not clear how all of these components participate in viral pathogenesis. Further studies will determine the balance between protective and harmful exosomes secreted by flavivirus infected cells, the characteristics and components that distinguish them both, and how they could be a factor that determines the infection outcome.

TI  - The RNA polymerase of cytoplasmically replicating Zika virus binds with chromatin DNA in nuclei and regulates host gene transcription
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 119
AB  - Significance All positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), replicate in the cytoplasm of host cells, but they can regulate host gene expression in the nucleus. Here, we report that the ZIKV NS5, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and essential for the viral replication in the cytoplasm, can directly bind with chromatin DNA in the nuclei. In human neural progenitor cells, NS5 inhibits the transcription of numerous neural genes by binding onto their gene body and blocking PAF1C-mediated transcription elongation. The expression of ZIKV NS5 disrupts neurogenesis in developing mouse brain. Our findings reveal a role of ZIKV RdRp as a DNA binding protein to regulate host gene transcription and provide insights into abnormal neurodevelopment and ZIKV infection.

TI  - The RNAi pathway plays a small part in Wolbachia-mediated blocking of dengue virus in mosquito cells
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Wolbachia pipientis is an insect endosymbiont known to limit the replication of viruses including dengue and Zika in their primary mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. Wolbachia is being released into mosquito populations globally in a bid to control the diseases caused by these viruses. It is theorized that Wolbachia’s priming of the insect immune system may confer protection against subsequent viral infection. Other hypotheses posit a role for competition between Wolbachia and viruses for host cellular resources. Using an A. aegypti cell line infected with Wolbachia, we tested the effects of targeting siRNAs against the major innate immune pathways on dengue virus loads. We show that while Wolbachia infection induces genes in the Toll, JAK/STAT and RNAi pathways, only reduced expression of RNAi leads to a rebound of dengue virus loads in Wolbachia-infected cells. The magnitude of the effect explained less than 10% of the total DENV load, demonstrating that blocking must be dependent on other factors in addition to the expression of RNAi. The findings bode well for the long-term stability of blocking given that immunity gene expression would likely be highly plastic and susceptible to rapid evolution.

TI  - The Robust Restriction of Zika Virus by Type-I Interferon in A549 Cells Varies by Viral Lineage and Is Not Determined by IFITM3
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Type-I interferon (IFN-I) is a major antiviral host response but its impact on Zika virus (ZIKV) replication is not well defined, particularly as it relates to different circulating strains. Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that inhibit ZIKV, such as IFITM3, have been identified largely using overexpression studies. Here, we tested whether diverse ZIKV strains differed in their susceptibility to IFN-I-mediated restriction and the contribution of IFITM3 to this restriction. We identified a robust IFN-I-mediated antiviral effect on ZIKV replication (>100-fold reduction) in A549 cells, a commonly used cell line to study ZIKV replication. The extent of inhibition depended on the IFN-I type and the virus strain tested. Viruses from the American pathogenic outbreak were more sensitive to IFNα (p = 0.049) and IFNβ (p = 0.09) than African-lineage strains, which have not been linked to severe pathogenesis. Knocking out IFITM3 expression did not dampen the IFN-I antiviral effect and only high overexpression of IFITM3 led to ZIKV inhibition. Moreover, IFITM3 expression levels in different cells were not associated with IFN-mediated ZIKV inhibition. Taken together, our findings indicate that there is a robust IFN-I-mediated antiviral effect on ZIKV infection, particularly for American viruses, that is not due to IFITM3. A549 cells, which are a commonly used cell line to study ZIKV replication, present an opportunity for the discovery of novel antiviral ISGs against ZIKV.

TI  - The role of glial cells in Zika virus‐induced neurodegeneration
JF  - Glia
VL  - 71
SP  - 1791
EP  - 1803
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a strongly neurotropic flavivirus whose infection has been associated with microcephaly in neonates. However, clinical and experimental evidence indicate that ZIKV also affects the adult nervous system. In this regard, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown the ability of ZIKV to infect glial cells. In the central nervous system (CNS), glial cells are represented by astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. In contrast, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) constitutes a highly heterogeneous group of cells (Schwann cells, satellite glial cells, and enteric glial cells) spread through the body. These cells are critical in both physiological and pathological conditions; as such, ZIKV‐induced glial dysfunctions can be associated with the development and progression of neurological complications, including those related to the adult and aging brain. This review will address the effects of ZIKV infection on CNS and PNS glial cells, focusing on cellular and molecular mechanisms, including changes in the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, Ca2+ and glutamate homeostasis, neural metabolism, and neuron–glia communication. Of note, preventive and therapeutic strategies that focus on glial cells may emerge to delay and/or prevent the development of ZIKV‐induced neurodegeneration and its consequences.

TI  - The Role of Noncoding RNA in the Transmission and Pathogenicity of Flaviviruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute a class of RNA molecules that lack protein-coding capacity. ncRNAs frequently modulate gene expression through specific interactions with target proteins or messenger RNAs, thereby playing integral roles in a wide array of cellular processes. The Flavivirus genus comprises several significant members, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and yellow fever virus (YFV), which have caused global outbreaks, resulting in high morbidity and mortality in human populations. The life cycle of arthropod-borne flaviviruses encompasses their transmission between hematophagous insect vectors and mammalian hosts. During this process, a complex three-way interplay occurs among the pathogen, vector, and host, with ncRNAs exerting a critical regulatory influence. ncRNAs not only constitute a crucial regulatory mechanism that has emerged from the coevolution of viruses and their hosts but also hold potential as antiviral targets for controlling flavivirus epidemics. This review introduces the biogenesis of flavivirus-derived ncRNAs and summarizes the regulatory roles of ncRNAs in viral replication, vector-mediated viral transmission, antiviral innate immunity, and viral pathogenicity. A profound comprehension of the interplay between ncRNAs and flaviviruses will help formulate efficacious prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against flavivirus-related diseases.

TI  - The Role of Secretory Autophagy in Zika Virus Transfer through the Placental Barrier
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 6
AB  - Recent studies indicated that the Zika virus genome could be detected in the amniotic fluid and the fetal brain, which confirms that the virus can cross the placental barrier. Secretory autophagy or exosome pathways may participate in this virus transfer. Autophagy modulators regulate autophagosome formation or membrane fusion with lysosomal vesicles and therefore inhibit viral nucleocapsid releasing or virus transfer to the fetus hypothetically. However, some autophagy modulators may enhance virus replication. Autophagy inhibitors may arrest placental development; while exaggeration of autophagy in human placenta may be associated with the fetal growth restriction. Therefore, autophagy modulators should be used carefully due to their complex clinical effects. Alternatively, exosome-specific inhibitors might be also considered, although their safety of both maternal and fetal conditions must be carefully assessed before any advancement to human clinical trials.

TI  - The Role of the Host Ubiquitin System in Promoting Replication of Emergent Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Ubiquitination of proteins is a post-translational modification process with many different cellular functions, including protein stability, immune signaling, antiviral functions and virus replication. While ubiquitination of viral proteins can be used by the host as a defense mechanism by destroying the incoming pathogen, viruses have adapted to take advantage of this cellular process. The ubiquitin system can be hijacked by viruses to enhance various steps of the replication cycle and increase pathogenesis. Emerging viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), flaviviruses like Zika and dengue, as well as highly pathogenic viruses like Ebola and Nipah, have the ability to directly use the ubiquitination process to enhance their viral-replication cycle, and evade immune responses. Some of these mechanisms are conserved among different virus families, especially early during virus entry, providing an opportunity to develop broad-spectrum antivirals. Here, we discuss the mechanisms used by emergent viruses to exploit the host ubiquitin system, with the main focus on the role of ubiquitin in enhancing virus replication.

TI  - The Role of TIM-1 and CD300a in Zika Virus Infection Investigated with Cell-Based Electrical Impedance
JF  - Biosensors
VL  - 14
AB  - Orthoflaviviruses cause a major threat to global public health, and no antiviral treatment is available yet. Zika virus (ZIKV) entry, together with many other viruses, is known to be enhanced by phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors such as T-cell immunoglobulin mucin domain protein 1 (TIM-1). In this study, we demonstrate for the first time, using cell-based electrical impedance (CEI) biosensing, that ZIKV entry is also enhanced by expression of CD300a, another PS receptor. Furthermore, inhibiting CD300a in immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells partially but significantly inhibits ZIKV replication. As we have previously demonstrated that CEI is a useful tool to study Orthoflavivirus infection in real time, we now use this technology to determine how these PS receptors influence the kinetics of in vitro ZIKV infection. Results show that ZIKV entry is highly sensitive to minor changes in TIM-1 expression, both after overexpression of TIM-1 in infection-resistant HEK293T cells, as well as after partial knockout of TIM-1 in susceptible A549 cells. These results are confirmed by quantification of viral copy number and viral infectivity, demonstrating that CEI is highly suited to study and compare virus-host interactions. Overall, the results presented here demonstrate the potential of targeting this universal viral entry pathway.

TI  - The secretory fate of flavivirus NS1 in mosquito cells is influenced by the caveolin binding domain
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Flaviviruses of major medical importance worldwide such as dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and yellow fever (YFV) viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes Aedes sp. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of these flaviviruses is secreted from the infected cells using different secretion routes depending on the cell and virus nature. The NS1 of DENV and ZIKV contain in the hydrophobic region a conserved caveolin binding domain (CBD) (ΦXXΦXXXXΦ), which is not conserved in YFV NS1. To ascertain the role of the CBD in the secretory route followed by flavivirus NS1, expression vectors for the NS1 of DENV2, ZIKV and YFV were constructed. Using site-directed mutagenesis, substitutions were made in the aromatic residues within CBD; in addition, the full domain was replaced by those of other flaviviruses, creating chimeras in the CBD of NS1. Substitutions of the aromatic residues to Ala or Thr, or CBD chimeras, results in increased sensitivity of NS1 secretion to brefeldin A treatment, indicating a change to a classical secretion pathway. Likewise, the insertion of the DENV/ZIKV CBD into the recombinant Gaussia-Luciferase results in a loss of sensitivity to BFA treatment, in luciferase secretion. These results suggest that the CBD sequence is a molecular determinant for the unconventional secretory route followed by DENV and ZIKV NS1 in mosquito cells. However, the cellular components that recognize the CBD in the NS1 of DENV and ZIKV and redirect them to an unconventional route and if this secretion route confers unique functions to NS1 within the vector mosquito are aspects currently unknown. Importance Flaviviruses are an important cause of mosquito borne diseases to humans. We have previously demonstrated that the non-structural protein 1 from dengue and zika virus are secreted efficiently from mosquito cells using an unconventional route, that depends on caveolin and molecular chaperones. In this work, we show evidence indicating that a caveolin binding domain, well conserved and exposed in dengue and Zika virus NS1, but absent in other flaviviruses such as yellow fever virus or West Nile virus, is important in determining the unconventional secretion pathway followed by dengue and zika virus NS1 in mosquito cells. The unique secretory pathway followed by NS1 in mosquito cells may result in distinctive viral-cellular protein associations required to facilitate viral infection in the mosquito vector. To identify viral and cellular elements that could disturb the traffic of dengue and Zika virus NS1 may be important to design of strategies for vector control.

JF  - Oncotarget
VL  - 9
SP  - 3160
EP  - 3171
AB  - Zika virus, a flavivirus like Dengue and West Nile viruses, poses a significant risk as a pathogen in the category of emerging infectious diseases. Zika infections typically cause nonspecific, mild symptoms, but can also manifest as a neurological disorder like Guillain-Barre syndrome. Infection in pregnant women is linked to microcephaly in newborn infants. The methyltransferase domain of the non-structural protein 5 is responsible for two sequential methylations of the 5'-RNA cap. This is crucial for genome stability, efficient translation, and escape from the host immune response. Here we present the crystal structures of the Zika methyltransferase domain in complex with the methyl-donor SAM and its by-product SAH. The methyltransferase-SAH binary complex presents a new conformation of a "closed" or "obstructed" state that would restrict the binding of new RNA for capping. The combination and comparison of our new structures with recently published Zika methyltransferase structures provide a first glimpse into the structural mechanism of Zika virus mRNA capping.

AB  - The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) has imposed a serious threat to public health. Here we report the crystal structure of the ZIKV NS5 protein in complex with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, in which the tandem methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains stack into one of the two alternative conformations of flavivirus NS5 proteins. The activity of this NS5 protein is verified through a de novo RdRp assay on a subgenomic ZIKV RNA template. Importantly, our structural analysis leads to the identification of a potential drug-binding site of ZIKV NS5, which might facilitate the development of novel antivirals for ZIKV. The recent outbreak of Zika virus is a major worldwide health concern and effective drugs are currently not available. Here the authors present the structure of Zika non-structural protein 5 and identify a potential drug-binding site, which might facilitate the development of novel antivirals.

TI  - The subgenomic flaviviral RNA suppresses RNA interference through competing with siRNAs for binding RISC components
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 98
AB  - ABSTRACT During the life cycle of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, substantial subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) is produced via incomplete degradation of viral genomic RNA by host XRN1. Zika virus (ZIKV) sfRNA has been detected in mosquito and mammalian somatic cells. Human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) in the developing brain are the major target cells of ZIKV, and antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) plays a critical role in hNPCs. However, whether ZIKV sfRNA was produced in ZIKV-infected hNPCs as well as its function remains not known. In this study, we demonstrate that abundant sfRNA was produced in ZIKV-infected hNPCs. RNA pulldown and mass spectrum assays showed ZIKV sfRNA interacted with host proteins RHA and PACT, both of which are RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) components. Functionally, ZIKV sfRNA can antagonize RNAi by outcompeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in binding to RHA and PACT. Furthermore, the 3′ stem loop (3′SL) of sfRNA was responsible for RISC components binding and RNAi inhibition, and 3′SL can enhance the replication of a viral suppressor of RNAi (VSR)-deficient virus in a RHA- and PACT-dependent manner. More importantly, the ability of binding to RISC components is conversed among multiple flaviviral 3′SLs. Together, our results identified flavivirus 3′SL as a potent VSR in RNA format, highlighting the complexity in virus-host interaction during flavivirus infection. IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) infection mainly targets human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) and induces cell death and dysregulated cell-cycle progression, leading to microcephaly and other central nervous system abnormalities. RNA interference (RNAi) plays critical roles during ZIKV infections in hNPCs, and ZIKV has evolved to encode specific viral proteins to antagonize RNAi. Herein, we first show that abundant sfRNA was produced in ZIKV-infected hNPCs in a similar pattern to that in other cells. Importantly, ZIKV sfRNA acts as a potent viral suppressor of RNAi (VSR) by competing with siRNAs for binding RISC components, RHA and PACT. The 3′SL of sfRNA is responsible for binding RISC components, which is a conserved feature among mosquito-borne flaviviruses. As most known VSRs are viral proteins, our findings highlight the importance of viral non-coding RNAs during the antagonism of host RNAi-based antiviral innate immunity.

TI  - The SUMOylation pathway suppresses arbovirus replication in Aedes aegypti cells
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - Mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of many clinically important arboviruses that cause significant levels of annual mortality and socioeconomic health burden worldwide. Deciphering the mechanisms by which mosquitoes modulate arbovirus infection is crucial to understand how viral-host interactions promote vector transmission and human disease. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification that leads to the covalent attachment of the Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) protein to host factors, which in turn can modulate their stability, interaction networks, sub-cellular localisation, and biochemical function. While the SUMOylation pathway is known to play a key role in the regulation of host immune defences to virus infection in humans, the importance of this pathway during arbovirus infection in mosquito vectors, such as Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti), remains unknown. Here we characterise the sequence, structure, biochemical properties, and tissue-specific expression profiles of component proteins of the Ae. aegypti SUMOylation pathway. We demonstrate significant biochemical differences between Ae. aegypti and Homo sapiens SUMOylation pathways and identify cell-type specific patterns of SUMO expression in Ae. aegypti tissues known to support arbovirus replication. Importantly, depletion of core SUMOylation effector proteins (SUMO, Ubc9 and PIAS) in Ae. aegypti cells led to enhanced levels of arbovirus replication from three different families; Zika (Flaviviridae), Semliki Forest (Togaviridae), and Bunyamwera (Bunyaviridae) viruses. Our findings identify an important role for mosquito SUMOylation in the cellular restriction of arboviruses that may directly influence vector competence and transmission of clinically important arboviruses.

AB  - Background Many viruses enter host cells by hijacking endosomal trafficking. CapZ, a canonical actin capping protein, participates in endosomal trafficking, yet its precise role in endocytosis and virus infection remains elusive. Results Here, we showed that CapZ was transiently associated with early endosomes (EEs) and was subsequently released from the matured EEs after the fusion of two EEs, which was facilitated by PI(3)P to PI(3,5)P2 conversion. Vacuolin-1 (a triazine compound) stabilized CapZ at EEs and thus blocked the transition of EEs to late endosomes (LEs). Likewise, artificially tethering CapZ to EEs via a rapamycin-induced protein–protein interaction system blocked the early-to-late endosome transition. Remarkably, CapZ knockout or artificially tethering CapZ to EEs via rapamycin significantly inhibited flaviviruses, e.g., Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV), or beta-coronavirus, e.g., murine hepatitis virus (MHV), infection by preventing the escape of RNA genome from endocytic vesicles. Conclusions These results indicate that the temporal association of CapZ with EEs facilitates early-to-late endosome transition (physiologically) and the release of the viral genome from endocytic vesicles (pathologically).

TI  - The Unfolded Protein Response: A Key Player in Zika Virus-Associated Congenital Microcephaly
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family, together with dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. In the wake of its emergence in the French Polynesia and in the Americas, ZIKV has been shown to cause congenital microcephaly. It is the first arbovirus which has been proven to be teratogenic and sexually transmissible. Confronted with this major public health challenge, the scientific and medical communities teamed up to precisely characterize the clinical features of congenital ZIKV syndrome and its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This review focuses on the critical impact of the unfolded protein response (UPR) on ZIKV-associated congenital microcephaly. ZIKV infection of cortical neuron progenitors leads to high endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This results in both the stalling of indirect neurogenesis, and UPR-dependent neuronal apoptotic death, and leads to cortical microcephaly. In line with these results, the administration of molecules inhibiting UPR prevents ZIKV-induced cortical microcephaly. The discovery of the link between ZIKV infection and UPR activation has a broader relevance, since this pathway plays a crucial role in many distinct cellular processes and its induction by ZIKV may account for several reported ZIKV-associated defects.

TI  - The Unique Cofactor Region of Zika Virus NS2B-NS3 Protease Facilitates Cleavage of Key Host Proteins.
JF  - ACS chemical biology
VL  - 13 9
SP  - 2398
EP  - 2405
AB  - Zika virus is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen capable of severely damaging developing fetuses as well as causing neurological abnormalities in adults. The molecular details of how Zika virus causes pathologies that are unique among the flavivirus family remain poorly understood and have contributed to the lack of Zika antiviral therapies. To elucidate how Zika virus protease (ZVP) affects host cellular pathways and consequent pathologies, we used unbiased N-terminomics to identify 31 human proteins cleaved by the NS2B-NS3 protease. In particular, autophagy-related protein 16-1 (ATG16L1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 1 (eIF4G1) are dramatically depleted during Zika virus infection. ATG16L1 and eIF4G1 mediate type-II interferon production and host-cell translation, respectively, likely aiding immune system evasion and driving the Zika life cycle. Intriguingly, the NS2B cofactor region from Zika virus protease is essential for recognition of host cell substrates. Replacing the NS2B region in another flavivirus protease enabled recognition of novel Zika-specific substrates by hybrid proteases, suggesting that the cofactor is the principal determinant in ZVP substrate selection.

TI  - The ZIKA Virus Delays Cell Death Through the Anti-Apoptotic Bcl-2 Family Proteins
JF  - Cells
VL  - 8
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging human mosquito-transmitted pathogen of global concern, known to be associated with complications such as congenital defects and neurological disorders in adults. ZIKV infection is associated with induction of cell death. However, previous studies suggest that the virally induced apoptosis occurs at a slower rate compared to the course of viral production. In this present study, we investigated the capacity of ZIKV to delay host cell apoptosis. We provide evidence that ZIKV has the ability to interfere with apoptosis whether it is intrinsically or extrinsically induced. In cells expressing viral replicon-type constructions, we show that this control is achieved through replication. Finally, our work highlights an important role for anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein in the ability of ZIKV to control apoptotic pathways, avoiding premature cell death and thereby promoting virus replication in the host-cell.

TI  - The ZIKV NS5 Protein Aberrantly Alters the Tubulin Cytoskeleton, Induces the Accumulation of Autophagic p62 and Affects IFN Production: HDAC6 Has Emerged as an Anti-NS5/ZIKV Factor
JF  - Cells
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and pathogenesis are linked to the disruption of neurogenesis, congenital Zika syndrome and microcephaly by affecting neural progenitor cells. Nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is the largest product encoded by ZIKV-RNA and is important for replication and immune evasion. Here, we studied the potential effects of NS5 on microtubules (MTs) and autophagy flux, together with the interplay of NS5 with histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Fluorescence microscopy, biochemical cell-fractionation combined with the use of HDAC6 mutants, chemical inhibitors and RNA interference indicated that NS5 accumulates in nuclear structures and strongly promotes the acetylation of MTs that aberrantly reorganize in nested structures. Similarly, NS5 accumulates the p62 protein, an autophagic-flux marker. Therefore, NS5 alters events that are under the control of the autophagic tubulin-deacetylase HDAC6. HDAC6 appears to degrade NS5 by autophagy in a deacetylase- and BUZ domain-dependent manner and to control the cytoplasmic expression of NS5. Moreover, NS5 inhibits RNA-mediated RIG-I interferon (IFN) production, resulting in greater activity when autophagy is inhibited (i.e., effect correlated with NS5 stability). Therefore, it is conceivable that NS5 contributes to cell toxicity and pathogenesis, evading the IFN-immune response by overcoming HDAC6 functions. HDAC6 has emerged as an anti-ZIKV factor by targeting NS5.

TI  - TLR3 Activation by Zika Virus Stimulates Inflammatory Cytokine Production Which Dampens the Antiviral Response Induced by RIG-I-Like Receptors
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has a pronounced neurotropism, and infections with this virus can cause serious neurological disorders, most notably microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Our studies reveal that during ZIKV infection, recognition of viral RNA by TLR3 enhances the production of inflammatory cytokines and suppresses the interferon response triggered by RIG-I-like receptors (RLR) in a SOCS3-dependent manner, thus facilitating virus replication. ABSTRACT Infection with the Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, can cause serious neurological disorders, most notably microcephaly in newborns. In this study, we investigated the innate immune response to ZIKV infection in cells of the nervous system. In human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), a target for ZIKV infection and likely involved in ZIKV-associated neuropathology, viral infection failed to elicit an antiviral interferon (IFN) response. However, pharmacological inhibition of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) partially restored this deficit. Analogous results were obtained in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes, which are capable of mounting a strong antiviral cytokine response. There, ZIKV is sensed by both RIG-I and MDA5 and induces an IFN response as well as expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). Upon inhibition of TLR3, also in astrocytes the antiviral cytokine response was enhanced, whereas amounts of proinflammatory cytokines were reduced. To study the underlying mechanism, we used human epithelial cells as an easy-to-manipulate model system. We found that ZIKV is sensed in these cells by RIG-I to induce a robust IFN response and by TLR3 to trigger the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6. ZIKV-induced upregulation of IL-6 activated the STAT3 pathway, which decreased STAT1 phosphorylation in a SOCS3-dependent manner, thus reducing the IFN response. In conclusion, we show that TLR3 activation by ZIKV suppresses IFN responses triggered by RIG-I-like receptors (RLR). IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) has a pronounced neurotropism, and infections with this virus can cause serious neurological disorders, most notably microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Our studies reveal that during ZIKV infection, recognition of viral RNA by TLR3 enhances the production of inflammatory cytokines and suppresses the interferon response triggered by RIG-I-like receptors (RLR) in a SOCS3-dependent manner, thus facilitating virus replication. The discovery of this cross talk between antiviral (RLR) and inflammatory (TLR) responses may have important implications for our understanding of ZIKV-induced pathogenesis.

TI  - Toll-like receptor 3 regulates Zika virus infection and associated host inflammatory response in primary human astrocytes
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 14
AB  - The connection between Zika virus (ZIKV) and neurodevelopmental defects is widely recognized, although the mechanisms underlying the infectivity and pathology in primary human glial cells are poorly understood. Here we show that three isolated strains of ZIKV, an African strain MR766 (Uganda) and two closely related Asian strains R103451 (Honduras) and PRVABC59 (Puerto Rico) productively infect primary human astrocytes, although Asian strains showed a higher infectivity rate and increased cell death when compared to the African strain. Inhibition of AXL receptor significantly attenuated viral entry of MR766 and PRVABC59 and to a lesser extend R103451, suggesting an important role of TAM receptors in ZIKV cell entry, irrespective of lineage. Infection by PRVABC59 elicited the highest release of inflammatory molecules, with a 8-fold increase in the release of RANTES, 10-fold increase in secretion of IP-10 secretion and a 12-fold increase in IFN-β secretion when compared to un-infected human astrocytes. Minor changes in the release of several growth factors, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress response factors and the transcription factor, NF-κB were detected with the Asian strains, while significant increases in FOXO6, MAPK10 and JNK were detected with the African strain. Activation of the autophagy pathway was evident with increased expression of the autophagy related proteins Beclin1, LC3B and p62/SQSTM1 with all three strains of ZIKV. Pharmacological inhibition of the autophagy pathway and genetic inhibition of the Beclin1 showed minimal effects on ZIKV replication. The expression of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) was significantly increased with all three strains of ZIKV; pharmacological and genetic inhibition of TLR3 caused a decrease in viral titers and in viral-induced inflammatory response in infected astrocytes. We conclude that TLR3 plays a vital role in both ZIKV replication and viral-induced inflammatory responses, irrespective of the strains, while the autophagy protein Beclin1 influences host inflammatory responses.

TI  - Towards a Universal Translator: Decoding the PTMs That Regulate Orthoflavivirus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 17
AB  - Post-translational modifications (PTMs) serve as critical regulators of protein function across biological systems, including during viral infection. For orthoflaviviruses, including human pathogens like dengue, Zika, and West Nile viruses, PTMs on viral proteins regulate multiple aspects of the viral lifecycle and pathogenesis. Here, we review the mechanisms by which PTMs regulate orthoflavivirus infection in both vertebrate and arthropod hosts. We examine how ubiquitination and glycosylation on the viral envelope proteins facilitate viral entry and how phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and acetylation on non-structural proteins modulate viral RNA replication. Additionally, we describe how PTMs on viral structural proteins dynamically regulate viral assembly and egress. We also describe how PTMs can influence tissue tropism and host-specific pathogenesis, with some modifications showing divergent functions between arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts, and how the host antiviral response can trigger specific PTMs on viral proteins to restrict infection, highlighting PTMs as key mediators of host-pathogen interactions. While significant progress has been made in identifying PTMs on viral proteins, many questions remain about their temporal dynamics, mechanisms of action, and conservation across the orthoflavivirus genus. Understanding how PTMs regulate orthoflavivirus infection may reveal new therapeutic strategies, particularly given recent advances in targeting specific protein modifications for disease treatment.

TI  - Transcriptional Response of Wolbachia to Dengue Virus Infection in Cells of the Mosquito Aedes aegypti
JF  - mSphere
VL  - 6
AB  - Aedes aegypti is a vector of several pathogenic viruses, including dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, which are of importance to human health. Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium currently used in transinfected mosquitoes to suppress replication and transmission of dengue viruses. However, the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus inhibition is not fully understood. ABSTRACT Aedes aegypti transmits one of the most significant mosquito‐borne viruses, dengue virus (DENV). The absence of effective vaccines and clinical treatments and the emergence of insecticide resistance in A. aegypti necessitate novel vector control strategies. A new approach uses the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis to reduce the spread of arboviruses. However, the Wolbachia-mediated antiviral mechanism is not well understood. To shed light on this mechanism, we investigated an unexplored aspect of Wolbachia-virus-mosquito interaction. We used RNA sequencing to examine the transcriptional response of Wolbachia to DENV infection in A. aegypti Aag2 cells transinfected with the wAlbB strain of Wolbachia. Our results suggest that genes encoding an endoribonuclease (RNase HI), a regulator of sigma 70-dependent gene transcription (6S RNA), essential cellular, transmembrane, and stress response functions and primary type I and IV secretion systems were upregulated, while a number of transport and binding proteins of Wolbachia, ribosome structure, and elongation factor-associated genes were downregulated due to DENV infection. Furthermore, bacterial retrotransposon, transposable, and phage-related elements were found among the up- and downregulated genes. We show that Wolbachia elicits a transcriptional response to virus infection and identify differentially expressed Wolbachia genes mostly at the early stages of virus infection. These findings highlight Wolbachia’s ability to alter its gene expression in response to DENV infection of the host cell. IMPORTANCE Aedes aegypti is a vector of several pathogenic viruses, including dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, which are of importance to human health. Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium currently used in transinfected mosquitoes to suppress replication and transmission of dengue viruses. However, the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus inhibition is not fully understood. While several studies have shown mosquitoes’ transcriptional responses to dengue virus infection, none have investigated these responses in Wolbachia, which may provide clues to the inhibition mechanism. Our results suggest changes in the expression of a number of functionally important Wolbachia genes upon dengue virus infection, including those involved in stress responses, providing insights into the endosymbiont’s reaction to virus infection.

TI  - Transcriptome Analysis of Response to Zika Virus Infection in Two Aedes albopictus Strains with Different Vector Competence
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 24
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), which is mainly transmitted by Aedes albopictus in temperate zones, can causes serious neurological disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms that influence the vector competence of Ae. albopictus for ZIKV are poorly understood. In this study, the vector competence of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes from Jinghong (JH) and Guangzhou (GZ) Cities of China were evaluated, and transcripts in the midgut and salivary gland tissues were sequenced on 10 days post-infection. The results showed that both Ae. albopictus JH and GZ strains were susceptible to ZIKV, but the GZ strain was more competent. The categories and functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to ZIKV infection were quite different between tissues and strains. Through a bioinformatics analysis, a total of 59 DEGs that may affect vector competence were screened—among which, cytochrome P450 304a1 (CYP304a1) was the only gene significantly downregulated in both tissues of two strains. However, CYP304a1 did not influence ZIKV infection and replication in Ae. albopictus under the conditions set in this study. Our results demonstrated that the different vector competence of Ae. albopictus for ZIKV may be determined by the transcripts in the midgut and salivary gland, which will contribute to understanding ZIKV–mosquito interactions and develop arbovirus disease prevention strategies.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis of DENV-2-infected human dermal fibroblasts identified potential mechanisms that suppressed ZIKV replication during sequential coinfection
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 22
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are closely related flaviviruses which are transmitted by the same species of mosquitoes. Due to overlapping geographic distributions and transmission vectors, cases of DENV-ZIKV coinfection have been reported. However, the impact of coinfection on disease outcomes remains unclear. In this study, an in vitro model of DENV-ZIKV coinfection was developed using the primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). The interaction between DENV-2 and ZIKV during sequential coinfection revealed that prior DENV-2 infection significantly suppressed ZIKV RNA accumulation in the culture supernatant. Transcriptomic profile in response to DENV-2 infection suggested three hypothetical pathways that potentially interfere with ZIKV replication. The first mechanism is prior DENV infection drove HDFs into an antiviral state through upregulation of genes involving innate immune response pathways, including PRR signaling, type I and type II IFN signaling, ISG activity, and cytokine/chemokine activity. This state significantly enhanced resistance to subsequent ZIKV infection in both infected cells and uninfected neighboring cells. The second potential pathway is inhibition of viral entry. This was supported by DENV-2-infected HDFs significantly suppressed expression of ZIKV receptor and reduced expression of genes involving in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This can interfere with entry of ZIKV into host cells. The last possible mechanism is driving cells into cell cycle arrest, as DENV-2 infection downregulated genes related to cell cycle progression, which may hinder ZIKV replication. These findings partly unfold the interplay between DENV and ZIKV at the entry site which may explain the disease outcome of DENV-ZIKV coinfection.

TI  - Transmembrane protein 2 inhibits Zika virus replication through activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling pathway
JF  - Future Virology
AB  - Aim: TMEM2 has been demonstrated to suppress HBV infection by activating the Jak/STAT pathway. In this study, we sought to explore the mechanism by which TMEM2 effects on Zika virus (ZIKV) replication. Materials & methods: TMEM2 was overexpressed. Selected gene mRNA, p-STAT1 levels and interferon stimulated response element activity were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blot and luciferase assay respectively. Results: Overexpression of TMEM2 significantly inhibited ZIKV replication, upregulated MDA5 and RIG-I expression, increased IFN-β promoter activity and IFN-β expression. Overexpression of TMEM2 enhanced the Jak/STAT signaling including increased p-STAT1 level, ISRE activity as well as the expression of several antiviral interferon-stimulated genes. Conclusion: TMEM2 inhibited ZIKV replication through increased IFN-β production and enhanced activation of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway.

TI  - Transmission of Zika virus by dendritic cell subsets in skin and vaginal mucosa
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 14
AB  - Zika virus is a member of the Flaviviridae family that has caused recent outbreaks associated with neurological malformations. Transmission of Zika virus occurs primarily via mosquito bite but also via sexual contact. Dendritic cells (DCs) and Langerhans cells (LCs) are important antigen presenting cells in skin and vaginal mucosa and paramount to induce antiviral immunity. To date, little is known about the first cells targeted by Zika virus in these tissues as well as subsequent dissemination of the virus to other target cells. We therefore investigated the role of DCs and LCs in Zika virus infection. Human monocyte derived DCs (moDCs) were isolated from blood and primary immature LCs were obtained from human skin and vaginal explants. Zika virus exposure to moDCs but not skin and vaginal LCs induced Type I Interferon responses. Zika virus efficiently infected moDCs but neither epidermal nor vaginal LCs became infected. Infection of a human full skin model showed that DC-SIGN expressing dermal DCs are preferentially infected over langerin+ LCs. Notably, not only moDCs but also skin and vaginal LCs efficiently transmitted Zika virus to target cells. Transmission by LCs was independent of direct infection of LCs. These data suggest that DCs and LCs are among the first target cells for Zika virus not only in the skin but also the genital tract. The role of vaginal LCs in dissemination of Zika virus from the vaginal mucosa further emphasizes the threat of sexual transmission and supports the investigation of prophylaxes that go beyond mosquito control.

TI  - TRiC/CCT Complex, a Binding Partner of NS1 Protein, Supports the Replication of Zika Virus in Both Mammalians and Mosquitoes
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) can cause congenital microcephaly and Guillain–Barré syndrome, among other symptoms. Specific treatments and vaccines for ZIKV are not currently available. To further understand the host factors that support ZIKV replication, we used mass spectrometry to characterize mammalian proteins that associate with the ZIKV NS1 protein and identified the TRiC/CCT complex as an interacting partner. Furthermore, the suppression of CCT2, one of the critical components of the TRiC/CCT complex, inhibited ZIKV replication in both mammalian cells and mosquitoes. These results highlight an important role for the TRiC/CCT complex in ZIKV infection, suggesting that the TRiC/CCT complex may be a promising therapeutic target.

TI  - TRIM22 suppresses Zika virus replication by targeting NS1 and NS3 for proteasomal degradation
JF  - Cell & Bioscience
VL  - 12
AB  - Recognition of viral invasion by innate antiviral immune system triggers activation of the type I interferon (IFN-I) and proinflammatory signaling pathways. Subsequently, IFN-I induction regulates expression of a group of genes known as IFN-I-stimulated genes (ISGs) to block viral infection. The tripartite motif containing 22 (TRIM22) is an ISG with strong antiviral functions. Here we have shown that the TRIM22 has been strongly upregulated both transcriptionally and translationally upon Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. ZIKV infection is associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations in human from mild to severe symptoms including abnormal fetal brain development. We found that the antiviral function of TRIM22 plays a crucial role in counterattacking ZIKV infection. Overexpression of TRIM22 protein inhibited ZIKV growth whereas deletion of TRIM22 in host cells increased ZIKV infectivity. Mechanistically, TRIM22, as a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and nonstructural protein 3 (NS3). Further studies showed that the SPRY domain and Ring domain of TRIM22 played important roles in protein interaction and degradation, respectively. In addition, we found that TRIM22 also inhibited other flaviviruses infection including dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Thus, TRIM22 is an ISG with important role in host defense against flaviviruses through binding and degradation of the NS1 and NS3 proteins.

TI  - TRIM38 Inhibits Zika Virus by Upregulating RIG-I/MDA5 Pathway and Promoting Ubiquitin-Mediated Degradation of Viral NS3 Protein
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 17
AB  - Members of the tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing protein family play crucial roles in regulating immune system responses. The TRIM38 protein regulates host innate immunity and directly degrades some viral proteins through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This study demonstrated that Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can promote the expression of TRIM38 in human glioma cells (U251). TRIM38 overexpression restricted ZIKV replication in U251 cells, while TRIM38 knockout enhanced ZIKV replication. TRIM38 overexpression upregulated the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway and promoted the level of IFN-β early during viral infection, while TRIM38 knockout had the opposite effect. In addition, TRIM38 interacts with ZIKV non-structural protein 3 (NS3) and degrades the NS3 protein through a lysosome-dependent manner via the E3 ligase activity of TRIM38. Deletion of the RING domain of TRIM38 abrogates its interaction with NS3 and impairs the antiviral activity of TRIM38. Our results indicate that TRIM38 is a novel antiviral protein against ZIKV, and it exerts antiviral activity by upregulating the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway, increasing IFN-β levels, and degrading the viral NS3 protein.

TI  - TRIMming down Flavivirus Infections
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - Flaviviruses comprise a large number of arthropod-borne viruses, some of which are associated with life-threatening diseases. Flavivirus infections are rising worldwide, mainly due to the proliferation and geographical expansion of their vectors. The main human pathogens are mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including dengue virus, Zika virus, and West Nile virus, but tick-borne flaviviruses are also emerging. As with any viral infection, the body’s first line of defense against flavivirus infections is the innate immune defense, of which type I interferon is the armed wing. This cytokine exerts its antiviral activity by triggering the synthesis of hundreds of interferon-induced genes (ISGs), whose products can prevent infection. Among the ISGs that inhibit flavivirus replication, certain tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins have been identified. Although involved in other biological processes, TRIMs constitute a large family of antiviral proteins active on a wide range of viruses. Furthermore, whereas some TRIM proteins directly block viral replication, others are positive regulators of the IFN response. Therefore, viruses have developed strategies to evade or counteract TRIM proteins, and some even hijack certain TRIM proteins to their advantage. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge on the interactions between flaviviruses and TRIM proteins, covering both direct and indirect antiviral mechanisms.

TI  - Twist1-IRF9 Interaction Is Necessary for IFN-Stimulated Gene Anti-Zika Viral Infection.
JF  - Journal of immunology
AB  - An efficient immune defense against pathogens requires sufficient basal sensing mechanisms that can deliver prompt responses. Type I IFNs are protective against acute viral infections and respond to viral and bacterial infections, but their efficacy depends on constitutive basal activity that promotes the expression of downstream genes known as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Type I IFNs and ISGs are constitutively produced at low quantities and yet exert profound effects essential for numerous physiological processes beyond antiviral and antimicrobial defense, including immunomodulation, cell cycle regulation, cell survival, and cell differentiation. Although the canonical response pathway for type I IFNs has been extensively characterized, less is known regarding the transcriptional regulation of constitutive ISG expression. Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a major risk for human pregnancy complications and fetal development and depends on an appropriate IFN-β response. However, it is poorly understood how ZIKV, despite an IFN-β response, causes miscarriages. We have uncovered a mechanism for this function specifically in the context of the early antiviral response. Our results demonstrate that IFN regulatory factor (IRF9) is critical in the early response to ZIKV infection in human trophoblast. This function is contingent on IRF9 binding to Twist1. In this signaling cascade, Twist1 was not only a required partner that promotes IRF9 binding to the IFN-stimulated response element but also an upstream regulator that controls basal levels of IRF9. The absence of Twist1 renders human trophoblast cells susceptible to ZIKV infection.

TI  - Ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 1 interacts with Zika virus NS5 and promotes viral replication in the infected cell
JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 106
AB  - Abstract Translation errors, impaired folding or environmental stressors (e.g. infection) can all lead to an increase in the presence of misfolded proteins. These activate cellular responses to their removal, including intracellular protein degradation activities. Protein ubiquitylation is involved in two major degradation pathways, the ubiquitin-proteasome system and selective autophagy. In humans, the ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 1 (UBA1) is the primary E1 enzyme in the ubiquitin conjugation cascade. Viruses have evolved to exploit protein degradation pathways to complete their infection cycles. Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging orthoflavivirus causing serious neurologic disorders in neonates (congenital microcephaly) and adults (Guillain–Barré syndrome). Non-structural protein 5 (NS5), the largest and most conserved protein in the orthoflaviviruses, catalyses the synthesis and capping of new viral genomes. In addition to viral RNA replication in the cytoplasm, ZIKV NS5 is translocated into the nucleus to interfere with host antiviral responses. Here, we demonstrate that ZIKV NS5 co-immunoprecipitates with cellular UBA1. Immunofluorescence assays suggest that this interaction takes place primarily in the nucleus of an infected cell, although colocalization of both proteins is also detected in the cytosol. RNA interference-mediated depletion of UBA1 leads to reduced virus titres in the infected cells, while transient overexpression of UBA1 favours faster replication kinetics, with higher virus titres and protein levels detected. Moreover, UBA1-targeting drugs cause significant drops in virus infectivity. These results support a proviral role for UBA1 during ZIKV infection and encourage the potential use of inhibitors against this enzyme or its NS5-interacting epitopes as potential therapeutic targets.

TI  - Ubiquitination of NS1 Confers Differential Adaptation of Zika Virus in Mammalian Hosts and Mosquito Vectors
JF  - Advanced Science
VL  - 11
AB  - Arboviruses, transmitted by medical arthropods, pose a serious health threat worldwide. During viral infection, Post Translational Modifications (PTMs) are present on both host and viral proteins, regulating multiple processes of the viral lifecycle. In this study, a mammalian E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP2 (WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase 2) is identified, which interacts with the NS1 protein of Zika virus (ZIKV) and mediates K63 and K48 ubiquitination of Lys 265 and Lys 284, respectively. WWP2‐mediated NS1 ubiquitination leads to NS1 degradation via the ubiquitin‐proteasome pathway, thereby inhibiting ZIKV infection in mammalian hosts. Simultaneously, it is found Su(dx), a protein highly homologous to host WWP2 in mosquitoes, is capable of ubiquitinating NS1 in mosquito cells. Unexpectedly, ubiquitination of NS1 in mosquitoes does not lead to NS1 degradation; instead, it promotes viral infection in mosquitoes. Correspondingly, the NS1 K265R mutant virus is less infectious to mosquitoes than the wild‐type (WT) virus. The above results suggest that the ubiquitination of the NS1 protein confers different adaptations of ZIKV to hosts and vectors, and more importantly, this explains why NS1 K265‐type strains have become predominantly endemic in nature. This study highlights the potential application in antiviral drug and vaccine development by targeting viral proteins' PTMs.

TI  - UFMylation promotes orthoflavivirus infectious particle production
JF  - Journal of Virology
AB  - ABSTRACT Post-translational modifications play crucial roles in regulating viral infections, yet roles for many modifications remain unexplored in orthoflavivirus biology. Here, we demonstrate that the UFMylation system, a post-translational modification pathway that catalyzes the transfer of UFM1 onto proteins and promotes infection by multiple orthoflaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus. We found that depletion of the UFMylation E3 ligase complex proteins UFL1 and UFBP1, as well as other UFMylation machinery components (UBA5, UFC1, and UFM1), significantly reduces orthoflavivirus infectious virion production. This regulation was specific to orthoflaviviruses as the hepacivirus and member of the broader Flaviviridae family, hepatitis C virus, was not regulated by UFL1. Mechanistically, UFMylation did not regulate viral RNA translation, RNA replication, or virion egress but instead affected the assembly of infectious virions. Furthermore, we identified novel interactions between UFL1 and several viral proteins involved in orthoflavivirus virion assembly, including NS2A, NS2B-NS3, and capsid. These findings establish UFMylation as a previously unrecognized post-translational modification pathway that promotes orthoflavivirus infection through modulation of viral assembly. This work expands our understanding of the post-translational modifications that control orthoflavivirus infection and identifies new potential therapeutic targets. IMPORTANCE Orthoflaviviruses depend on host-mediated post-translational modifications to successfully complete their life cycle, yet many of these critical interactions remain undefined. Here, we describe a role for a post-translational modification pathway, UFMylation, in promoting infectious particle production of ZIKV and DENV. We show that UFMylation is dispensable for initial RNA translation and RNA replication but promotes the assembly of infectious virions. Additionally, we find that regulation of infection by UFMylation extends to other orthoflaviviruses, including West Nile virus and yellow fever virus, but not to the broader Flaviviridae family. Finally, we demonstrate that UFMylation machinery directly interacts with specific DENV and ZIKV proteins during infection. These studies reveal a previously unrecognized role for UFMylation in regulating orthoflavivirus infection.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has infected thousands of Brazilian people and spread to other American countries since 2015. The introduction of ZIKV brought a strong impact to public health in Brazil. It is of utmost importance to identify a susceptible cell line that will enable the isolation and identification of the virus from patient samples, viral mass production, and testing of drug and vaccine candidates. Besides real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction diagnosis for detecting the viral genome, virus isolation in cell lines was useful in order to study the structure of the viral particle and its behaviour inside cells. Analysis of ZIKV infected cell lines was achieved using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Blood was obtained from a Brazilian patient during the first days after presenting with signs of the disease, and ZIKV from the patient’s blood was isolated in the C6/36 mosquito cell line. Afterwards, Vero cells were inoculated with the viral suspension, fixed six days after inoculation, embedded in polymers, and ultra-thin cut. Like dengue viruses, this flavivirus showed numerous virus particles present inside cellular vesicles thereby confirming the susceptibility of the Vero cell line to ZIKV replication. TEM is a unique technique available to make the virus visible.

TI  - UMP‐CMP kinase 2 inhibits ZIKV replication through activation of type I IFN signaling pathway
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - Cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 2 (UMP‐CMP kinase 2, CMPK2) has been reported as an antiviral interferon‐stimulated gene (ISG). We previously observed that the expression of CMPK2 was significantly upregulated after Zika Virus (ZIKV) infection in A549 cells. However, the association and the underlying mechanisms between CMPK2 induction and ZIKV replication remain to be determined. We investigated the induction of CMPK2 during ZIKV infection and the effect of CMPK2 on ZIKV replication in A549, U251, Vero, IFNAR‐deficient U5A and its parental 2fTGH cells, Huh7 and its RIG‐I‐deficient derivatives Huh7.5.1 cells. The activation status of Jak‐STAT signaling pathway was determined by detecting the phosphorylation level of STAT1, the activity of interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) and the expression of several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that ZIKV infection induced CMPK2 expression through an IFNAR and RIG‐I dependent manner. Overexpression of CMPK2 inhibited while CMPK2 knockdown promoted ZIKV replication in A549 and U251 cells. Mechanically, we found that CMPK2 overexpression increased IFNβ expression and activated Jak/STAT signaling pathway as shown by the increased level of p‐STAT1, enhanced activity of ISRE, and the upregulated expression of downstream ISGs. These findings suggest that ZIKV infection induced CMPK2 expression, which inhibited ZIKV replication and serves as a positive feedback regulator for IFN‐Jak/STAT pathway.

TI  - Understanding microcephaly through the study of centrosome regulation in Drosophila neural stem cells.
JF  - Biochemical Society transactions
AB  - Microcephaly is a rare, yet devastating, neurodevelopmental condition caused by genetic or environmental insults, such as the Zika virus infection. Microcephaly manifests with a severely reduced head circumference. Among the known heritable microcephaly genes, a significant proportion are annotated with centrosome-related ontologies. Centrosomes are microtubule-organizing centers, and they play fundamental roles in the proliferation of the neuronal progenitors, the neural stem cells (NSCs), which undergo repeated rounds of asymmetric cell division to drive neurogenesis and brain development. Many of the genes, pathways, and developmental paradigms that dictate NSC development in humans are conserved in Drosophila melanogaster. As such, studies of Drosophila NSCs lend invaluable insights into centrosome function within NSCs and help inform the pathophysiology of human microcephaly. This mini-review will briefly survey causative links between deregulated centrosome functions and microcephaly with particular emphasis on insights learned from Drosophila NSCs.

TI  - Understanding the role of microRNAs in the interaction of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with an insect-specific flavivirus.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 98 7
SP  - 1892
EP  - 1903
AB  - The Flavivirus genus contains some of the most prevalent vector-borne viruses, such as the dengue, Zika and yellow fever viruses that cause devastating diseases in humans. However, the insect-specific clade of flaviviruses is restricted to mosquito hosts, albeit they have retained the general features of the genus, such as genome structure and replication. The interactions between insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) and their mosquito hosts are largely unknown. Pathogenic flaviviruses are known to modulate host-derived microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs that are important in controlling gene expression. Alterations in miRNAs may represent changes in host gene expression and promote understanding of virus-host interactions. The role of miRNAs in ISF-mosquito interactions is largely unknown. A recently discovered Australian ISF, Palm Creek virus (PCV), has the ability to suppress medically relevant flaviviruses. Here, we investigated the potential involvement of miRNAs in PCV infection using the model mosquito Aedes aegypti. By combining small-RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, differentially expressed miRNAs were determined. Our results indicated that PCV infection hardly affects host miRNAs. Out of 101 reported miRNAs of Ae. aegypti, only aae-miR-2940-5p had a significantly altered expression over the course of infection. However, further analysis of aae-miR-2940-5p revealed that this miRNA does not have any direct impact on PCV replication in vitro. Thus, overall the results suggest that PCV infection has a limited effect on the mosquito miRNA profile and therefore miRNAs may not play a significant role in the PCV-Ae. aegypti interaction.

TI  - Unravelling the Mysteries of Zika Virus: A Comprehensive Overview
JF  - Global Journal of Universal Studies
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV), which emerged in an epidemic state in 2016, poses a serious risk to the health of society. It could appear as a serious condition with signs such as migraine and a high body temperature or it can appear benign. Aedes species of mosquitoes (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) are responsible for the transmission of ZIKA virus to humans. Even though over half of civilization lives in areas where Aedes aegypti is common, there is still concern about the possibility of its revival. Global accounts of Zika virus infections have recently been made, especially from America; French Polynesia and other Pacific Island nations; and south-East Asia. ZIKV was first discovered in 1947 in the Ugandan Zika Forest, in a rhesus monkey. Since the beginning of discoveries in Africa and Asia in 2007, the virus expanded around every continent. A serious infection frequently results in a short-term febrile illness, but recent evidence reveals that it may also be linked to additional important adverse effects like microcephaly in infants and Guillain-Barré syndrome. This review provides knowledge about the pathophysiology of ZIKV, reveals essential cellular processes that develop during infections, and recalls the origins of the virus from when it was first discovered to its current worldwide propagation.

TI  - USP38 Inhibits Zika Virus Infection by Removing Envelope Protein Ubiquitination
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, and its infection may cause severe neurodegenerative diseases. The outbreak of ZIKV in 2015 in South America has caused severe human congenital and neurologic disorders. Thus, it is vitally important to determine the inner mechanism of ZIKV infection. Here, our data suggested that the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 38 (USP38) played an important role in host resistance to ZIKV infection, during which ZIKV infection did not affect USP38 expression. Mechanistically, USP38 bound to the ZIKV envelope (E) protein through its C-terminal domain and attenuated its K48-linked and K63-linked polyubiquitination, thereby repressed the infection of ZIKV. In addition, we found that the deubiquitinase activity of USP38 was essential to inhibit ZIKV infection, and the mutant that lacked the deubiquitinase activity of USP38 lost the ability to inhibit infection. In conclusion, we found a novel host protein USP38 against ZIKV infection, and this may represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of ZIKV infection.

TI  - Valosin‐containing protein ATPase activity regulates the morphogenesis of Zika virus replication organelles and virus‐induced cell death
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 23
AB  - With no available therapies, infections with Zika virus (ZIKV) constitute a major public health concern as they can lead to congenital microcephaly. In order to generate an intracellular environment favourable to viral replication, ZIKV induces endomembrane remodelling and the morphogenesis of replication factories via enigmatic mechanisms. In this study, we identified the AAA+ type ATPase valosin‐containing protein (VCP) as a cellular interaction partner of ZIKV non‐structural protein 4B (NS4B). Importantly, its pharmacological inhibition as well as the expression of a VCP dominant‐negative mutant impaired ZIKV replication. In infected cells, VCP is relocalised to large ultrastructures containing both NS4B and NS3, which are reminiscent of dengue virus convoluted membranes. Moreover, short treatment with the VCP inhibitors NMS‐873 or CB‐5083 drastically decreased the abundance and size of ZIKV‐induced convoluted membranes. Furthermore, NMS‐873 treatment inhibited ZIKV‐induced mitochondria elongation previously reported to be physically and functionally linked to convoluted membranes in case of the closely related dengue virus. Finally, VCP inhibition resulted in enhanced apoptosis of ZIKV‐infected cells strongly suggesting that convoluted membranes limit virus‐induced cytopathic effects. Altogether, this study identifies VCP as a host factor required for ZIKV life cycle and more precisely, for the maintenance of viral replication factories. Our data further support a model in which convoluted membranes regulate ZIKV life cycle by impacting on mitochondrial functions and ZIKV‐induced death signals in order to create a cytoplasmic environment favourable to viral replication.

TI  - Very-long-chain fatty acid metabolic capacity of 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 12 (HSD17B12) promotes replication of hepatitis C virus and related flaviviruses
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 10
AB  - Flaviviridae infections represent a major global health burden. By deciphering mechanistic aspects of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-host interactions, one could discover common strategy for inhibiting the replication of related flaviviruses. By elucidating the HCV interactome, we identified the 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 12 (HSD17B12) as a human hub of the very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) synthesis pathway and core interactor. Here we show that HSD17B12 knockdown (KD) impairs HCV replication and reduces virion production. Mechanistically, depletion of HSD17B12 induces alterations in VLCFA-containing lipid species and a drastic reduction of lipid droplets (LDs) that play a critical role in virus assembly. Oleic acid supplementation rescues viral RNA replication and production of infectious particles in HSD17B12 depleted cells, supporting a specific role of VLCFA in HCV life cycle. Furthermore, the small-molecule HSD17B12 inhibitor, INH-12, significantly reduces replication and infectious particle production of HCV as well as dengue virus and Zika virus revealing a conserved requirement across Flaviviridae virus family. Overall, the data provide a strong rationale for the advanced evaluation of HSD17B12 inhibition as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral strategy for the treatment of Flaviviridae infections.

TI  - Viperin is an important host restriction factor in control of Zika virus infection
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has emerged as a global health threat and infection of pregnant women causes intrauterine growth restriction, spontaneous abortion and microcephaly in newborns. Here we show using biologically relevant cells of neural and placental origin that following ZIKV infection, there is attenuation of the cellular innate response characterised by reduced expression of IFN-β and associated interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). One such ISG is viperin that has well documented antiviral activity against a wide range of viruses. Expression of viperin in cultured cells resulted in significant impairment of ZIKV replication, while MEFs derived from CRISPR/Cas9 derived viperin−/− mice replicated ZIKV to higher titers compared to their WT counterparts. These results suggest that ZIKV can attenuate ISG expression to avoid the cellular antiviral innate response, thus allowing the virus to replicate unchecked. Moreover, we have identified that the ISG viperin has significant anti-ZIKV activity. Further understanding of how ZIKV perturbs the ISG response and the molecular mechanisms utilised by viperin to suppress ZIKV replication will aid in our understanding of ZIKV biology, pathogenesis and possible design of novel antiviral strategies.

TI  - wMel limits zika and chikungunya virus infection in a Singapore Wolbachia-introgressed Ae. aegypti strain, wMel-Sg
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 11
AB  - Background Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses are emerging Aedes-borne viruses that are spreading outside their known geographic range and causing wide-scale epidemics. It has been reported that these viruses can be transmitted efficiently by Ae. aegypti. Recent studies have shown that Ae. aegypti when transinfected with certain Wolbachia strains shows a reduced replication and dissemination of dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV), and Yellow Fever (YFV) viruses. The aim of this study was to determine whether the wMel strain of Wolbachia introgressed onto a Singapore Ae. aegypti genetic background was able to limit ZIKV and CHIKV infection in the mosquito. Methodology/Principal findings Five to seven-day old mosquitoes either infected or uninfected with wMel Wolbachia were orally infected with a Ugandan strain of ZIKV and several outbreak strains of CHIKV. The midgut and salivary glands of each mosquito were sampled at days 6, 9 and 13 days post infectious blood meal to determine midgut infection and salivary glands dissemination rates, respectively. In general, all wild type Ae. aegypti were found to have high ZIKV and CHIKV infections in their midguts and salivary glands, across all sampling days, compared to Wolbachia infected counterparts. Median viral titre for all viruses in Wolbachia infected mosquitoes were significantly lower across all time points when compared to wild type mosquitoes. Most significantly, all but two and one of the wMel infected mosquitoes had no detectable ZIKV and CHIKV, respectively, in their salivary glands at 14 days post-infectious blood meal. Conclusions Our results showed that wMel limits both ZIKV and CHIKV infection when introgressed into a Singapore Ae. aegypti genetic background. These results also strongly suggest that female Aedes aegypti carrying Wolbachia will have a reduced capacity to transmit ZIKV and CHIKV.

TI  - Wolbachia Inhibits Binding of Dengue and Zika Viruses to Mosquito Cells
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - As traditional approaches to the control of dengue and Zika are insufficient, significant efforts have been made to develop utilization of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia to reduce the ability of mosquitoes to transmit pathogens. Although Wolbachia is known to inhibit flaviviruses in mosquitoes, including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), it remains unclear how the endosymbiont interferes with viral replication cycle. In this study, we have carried out viral binding assays to investigate the impact of the Wolbachia strain wAlbB on the attachment of DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) and ZIKV to Aedes aegypti Aag-2 cells. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to silence a variety of putative mosquito receptors of DENV that were differentially regulated by wAlbB in Aag-2 cells, in order to identify host factors involved in the inhibition of viral binding. Our results showed that, in addition to suppression of viral replication, Wolbachia strongly inhibited binding of both DENV-2 and ZIKV to Aag-2 cells. Moreover, the expression of two putative mosquito DENV receptors – dystroglycan and tubulin – was downregulated by wAlbB, and their knock-down resulted in the inhibition of DENV-2 binding to Aag-2 cells. These results will aid in understanding the Wolbachia-DENV interactions in mosquito and the development of novel control strategies for mosquito-borne diseases.

TI  - Wolbachia interferes with Zika virus replication by hijacking cholesterol metabolism in mosquito cells
JF  - Microbiology Spectrum
VL  - 11
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus is a member of the arbovirus Flaviviridae family transmitted by Aedes mosquitos and it is associated with microcephaly in infants born to infected mothers. Wolbachia is an intracellular gram-negative alpha-proteobacteria that infects many species of arthropods, including mosquitos. The presence of Wolbachia in mosquitos has been shown to control the vector population and suppress arbovirus transmission. One mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated interference with virus replication is competition over host resources between Wolbachia and the virus. We hypothesize that cholesterol metabolism is involved in Wolbachia-mediated virus suppression due to its important role in Zika virus replication. In this study, we determined that Wolbachia impacted virus replication by altering cholesterol biosynthesis in Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells, diverting resources from the host cell mevalonate (MVA) pathway to fulfill the needs of the bacteria. This resulted in a decrease of total cholesterol, increased Wolbachia loads, and decreased viral titers. Inhibition of the MVA pathway using fluvastatin decreased total cholesterol and viral titers, mimicking the effects of Wolbachia on the virus in Wolbachia-free cells. We also found that Wolbachia-infected cells had depleted lipid droplets, the main component of which is cholesterol esters. We confirmed that cholesterol esterases were upregulated in response to virus infection in C6/36 cells. Functional analysis showed that alteration of cholesterol metabolism simulated Wolbachia-mediated inhibition of virus infection in C6/36 cells. Our study provides a mechanism behind Wolbachia-induced interference of arbovirus replication and could help advance strategies to control arbovirus pathogens in insect vectors and human infections. IMPORTANCE Arthropod-borne viruses are emerging pathogens that are spread widely by mosquitos. Zika virus is an arbovirus that can infect humans and be transmitted from an infected mother to the fetus, potentially leading to microcephaly in infants. One promising strategy to prevent disease caused by arboviruses is to target the insect vector population. Recent field studies have shown that mosquito populations infected with Wolbachia bacteria suppress arbovirus replication and transmission. Here, we describe how intracellular bacteria redirect resources within their host cells and suppress Zika virus replication at the cellular level. Understanding the mechanism behind Wolbachia-induced interference of arbovirus replication could help advance strategies to control arbovirus pathogens in insect vectors and human populations.

EP  - 3120
AB  - ABSTRACT Certain strains of the intracellular endosymbiont Wolbachia can strongly inhibit or block the transmission of viruses such as dengue virus (DENV) by Aedes mosquitoes, and the mechanisms responsible are still not well understood. Direct infusion and liquid chromatography-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry-based lipidomics analyses were conducted using Aedes albopictus Aa23 cells that were infected with the wMel and wMelPop strains of Wolbachia in comparison to uninfected Aa23-T cells. Substantial shifts in the cellular lipid profile were apparent in the presence of Wolbachia. Most significantly, almost all sphingolipid classes were depleted, and some reductions in diacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines were also observed. These lipid classes have previously been shown to be selectively enriched in DENV-infected mosquito cells, suggesting that Wolbachia may produce a cellular lipid environment that is antagonistic to viral replication. The data improve our understanding of the intracellular interactions between Wolbachia and mosquitoes. IMPORTANCE Mosquitoes transmit a variety of important viruses to humans, such as dengue virus and Zika virus. Certain strains of the intracellular bacterial genus called Wolbachia found in or introduced into mosquitoes can block the transmission of viruses, including dengue virus, but the mechanisms responsible are not well understood. We found substantial shifts in the cellular lipid profiles in the presence of these bacteria. Some lipid classes previously shown to be enriched in dengue virus-infected mosquito cells were depleted in the presence of Wolbachia, suggesting that Wolbachia may produce a cellular lipid environment that inhibits mosquito-borne viruses.

TI  - Wolbachia strain wAlbA blocks Zika virus transmission in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Medical and Veterinary Entomology
VL  - 34
SP  - 116
EP  - 119
AB  - Transinfections of the maternally transmitted endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis can reduce RNA virus replication and prevent transmission by Aedes aegypti, and also have the capacity to invade wild‐type populations, potentially reaching and maintaining high infection frequencies. Levels of virus transmission blocking are positively correlated with Wolbachia intracellular density. Despite reaching high densities in Ae. aegypti, transinfections of wAlbA, a strain native to Aedes albopictus, showed no blocking of Semliki Forest Virus in previous intrathoracic injection challenges. To further characterize wAlbA blocking in Ae. aegypti, adult females were intrathoracically challenged with Zika (ZIKV) and dengue viruses, and then fed a ZIKV‐containing bloodmeal. No blocking was observed with either virus when challenged by intrathoracic injection. However, when ZIKV was delivered orally, wAlbA‐infected females showed a significant reduction in viral replication and dissemination compared with uninfected controls, as well as a complete absence of virus in saliva. Although other Wolbachia strains have been shown to cause more robust viral blocking in Ae. aegypti, these findings demonstrate that, in principle, wAlbA could be used to reduce virus transmission in this species. Moreover, the results highlight the potential for underestimation of the strength of virus‐blocking when based on intrathoracic injection compared with more natural oral challenges.

TI  - Wolbachia wPip Blocks Zika Virus Transovarial Transmission in Aedes albopictus
JF  - Microbiology Spectrum
VL  - 10
AB  - Area-wide application of Wolbachia to suppress mosquito populations and their transmitted viruses has achieved success in multiple countries. However, the mass release of Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes involves a potential risk of accidentally releasing fertile females. In this study, we employed ovarian cells of the Ae. albopictus GUA, HC, and GT lines, which exhibit key traits, and compared them to better understand how Wolbachia inhibits ZIKV transovarial transmission. ABSTRACT Wolbachia is being developed as a biological tool to suppress mosquito populations and/or interfere with their transmitted viruses. Adult males with an artificial Wolbachia infection have been released, successfully yielding population suppression in multiple field trials. The main characteristic of the artificial Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes used in the suppression program is the lower vector competence than that in native infected/uninfected mosquitoes in horizontal and vertical transmission. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the Aedes albopictus HC line infected with a trio of Wolbachia strains exhibited almost complete blockade of dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in horizontal and vertical transmission. However, the extent to which Wolbachia inhibits virus transovarial transmission is unknown since no studies have been performed to determine whether Wolbachia protects ovarian cells against viral infection. Here, we employed ovarian cells of the Ae. albopictus GUA (a wild-type mosquito line superinfected with two native Wolbachia strains, wAlbA and wAlbB), HC, and GT lines (tetracycline-cured, Wolbachia-uninfected mosquitoes), which exhibit key traits, and compared them to better understand how Wolbachia inhibits ZIKV transovarial transmission. Our results showed that the infection rate of adult GT progeny was significantly higher than that of GUA progeny during the first and second gonotrophic cycles. In contrast, the infection rates of adult GT and GUA progeny were not significantly different during the third gonotrophic cycle. All examined adult HC progeny from three gonotrophic cycles were negative for ZIKV infection. A strong negative linear correlation existed between Wolbachia density and ZIKV load in the ovaries of mosquitoes. Although there is no obvious coexistence area in the ovaries for Wolbachia and ZIKV, host immune responses may play a role in Wolbachia blocking ZIKV expansion and maintenance in the ovaries of Ae. albopictus. These results will aid in understanding Wolbachia-ZIKV interactions in mosquitoes. IMPORTANCE Area-wide application of Wolbachia to suppress mosquito populations and their transmitted viruses has achieved success in multiple countries. However, the mass release of Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes involves a potential risk of accidentally releasing fertile females. In this study, we employed ovarian cells of the Ae. albopictus GUA, HC, and GT lines, which exhibit key traits, and compared them to better understand how Wolbachia inhibits ZIKV transovarial transmission. Our results showed an almost complete blockade of ZIKV transmission in HC female mosquitoes. Wolbachia in natively infected GUA mosquitoes negative affected ZIKV, and this interference was shown by slightly lower loads than those in HC mosquitoes. Overall, our work helps show how Wolbachia blocks ZIKV expansion and maintenance in the ovaries of Ae. albopictus and aids in understanding Wolbachia-ZIKV interactions in mosquitoes.

TI  - Wolbachia-mediated resistance to Zika virus infection in Aedes aegypti is dominated by diverse transcriptional regulation and weak evolutionary pressures
JF  - PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 17
AB  - A promising candidate for arbovirus control and prevention relies on replacing arbovirus-susceptible Aedes aegypti populations with mosquitoes that have been colonized by the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia and thus have a reduced capacity to transmit arboviruses. This reduced capacity to transmit arboviruses is mediated through a phenomenon referred to as pathogen blocking. Pathogen blocking has primarily been proposed as a tool to control dengue virus (DENV) transmission, however it works against a range of viruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV). Despite years of research, the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogen blocking still need to be better understood. Here, we used RNA-seq to characterize mosquito gene transcription dynamics in Ae. aegypti infected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia that are being released by the World Mosquito Program in Medellín, Colombia. Comparative analyses using ZIKV-infected, uninfected tissues, and mosquitoes without Wolbachia revealed that the influence of wMel on mosquito gene transcription is multifactorial. Importantly, because Wolbachia limits, but does not completely prevent, replication of ZIKV and other viruses in coinfected mosquitoes, there is a possibility that these viruses could evolve resistance to pathogen blocking. Therefore, to understand the influence of Wolbachia on within-host ZIKV evolution, we characterized the genetic diversity of molecularly barcoded ZIKV virus populations replicating in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and found that within-host ZIKV evolution was subject to weak purifying selection and, unexpectedly, loose anatomical bottlenecks in the presence and absence of Wolbachia. Together, these findings suggest that there is no clear transcriptional profile associated with Wolbachia-mediated ZIKV restriction, and that there is no evidence for ZIKV escape from this restriction in our system.

TI  - XAF1 Protects Host against Emerging RNA Viruses by Stabilizing IRF1-Dependent Antiviral Immunity
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - Rapid and robust induction of antiviral genes is essential for the host to clear the invaded viruses. In addition to the IRF3/7-IFN-I-STAT1 signaling axis, the XAF1-IRF1 positive feedback loop synergistically or independently drives the transcription of antiviral genes. ABSTRACT XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is an interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) that enhances IFN-induced apoptosis. However, it is unexplored whether XAF1 is essential for the host fighting against invaded viruses. Here, we find that XAF1 is significantly upregulated in the host cells infected with emerging RNA viruses, including influenza, Zika virus (ZIKV), and SARS-CoV-2. IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), a key transcription factor in immune cells, determines the induction of XAF1 during antiviral immunity. Ectopic expression of XAF1 protects host cells against various RNA viruses independent of apoptosis. Knockout of XAF1 attenuates host antiviral innate immunity in vitro and in vivo, which leads to more severe lung injuries and higher mortality in the influenza infection mouse model. XAF1 stabilizes IRF1 protein by antagonizing the CHIP-mediated degradation of IRF1, thus inducing more antiviral IRF1 target genes, including DDX58, DDX60, MX1, and OAS2. Our study has described a protective role of XAF1 in the host antiviral innate immunity against RNA viruses. We have also elucidated the molecular mechanism that IRF1 and XAF1 form a positive feedback loop to induce rapid and robust antiviral immunity. IMPORTANCE Rapid and robust induction of antiviral genes is essential for the host to clear the invaded viruses. In addition to the IRF3/7-IFN-I-STAT1 signaling axis, the XAF1-IRF1 positive feedback loop synergistically or independently drives the transcription of antiviral genes. Moreover, XAF1 is a sensitive and reliable gene that positively correlates with the viral infection, suggesting that XAF1 is a potential diagnostic marker for viral infectious diseases. In addition to the antitumor role, our study has shown that XAF1 is essential for antiviral immunity. XAF1 is not only a proapoptotic ISG, but it also stabilizes the master transcription factor IRF1 to induce antiviral genes. IRF1 directly binds to the IRF-Es of its target gene promoters and drives their transcriptions, which suggests a unique role of the XAF1-IRF1 loop in antiviral innate immunity, particularly in the host defect of IFN-I signaling such as invertebrates.

TI  - Zika M—A Potential Viroporin: Mutational Study and Drug Repurposing
JF  - Biomedicines
VL  - 10
AB  - Genus Flavivirus contains several important human pathogens. Among these, the Zika virus is an emerging etiological agent that merits concern. One of its structural proteins, prM, plays an essential role in viral maturation and assembly, making it an attractive drug and vaccine development target. Herein, we have characterized ZikV-M as a potential viroporin candidate using three different bacteria-based assays. These assays were subsequently employed to screen a library of repurposed drugs from which ten compounds were identified as ZikV-M blockers. Mutational analyses of conserved amino acids in the transmembrane domain of other flaviviruses, including West Nile and Dengue virus, were performed to study their role in ion channel activity. In conclusion, our data show that ZikV-M is a potential ion channel that can be used as a drug target for high throughput screening and drug repurposing.

TI  - Zika virus alters centrosome organization to suppress the innate immune response
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted via mosquitoes and sex to cause congenital neurodevelopmental defects, including microcephaly. Inherited forms of microcephaly (MCPH) are associated with disrupted centrosome organization. Similarly, we found that ZIKV infection disrupted centrosome organization. ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or loss of CEP63 decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection or loss of CEP63 also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactors, Mindbomb1 (MIB1) and DTX4, ubiquitin ligases that respectively activate and degrade TBK1. Therefore, we propose that ZIKV NS3 binds CEP63 to increase centrosomal DTX4 localization and destabilization of TBK1, thereby tempering the innate immune response. In addition to identifying a mechanism by which CEP63 controls the innate immune responses in ZIKV infection, we propose that the altered centrosomal organization caused by altered CEP63 function may contribute to ZIKV-associated microcephaly.

TI  - Zika Virus Alters DNA Methylation of Neural Genes in an Organoid Model of the Developing Human Brain
JF  - mSystems
VL  - 3
AB  - Scientific research on human neural stem cells and cerebral organoids has confirmed the congenital neurotropic and neurodestructive nature of the Zika virus. However, the extent to which prenatal ZIKV infection is associated with more subtle brain alterations, such as epigenetic changes, remains ill defined. Here, we address the question of whether ZIKV infection induces DNA methylation changes with the potential to cause brain disorders later in life. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during early pregnancy can cause microcephaly and associated defects at birth, but whether it can induce neurologic sequelae that appear later in life remains unclear. Using a model of the developing brain based on embryonic stem cell-derived brain organoids, we studied the impact of ZIKV infection on the DNA methylation pattern across the entire genome in selected neural cell types. The virus unexpectedly alters the DNA methylome of neural progenitors, astrocytes, and differentiated neurons at genes that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of brain disorders, most prominently mental retardation and schizophrenia. Our results suggest that ZIKV infection during fetal development could lead to a spectrum of delayed-onset neuropsychiatric complications. IMPORTANCE Scientific research on human neural stem cells and cerebral organoids has confirmed the congenital neurotropic and neurodestructive nature of the Zika virus.

JF  - Epigenomics
AB  - Aim: This study was aimed to understand if Zika virus (ZIKV) alters the DNA methylome of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs). Materials & methods: Whole genome DNA methylation profiling was performed using human methylationEPIC array in control and ZIKV infected hNPCs. Results & conclusion: ZIKV infection altered the DNA methylation of several genes such as WWTR1 (TAZ) and RASSF1 of Hippo signaling pathway which regulates organ size during brain development, and decreased the expression of several centrosomal-related microcephaly genes, and genes involved in stemness and differentiation in human neural progenitor cells. Overall, ZIKV downregulated the Hippo signaling pathway genes which perturb the stemness and differentiation process in hNPCs, which could form the basis for ZIKV-induced microcephaly.

EP  - 588
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus belonging to the genus Flavivirus (Flaviviridae). ZIKV infection is associated with alterations in various organs, including the liver, lungs, and kidneys. Studies on the influence of posttranscriptional control on viral infections have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) interfere with different stages of the replicative cycle of several viruses and may influence the disease outcome. To shed light on ZIKV-induced regulation of host miRNA-processing machinery in the above organs, we analyzed the expression of genes encoding key proteins of the miRNA pathway in different ZIKV-infected continuous primate cell lineages (HepG2, A549, and MA104) by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Expression of the genes encoding the miRNA-related proteins DGCR8, Ago1, and Ago3 in HepG2 cells and Drosha, Dicer, Ago2, and Ago3 in A549 and MA104 cells was significantly altered in the presence of ZIKV. Our results suggest that ZIKV modulates miRNA levels during infection in liver, lung, and kidney cells, which may be an additional mechanism of host cell subversion in these organs.

TI  - Zika virus alters the microRNA expression profile and elicits an RNAi response in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti, has recently spread globally in an unprecedented fashion, yet we have a poor understanding of host-microbe interactions in this system. To gain insights into the interplay between ZIKV and the mosquito, we sequenced the small RNA profiles in ZIKV-infected and non-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes at 2, 7 and 14 days post-infection. ZIKA induced an RNAi response in the mosquito with virus-derived short interfering RNAs and PIWI-interacting RNAs dramatically increased in abundance post-infection. Further, we found 17 host microRNAs (miRNAs) that were modulated by ZIKV infection at all time points. Strikingly, many of these regulated miRNAs have been reported to have their expression altered by dengue and West Nile viruses, while the response was divergent from that induced by the alphavirus Chikungunya virus in mosquitoes. This suggests that conserved miRNA responses occur within mosquitoes in response to flavivirus infection. This study expands our understanding of ZIKV-vector interactions and provides potential avenues to be further investigated to target ZIKV in the mosquito host.

TI  - Zika virus antagonizes interferon response in patients and disrupts RIG-I–MAVS interaction through its CARD-TM domains
JF  - Cell & Bioscience
VL  - 9
AB  - The emerging threat to global health associated with the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemics and its link to severe complications highlights a growing need to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms of ZIKV. Accumulating evidence for a critical role of type I interferon (IFN-I) in protecting hosts from ZIKV infection lies in the findings that ZIKV has evolved various strategies to subvert the host defense line by counteracting the early IFN induction or subsequent IFN signaling. Yet, mechanisms underlying the counter-IFN capability of ZIKV and its proteins, which might contribute to the well-recognized broad cellular tropisms and persistence of ZIKV, remain incompletely understood. Using RNA sequencing-based transcriptional profiling of whole blood cells isolated from patients acutely infected by ZIKV, we found that transcriptional signature programs of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes and innate immune sensors in ZIKV-infected patients remained inactive as compared to those of healthy donors, suggesting that ZIKV was able to suppress the induction of IFN-I during the natural infection process in humans. Furthermore, by analyzing the molecular interaction in a ZIKV NS4A-overexpression system, or in the context of actual ZIKV infection, we identified that ZIKV NS4A directly bound MAVS and thereby interrupted the RIG-I/MAVS interaction through the CARD-TM domains, leading to attenuated production of IFN-I. Our findings collectively revealed that ZIKV NS4A targeted MAVS and contributed to ZIKV immune evasion through abrogating MAVS-mediated IFN production. These findings obtained from patient studies have added new knowledge and molecular details to our understanding regarding how ZIKV mediates suppression of the IFN-I system and may provide a new basis for the future development of anti-ZIKV strategies.

TI  - Zika Virus Antagonizes Type I Interferon Responses during Infection of Human Dendritic Cells
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that is causally linked to severe neonatal birth defects, including microcephaly, and is associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Dendritic cells (DCs) are an important cell type during infection by multiple mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including dengue virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and yellow fever virus. Despite this, the interplay between ZIKV and DCs remains poorly defined. Here, we found human DCs supported productive infection by a contemporary Puerto Rican isolate with considerable variability in viral replication, but not viral binding, between DCs from different donors. Historic isolates from Africa and Asia also infected DCs with distinct viral replication kinetics between strains. African lineage viruses displayed more rapid replication kinetics and infection magnitude as compared to Asian lineage viruses, and uniquely induced cell death. Infection of DCs with both contemporary and historic ZIKV isolates led to minimal up-regulation of T cell co-stimulatory and MHC molecules, along with limited secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) protein translation was observed during ZIKV infection, despite strong induction at the RNA transcript level and up-regulation of other host antiviral proteins. Treatment of human DCs with RIG-I agonist potently restricted ZIKV replication, while type I IFN had only modest effects. Mechanistically, we found all strains of ZIKV antagonized type I IFN-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. Combined, our findings show that ZIKV subverts DC immunogenicity during infection, in part through evasion of type I IFN responses, but that the RLR signaling pathway is still capable of inducing an antiviral state, and therefore may serve as an antiviral therapeutic target.

TI  - Zika Virus Capsid Anchor Forms Cytotoxic Amyloid-like Fibrils
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Capsid-anchor (CA) of Zika virus (ZIKV) is a small, single-pass transmembrane sequence that separates the capsid (C) protein from downstream pre-membrane (PrM) protein. During ZIKV polyprotein processing, CA is cleaved-off from C and PrM and left as a membrane-embedded peptide. CA plays an essential role in the assembly and maturation of the virus. However, its independent folding behavior is still unknown. Since misfolding and aggregation propensity of transmembrane proteins are now increasingly recognized and has been linked to several proteopathic disorders. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the amyloid-forming propensity of CA at physiological conditions. We observed aggregation behavior of CA peptide using dyebinding assays and ThT kinetics. The morphological analysis of CA aggregates explored by high-resolution microscopy (TEM and AFM) revealed characteristic amyloid-like fibrils. Further, the effect on mammalian cells exhibited the cytotoxic nature of the CA amyloid-fibrils. Our findings collectively shed light on the amyloidogenic phenomenon of flaviviral protein, which may contribute to their infection. Graphical Abstract: Schematic representation of Zika virus Capsid anchor forming amyloid aggregates with cytotoxic and hemolytic properties.

TI  - Zika virus capsid protein closed structure modulates binding to host lipid systems
JF  - Protein Science
VL  - 33
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito‐borne Flavivirus of international concern, causes congenital microcephaly in newborns and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. ZIKV capsid (C) protein, one of three key structural proteins, is essential for viral assembly and encapsidation. In dengue virus, a closely related flavivirus, the homologous C protein interacts with host lipid systems, namely intracellular lipid droplets, for successful viral replication. Here, we investigate ZIKV C interaction with host lipid systems, showing that it binds host lipid droplets but, contrary to expected, in an unspecific manner. Contrasting with other flaviviruses, ZIKV C also does not bind very‐low density‐lipoproteins. Comparing with other Flavivirus, capsid proteins show that ZIKV C structure is particularly thermostable and seems to be locked into an auto‐inhibitory conformation due to a disordered N‐terminal, hence blocking specific interactions and supporting the experimental differences observed. Such distinct structural features must be considered when targeting capsid proteins in drug development.

TI  - Zika virus degrades the ω-3 fatty acid transporter Mfsd2a in brain microvascular endothelial cells and impairs lipid homeostasis
JF  - Science Advances
VL  - 5
AB  - Both the endothelial transporter Mfsd2a and docosahexaenoic acid uptake are disrupted in Zika virus–induced microcephaly models. Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy increases the risk of postnatal microcephaly. Neurovascular function provides a homeostatic environment for proper brain development. The major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2 (Mfsd2a) is selectively expressed in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) and is the major transporter mediating the brain uptake of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We have discovered a pivotal role for Mfsd2a in the pathogenesis of ZIKV. ZIKV disrupted Mfsd2a both in cultured primary hBMECs and in the neonatal mouse brain. ZIKV envelope (E) protein specifically interacted with Mfsd2a and promoted Mfsd2a polyubiquitination for proteasome-dependent degradation. Infection with ZIKV or ectopic expression of ZIKV E impaired Mfsd2a-mediated DHA uptake. Lipidomic analysis revealed obvious differences in DHA-containing lipids after ZIKV infection. Supplementation with DHA rescued ZIKV-caused growth restriction and microcephaly. Our findings suggest endothelial Mfsd2a as an important pathogenic mediator and supplementation with DHA as a potential therapeutic option for ZIKV infection.

TI  - Zika virus dumbbell-1 structure is critical for sfRNA presence and cytopathic effect during infection
JF  - mBio
VL  - 14
AB  - ABSTRACT All flaviviruses contain conserved RNA structures in the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) that are important for flavivirus RNA replication, translation, and pathogenesis. Flaviviruses like Zika virus (ZIKV) contain multiple conserved RNA structures in the viral 3′ UTR, including the structure known as dumbbell-1 (DB-1). Previous research has shown that the DB-1 structure is important for flavivirus positive-strand genome replication, but the functional role of the flavivirus DB-1 structure and the mechanism by which it contributes to viral pathogenesis are not known. Using the recently solved flavivirus DB RNA structural data, we designed two DB-1 mutant ZIKV infectious clones, termed ZIKV-TL.PK and ZIKV-p.2.5′, which disrupt DB-1 tertiary folding. We found that viral positive-strand genome replication of both ZIKV DB-1 mutant clones is similar to wild-type (WT) ZIKV, but ZIKV DB-1 mutants exhibit significantly decreased cytopathic effect due to reduced caspase-3 activation. We next show that ZIKV DB-1 mutants exhibit decreased levels of sfRNA species compared to ZIKV-WT during infection. However, ZIKV DB-1 mutant 3′ UTRs exhibit unchanged sfRNA biogenesis following XRN1 degradation in vitro. We also found that ZIKV DB-1 mutant virus (ZIKV-p.2.5′) exhibited enhanced sensitivity to type I interferon treatment, and both ZIKV-DB-1 mutants exhibit reduced morbidity and mortality due to tissue-specific attenuated viral replication in brain tissue of interferon type I/II receptor knockout mice. We propose that the flavivirus DB-1 RNA structure maintains sfRNA levels during infection despite maintained sfRNA biogenesis, and these results indicate that ZIKV DB-dependent maintenance of sfRNA levels support caspase-3-dependent, cytopathic effect, type I interferon resistance, and viral pathogenesis in mammalian cells and in a ZIKV murine model of disease. IMPORTANCE The group of viruses termed flaviviruses cause important disease throughout the world and include dengue virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and many more. All of these flaviviruses have highly conserved RNA structures in the untranslated regions of the virus genome. One of the shared RNA structures, termed the dumbbell region, is not well studied, but mutations in this region are important for vaccine development. In this study, we made structure-informed targeted mutations in the Zika virus dumbbell region and studied the effect on the virus. We found that Zika virus dumbbell mutants are significantly weakened or attenuated due to a decreased ability to produce non-coding RNA that is needed to support infection, support virus-induced cell death, and support escape from the host immune system. These data show that targeted mutations in the flavivirus dumbbell RNA structure may be an important approach to develop future vaccine candidates.

TI  - Zika virus E protein modulates functions of human brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes: implications on blood-brain barrier properties
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience
VL  - 17
AB  - Neurotropic viruses can cross the otherwise dynamically regulated blood-brain barrier (BBB) and affect the brain cells. Zika virus (ZIKV) is an enveloped neurotropic Flavivirus known to cause severe neurological complications, such as encephalitis and fetal microcephaly. In the present study, we employed human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) and astrocytes derived from human progenitors to establish a physiologically relevant BBB model. We used this model to investigate the effects of ZIKV envelope (E) protein on properties of cells comprising the BBB. E protein is the principal viral protein involved in interaction with host cell surface receptors, facilitating the viral entry. Our findings show that the presence of ZIKV E protein leads to activation of both hBMECs and astrocytes. In hBMECs, we observed a decrease in the expression of crucial endothelial junction proteins such as ZO-1, Occludin and VE-Cadherin, which are vital in establishment and maintenance of the BBB. Consequently, the ZIKV E protein induced changes in BBB integrity and permeability. We also found upregulation of genes involved in leukocyte recruitment along with increased proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines upon exposure to E protein. Additionally, the E protein also led to astrogliosis, evident from the elevated expression of GFAP and Vimentin. Both cell types comprising the BBB exhibited inflammatory response upon exposure to E protein which may influence viral access into the central nervous system (CNS) and subsequent infection of other CNS cells. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the transient changes that occur at the site of BBB upon ZIKV infection.

TI  - Zika virus elicits inflammation to evade antiviral response by cleaving cGAS via NS1‐caspase‐1 axis
JF  - The EMBO Journal
VL  - 37
AB  - Viral infection triggers host innate immune responses, which primarily include the activation of type I interferon (IFN) signaling and inflammasomes. Here, we report that Zika virus (ZIKV) infection triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which is further enhanced by viral non‐structural protein NS1 to benefit its replication. NS1 recruits the host deubiquitinase USP8 to cleave K11‐linked poly‐ubiquitin chains from caspase‐1 at Lys134, thus inhibiting the proteasomal degradation of caspase‐1. The enhanced stabilization of caspase‐1 by NS1 promotes the cleavage of cGAS, which recognizes mitochondrial DNA release and initiates type I IFN signaling during ZIKV infection. NLRP3 deficiency increases type I IFN production and strengthens host resistance to ZIKVin vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our work unravels a novel antagonistic mechanism employed by ZIKV to suppress host immune response by manipulating the interplay between inflammasome and type I IFN signaling, which might guide the rational design of therapeutics in the future.

TI  - Zika Virus Encoding Nonglycosylated Envelope Protein Is Attenuated and Defective in Neuroinvasion
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus responsible for sporadic outbreaks of mild and febrile illness in Africa and Asia, reemerged in the last decade causing serious human diseases, including microcephaly, congenital malformations, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Although genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that genetic evolution may have led to the enhanced virulence of ZIKV, experimental evidence supporting the role of specific genetic changes in virulence is currently lacking. One sequence motif, VNDT, containing an N-linked glycosylation site in the envelope (E) protein, is polymorphic; it is absent in many of the African isolates but present in all isolates from the recent outbreaks. In the present study, we investigated the roles of this sequence motif and glycosylation of the E protein in the pathogenicity of ZIKV. We first constructed a stable full-length cDNA clone of ZIKV in a novel linear vector from which infectious virus was recovered. The recombinant ZIKV generated from the infectious clone, which contains the VNDT motif, is highly pathogenic and causes lethality in a mouse model. In contrast, recombinant viruses from which the VNDT motif is deleted or in which the N-linked glycosylation site is mutated by single-amino-acid substitution are highly attenuated and nonlethal. The mutant viruses replicate poorly in the brains of infected mice when inoculated subcutaneously but replicate well following intracranial inoculation. Our findings provide the first evidence that N-linked glycosylation of the E protein is an important determinant of ZIKV virulence and neuroinvasion. IMPORTANCE The recent emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas has caused major worldwide public health concern. The virus appears to have gained significant pathogenicity, causing serious human diseases, including microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. The factors responsible for the emergence of pathogenic ZIKV are not understood at this time, although genetic changes have been shown to facilitate virus transmission. All isolates from the recent outbreaks contain an N-linked glycosylation site within the viral envelope (E) protein, whereas many isolates of the African lineage virus lack this site. To elucidate the functional significance of glycosylation in ZIKV pathogenicity, recombinant ZIKVs from infectious clones with or without the glycan on the E protein were generated. ZIKVs lacking the glycan were highly attenuated for the ability to cause mortality in a mouse model and were severely compromised for neuroinvasion. Our studies suggest glycosylation of the E protein is an important factor contributing to ZIKV pathogenicity.

TI  - Zika Virus Enters Soma of Neuron through NGF/TrkA-Like Endosomal Signaling Pathway
AB  - Infection with the Zika virus results in severe neurological disease in adults or congenital Zika syndrome in newborns. We employed the domain search strategy to study the Zika virus glycoprotein E in this work. The results revealed that immature E contains a NGF domain (“MNKCYIQIMDLGHMCDATMSYECPMLDEGVEPDDVDCWCNTTSTWVVYGTCHH”) and is capable of interacting with TrkA. The E/TrkA complex increased E's interaction with receptors such as Axl and facilitated Zika virus endocytosis via clathrin. Rab5 retrograded transmission of Zika virus-containing E/TrkA endosomal signals to neuronal soma. Rab7 helped dissociation of E/TrkA in late acidic endosomes, and then E became mature after the NGF domain was cut. After membrane fusion with the endosome, the Zika virus was released into the neuron cell body. It showed only the immature E protein of Zika had NGF activity. The retrograde trafficking of endosomal signals (E/TrkA) similar to NGF/TrkA enabled Zika virus to infect neuronal cells. E's interference with the TrkA signal impaired neuronal cell growth and results in neuronal cell apoptosis.

TI  - Zika Virus Envelope Protein Forms Disulfide Bond-dependent Polymers in Connection with a Persistent ER Stress in A549 Cells
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - Flaviviruses replicate in membranous factories associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Significant levels of flavivirus polyprotein integration contribute to ER stress and the host cell may exhibit an Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) to this protein accumulation, stimulating appropriate cellular responses such as adaptation, autophagy or cell death. These different stress responses support other antiviral strategies initiated by infected cells and can help to overcome viral infection. In epithelial A549 cells, a model currently used to study the flavivirus infection cycle and the host cell responses, all three pathways leading to UPR are activated during infection by Dengue virus (DENV), Yellow Fever virus (YFV) or West Nile virus (WNV). In the present study, we investigated the capacity of ZIKA virus (ZIKV) to induce ER stress in A549 cells. We observed that the cells respond to ZIKV infection by implementing an UPR through activation of the IRE1 and PERK pathway without activation of the ATF6 branch. By modulating the ER stress response, we found that UPR inducers significantly inhibit ZIKV replication. Interestingly, our findings provide evidence that ZIKV could manipulate the UPR to escape this host cell defence system. Since incomplete UPR could lead to unresolved and persistent ER stress, we found that ZIKV infection was associated with an abnormal accumulation of viral envelope proteins, which were aggregated with non-native disulfide bridges. As the presence of these “amyloid like” protein polymers may be cytopathic, our observations provide new insights into specific neuropathologies associated with ZIKA virus infections.

TI  - Zika Virus Envelope Protein induces G2/M Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis via an Intrinsic Cell Death Signaling Pathway in Neuroendocrine PC12 Cells
JF  - International Journal of Biological Sciences
VL  - 14
SP  - 1099
EP  - 1108
AB  - Clinical evidence suggests that there exists a strong correlation between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and abnormal development of the nervous system. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elusive. In this study, recombinant lentiviral vectors coding for ZIKV structural proteins and truncations (prM-Env, M-Env and Env) were transduced into PC12 cells. Envelope (Env) overexpression induced significant inhibition of proliferation and triggered G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PC12 cells. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis showed that the apoptosis was associated with up-regulation of both p53 and p21Cip1/Waf1 and down-regulation of cyclin B1. Presence of aberrant nuclei clusters were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining analysis. The data indicate that overexpression of prM-Env, M-Env or Env led to apoptosis via an intrinsic cell death signaling pathway that is dependent on the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and accompanied by an increased ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 in transduced PC12 cells. In summary, our results suggest that ZIKV Env protein causes apoptosis in PC12 cells via an intrinsic cell death signaling pathway, which may contribute to ZIKV-induced abnormal development of the nervous system.

TI  - Zika virus evades interferon-mediated antiviral response through the co-operation of multiple nonstructural proteins in vitro
JF  - Cell Discovery
VL  - 3
AB  - Type I interferon (IFN) serves as the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Inhibition of IFN-triggered signaling cascade by Zika virus (ZIKV) plays a critical role for ZIKV to evade antiviral responses from host cells. Here we demonstrate that ZIKV nonstructural proteins NS1, NS4B and NS2B3 inhibit the induction of IFN and downstream IFN-stimulated genes through diverse strategies. NS1 and NS4B of ZIKV inhibit IFNβ signaling at TANK-binding kinase 1 level, whereas NS2B-NS3 of ZIKV impairs JAK–STAT signaling pathway by degrading Jak1 and reduces virus-induced apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, co-operation of NS1, NS4B and NS2B3 further enhances viral infection by blocking IFN-induced autophagic degradation of NS2B3. Hence, our study reveals a novel antagonistic system employing multiple ZIKV nonstructural proteins in restricting the innate antiviral responses.

TI  - Zika Virus Exhibits Lineage-Specific Phenotypes in Cell Culture, in Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes, and in an Embryo Model
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 9
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has quietly circulated in Africa and Southeast Asia for the past 65 years. However, the recent ZIKV epidemic in the Americas propelled this mosquito-borne virus to the forefront of flavivirus research. Based on historical evidence, ZIKV infections in Africa were sporadic and caused mild symptoms such as fever, skin rash, and general malaise. In contrast, recent Asian-lineage ZIKV infections in the Pacific Islands and the Americas are linked to birth defects and neurological disorders. The aim of this study is to compare replication, pathogenicity, and transmission efficiency of two historic and two contemporary ZIKV isolates in cell culture, the mosquito host, and an embryo model to determine if genetic variation between the African and Asian lineages results in phenotypic differences. While all tested isolates replicated at similar rates in Vero cells, the African isolates displayed more rapid viral replication in the mosquito C6/36 cell line, yet they exhibited poor infection rates in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes compared to the contemporary Asian-lineage isolates. All isolates could infect chicken embryos; however, infection with African isolates resulted in higher embryo mortality than infection with Asian-lineage isolates. These results suggest that genetic variation between ZIKV isolates can significantly alter experimental outcomes.

TI  - Zika virus genome biology and molecular pathogenesis
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 6
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging RNA virus in the widespread Flavivirus genus. Recently, ZIKV has rapidly spread around the world and has been implicated in human disease, including neurological disorders, triggering public and scientific attention. Understanding how ZIKV causes disease is the highest priority, yet little is known about this virus. Here we examine the currently published data from ZIKV studies to provide the latest understanding of ZIKV genome biology and molecular pathogenesis. The ZIKV genome evolved rapidly from the Flavivirus genus and diverged from the members of this genus, even within the dengue virus cluster to which ZIKV belongs. Genome variations and divergences also exist among ZIKV strains/isolates. These genome divergences might account for the uniqueness of Zika disease. ZIKV infection activates not only the antiviral immune response but also the pro-inflammatory responses associated with disease symptoms. Strikingly, ZIKV activates protein complexes that are functionally associated with disease process, such as glial cell activation and proliferation (for example, Toll-like receptors), apoptosis and cell death, and inflammation. The activation of these complexes may critically contribute to Zika disease. The novel insights into ZIKV genome divergence and disease mechanisms summarized in this review will help accelerate the development of anti-ZIKV strategies.

TI  - Zika Virus Impairs Host NLRP3-mediated Inflammasome Activation in an NS3-dependent Manner
JF  - Immune Network
VL  - 19
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus associated with severe neurological disorders including Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly. The host innate immune responses against ZIKV infection are essential for protection; however, ZIKV has evolved strategies to evade and antagonize antiviral responses via its nonstructural (NS) proteins. Here, we demonstrated that ZIKV infection unexpectedly inhibits NLRP3-dependent inflammasome activation in bone marrow-derived macrophages and mixed glial cells from mouse brain. ZIKV infection led to increased transcript levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6 via activating NF-κB signaling. However, ZIKV infection failed to trigger the secretion of active caspase-1 and IL-1β from macrophages and glial cells even in the presence of LPS priming or ATP costimulation. Intriguingly, ZIKV infection significantly attenuated NLRP3-dependent, but not absent in melanoma 2-dependent caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion from both cells. ZIKV infection further blocked apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain oligomerization in LPS/ATP-stimulated macrophages. Interestingly, expression of ZIKV NS3 protein reduced NLRP3-mediated caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in macrophages, whereas NS1 and NS5 proteins showed no effects. Furthermore, NLRP3 was found to be degraded by the overexpression of ZIKV NS3 in 293T cells. Collectively, these results indicate that ZIKV evades host NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated innate immune responses in macrophages and glial cells; this may facilitate ZIKV's ability to enhance the replication and dissemination in these cells.

TI  - Zika Virus Induces Degradation of the Numb Protein Required through Embryonic Neurogenesis
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and causes an infection associated with congenital Zika syndrome and Guillain–Barre syndrome. The mechanism of ZIKV-mediated neuropathogenesis is not well understood. In this study, we discovered that ZIKV induces degradation of the Numb protein, which plays a crucial role in neurogenesis by allowing asymmetric cell division during embryonic development. Our data show that ZIKV reduced the Numb protein level in a time- and dose-dependent manner. However, ZIKV infection appears to have minimal effect on the Numb transcript. Treatment of ZIKV-infected cells with a proteasome inhibitor restores the Numb protein level, which suggests the involvement of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. In addition, ZIKV infection shortens the half-life of the Numb protein. Among the ZIKV proteins, the capsid protein significantly reduces the Numb protein level. Immunoprecipitation of the Numb protein co-precipitates the capsid protein, indicating the interaction between these two proteins. These results provide insights into the ZIKV–cell interaction that might contribute to its impact on neurogenesis.

TI  - Zika Virus Induces Mitotic Catastrophe in Human Neural Progenitors by Triggering Unscheduled Mitotic Entry in the Presence of DNA Damage While Functionally Depleting Nuclear PNKP
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - The 2015–2017 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil and subsequent international epidemic revealed the strong association between ZIKV infection and congenital malformations, mostly neurodevelopmental defects up to microcephaly. The scale and global expansion of the epidemic, the new ZIKV outbreaks (Kerala state, India, 2021), and the potential burden of future ones pose a serious ongoing risk. ABSTRACT Vertical transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) leads with high frequency to congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS), whose worst outcome is microcephaly. However, the mechanisms of congenital ZIKV neurodevelopmental pathologies, including direct cytotoxicity to neural progenitor cells (NPC), placental insufficiency, and immune responses, remain incompletely understood. At the cellular level, microcephaly typically results from death or insufficient proliferation of NPC or cortical neurons. NPC replicate fast, requiring efficient DNA damage responses to ensure genome stability. Like congenital ZIKV infection, mutations in the polynucleotide 5′-kinase 3′-phosphatase (PNKP) gene, which encodes a critical DNA damage repair enzyme, result in recessive syndromes often characterized by congenital microcephaly with seizures (MCSZ). We thus tested whether there were any links between ZIKV and PNKP. Here, we show that two PNKP phosphatase inhibitors or PNKP knockout inhibited ZIKV replication. PNKP relocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in infected cells, colocalizing with the marker of ZIKV replication factories (RF) NS1 and resulting in functional nuclear PNKP depletion. Although infected NPC accumulated DNA damage, they failed to activate the DNA damage checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2. ZIKV also induced activation of cytoplasmic CycA/CDK1 complexes, which trigger unscheduled mitotic entry. Inhibition of CDK1 activity inhibited ZIKV replication and the formation of RF, supporting a role of cytoplasmic CycA/CDK1 in RF morphogenesis. In brief, ZIKV infection induces mitotic catastrophe resulting from unscheduled mitotic entry in the presence of DNA damage. PNKP and CycA/CDK1 are thus host factors participating in ZIKV replication in NPC, and pathogenesis to neural progenitor cells. IMPORTANCE The 2015–2017 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil and subsequent international epidemic revealed the strong association between ZIKV infection and congenital malformations, mostly neurodevelopmental defects up to microcephaly. The scale and global expansion of the epidemic, the new ZIKV outbreaks (Kerala state, India, 2021), and the potential burden of future ones pose a serious ongoing risk. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms resulting in microcephaly remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that ZIKV infection of neuronal progenitor cells results in cytoplasmic sequestration of an essential DNA repair protein itself associated with microcephaly, with the consequent accumulation of DNA damage, together with an unscheduled activation of cytoplasmic CDK1/Cyclin A complexes in the presence of DNA damage. These alterations result in mitotic catastrophe of neuronal progenitors, which would lead to a depletion of cortical neurons during development.

TI  - Zika Virus Infection Induces Acute Kidney Injury Through Activating NLRP3 Inflammasome Via Suppressing Bcl-2
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 10
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a newly emerging flavivirus that broadly exhibits in various bodily tissues and fluids, especially in the brain, and ZIKV infection often causes microcephaly. Previous studies have been reported that ZIKV can infect renal cells and can be detected in the urine samples of infected individuals. However, whether ZIKV infection causes renal diseases and its pathogenic mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we identified that ZIKV infection resulted in acute kidney injury (AKI) in both newborn and adult mouse models by increasing the levels of AKI-related biomarkers [e.g., serum creatinine (Scr), kidney injury molecular−1 (Kim-1), and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)]. ZIKV infection triggered the inflammatory response and renal cell injury by activating Nod-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and secreting interleukin-1β (IL-1β). IL-1β inhibited aquaporins expression and led to water re-absorption disorder. Furthermore, ZIKV infection induced a decreased expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in the kidney. Overexpression of Bcl-2 attenuated ZIKV-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in renal cells and down-regulated PARP/caspase-3-mediated renal apoptosis. Overall, our findings demonstrated that ZIKV infection induced AKI by activating NLRP3 inflammasome and apoptosis through suppressing Bcl-2 expression, which provided potential therapeutic targets for ZIKV-associated renal diseases.

TI  - Zika virus infection induces host inflammatory responses by facilitating NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and interleukin-1β secretion
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 9
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a public health emergency and host innate immunity is essential for the control of virus infection. The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a key role in host innate immune responses by activating caspase-1 to facilitate interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion. Here we report that ZIKV stimulates IL-1β secretion in infected patients, human PBMCs and macrophages, mice, and mice BMDCs. The knockdown of NLRP3 in cells and knockout of NLRP3 in mice inhibit ZIKV-mediated IL-1β secretion, indicating an essential role for NLRP3 in ZIKV-induced IL-1β activation. Moreover, ZIKV NS5 protein is required for NLRP3 activation and IL-1β secretion by binding with NLRP3 to facilitate the inflammasome complex assembly. Finally, ZIKV infection in mice activates IL-1β secretion, leading to inflammatory responses in the mice brain, spleen, liver, and kidney. Thus we reveal a mechanism by which ZIKV induces inflammatory responses by facilitating NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly and IL-1β activation. The NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in antiviral host responses. Here, the authors reveal that the polymerase of Zika virus binds NLRP3 to facilitate inflammasome complex assembly and induce production of IL-1β in human macrophages, human PBMCs and mice, resulting in pathogenesis in mice.

TI  - Zika Virus Infection of Human Iris Pigment Epithelial Cells
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - During recent Zika epidemics, adults infected with Zika virus (ZIKV) have developed organ-specific inflammatory complications. The most serious Zika-associated inflammatory eye disease is uveitis, which is commonly anterior in type, affecting both eyes and responding to corticosteroid eye drops. Mechanisms of Zika-associated anterior uveitis are unknown, but ZIKV has been identified in the aqueous humor of affected individuals. The iris pigment epithelium is a target cell population in viral anterior uveitis, and it acts to maintain immune privilege within the anterior eye. Interactions between ZIKV and human iris pigment epithelial cells were investigated with infectivity assays and RNA-sequencing. Primary cell isolates were prepared from eyes of 20 cadaveric donors, and infected for 24 hours with PRVABC59 strain ZIKV or incubated uninfected as control. Cytoimmunofluorescence, RT-qPCR on total cellular RNA, and focus-forming assays of culture supernatant showed cell isolates were permissive to infection, and supported replication and release of infectious ZIKV. To explore molecular responses of cell isolates to ZIKV infection at the whole transcriptome level, RNA was sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform, and results were aligned to the human GRCh38 genome. Multidimensional scaling showed clear separation between transcriptomes of infected and uninfected cell isolates. Differential expression analysis indicated a vigorous molecular response of the cell to ZIKV: 7,935 genes were differentially expressed between ZIKV-infected and uninfected cells (FDR < 0.05), and 99% of 613 genes that changed at least two-fold were up-regulated. Reactome and KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses indicated strong activation of viral recognition and defense, in addition to biosynthesis processes. A CHAT network included 6275 molecular nodes and 24 contextual hubs in the cell response to ZIKV infection. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) was the most significantly connected contextual hub. Correlation of gene expression with read counts assigned to the ZIKV genome identified a negative correlation between interferon signaling and viral load across isolates. This work represents the first investigation of mechanisms of Zika-associated anterior uveitis using an in vitro human cell model. The results suggest the iris pigment epithelium mounts a molecular response that limits intraocular pathology in most individuals.

TI  - Zika Virus Infection Results in Biochemical Changes Associated With RNA Editing, Inflammatory and Antiviral Responses in Aedes albopictus
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Rapid and significant range expansion of both the Zika virus (ZIKV) and its Aedes vector species has resulted in the declaration of ZIKV as a global health threat. Successful transmission of ZIKV by its vector requires a complex series of interactions between these entities including the establishment, replication and dissemination of the virus within the mosquito. The metabolic conditions within the mosquito tissues play a critical role in mediating the crucial processes of viral infection and replication and represent targets for prevention of virus transmission. In this study, we carried out a comprehensive metabolomic phenotyping of ZIKV infected and uninfected Ae. albopictus by untargeted analysis of primary metabolites, lipids and biogenic amines. We performed a comparative metabolomic study of infection state with the aim of understanding the biochemical changes resulting from the interaction between the ZIKV and its vector. We have demonstrated that ZIKV infection results in changes to the cellular metabolic environment including a significant enrichment of inosine and pseudo-uridine (Ψ) levels which may be associated with RNA editing activity. In addition, infected mosquitoes demonstrate a hypoglycemic phenotype and show significant increases in the abundance of metabolites such as prostaglandin H2, leukotriene D4 and protoporphyrinogen IX which are associated with antiviral activity. These provide a basis for understanding the biochemical response to ZIKV infection and pathology in the vector. Future mechanistic studies targeting these ZIKV infection responsive metabolites and their associated biosynthetic pathways can provide inroads to identification of mosquito antiviral responses with infection blocking potential.

TI  - Zika virus infects cells lining the blood-retinal barrier and causes chorioretinal atrophy in mouse eyes.
JF  - JCI insight
VL  - 2 4
SP  - e92340
EP  - 
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an important pathogen that causes not only neurologic, but also ocular, abnormalities. Thus, it is imperative that models to study ZIKV pathogenesis in the eye are developed to identify potential targets for interventions. Here, we studied ZIKV interactions with human retinal cells and evaluated ZIKV's pathobiology in mouse eyes. We showed that cells lining the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), the retinal endothelium, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) were highly permissive and susceptible to ZIKV-induced cell death. Direct inoculation of ZIKV in eyes of adult C57BL/6 and IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) KO mice caused chorioretinal atrophy with RPE mottling, a common ocular manifestation of congenital ZIKV infection in humans. This response was associated with induced expression of multiple inflammatory and antiviral (IFNs) response genes in the infected mouse retina. Interestingly, ISG15 KO eyes exhibited severe chorioretinitis, which coincided with increased retinal cell death and higher ZIKV replication. Collectively, our study provides the first evidence to our knowledge that ZIKV causes retinal lesions and infects the cells lining the BRB and that ISG15 plays a role in retinal innate defense against ZIKV infection. Our mouse model can be used to study mechanisms underlying ZIKV-induced chorioretinitis and to gauge ocular antiviral therapies.

TI  - Zika virus infects human blood mononuclear cells
JF  - BMC Infectious Diseases
VL  - 19
AB  - BackgroundZika virus (ZIKV) infection gained public health concern after the 2015 outbreak in Brazil, when microcephaly rates increased in babies born from infected mothers. It was demonstrated that ZIKV causes a congenital Zika virus syndrome, including various alterations in the development of the central nervous system. Although the infection of cells from the nervous system has been well documented, less is known in respect of ZIKV ability to infect immune cells. Herein, we investigated if peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), freshly-isolated from healthy donors, could be infected by ZIKV.MethodsPBMCs from healthy donors were isolated and cultured in medium with ZIKV strain Rio-U1 (MOI = 0.1). Infection was analyzed by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry.ResultsWe detected the ZIKV RNA in PBMCs from all donors by RT-qPCR analysis. The detection of viral antigens by flow cytometry revealed that PBMC from more than 50% the donors were infected by ZIKV, with CD3+CD4+ T cells, CD3−CD19+ B cells and CD3+CD8+ T cells being, respectively, the most frequently infected subpopulations, followed by CD14+ monocytes. Additionally, we observed high variability in PBMC infection rates among different donors, either by numbers or type infected cells.ConclusionsThese findings raise the hypothesis that PBMCs can act as a reservoir of the virus, which may facilitate viral dissemination to different organs, including immune-privileged sites.

TI  - Zika virus infects human osteoclasts and blocks differentiation and bone resorption
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 11
SP  - 1621
EP  - 1634
AB  - ABSTRACT Bone-related complications are commonly reported following arbovirus infection. These arboviruses are known to disturb bone-remodeling and induce inflammatory bone loss via increased activity of bone resorbing osteoclasts (OCs). We previously showed that Zika virus (ZIKV) could disturb the function of bone forming osteoblasts, but the susceptibility of OCs to ZIKV infection is not known. Here, we investigated the effect of ZIKV infection on osteoclastogenesis and report that infection of pre- and early OCs with ZIKV significantly reduced the osteoclast formation and bone resorption. Interestingly, infection of pre-OCs with a low dose ZIKV infection in the presence of flavivirus cross-reacting antibodies recapitulated the phenotype observed with a high viral dose, suggesting a role for antibody-dependent enhancement in ZIKV-associated bone pathology. In conclusion, we have characterized a primary in vitro model to study the role of osteoclastogenesis in ZIKV pathogenesis, which will help to identify possible new targets for developing therapeutic and preventive measures.

TI  - Zika Virus Infects Human Placental Mast Cells and the HMC-1 Cell Line, and Triggers Degranulation, Cytokine Release and Ultrastructural Changes
JF  - Cells
VL  - 9
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emergent arthropod-borne virus whose outbreak in Brazil has brought major public health problems. Infected individuals have different symptoms, including rash and pruritus, which can be relieved by the administration of antiallergics. In the case of pregnant women, ZIKV can cross the placenta and infect the fetus leading to congenital defects. We have identified that mast cells in the placentae of patients who had Zika during pregnancy can be infected. This led to our investigation on the possible role of mast cells during a ZIKV infection, using the HMC-1 cell line. We analyzed their permissiveness to infection, release of mediators and ultrastructural changes. Flow cytometry detection of ZIKV-NS1 expression 24 h post infection in 45.3% of cells showed that HMC-1 cells are permissive to ZIKV infection. Following infection, β-hexosaminidase was measured in the supernatant of the cells with a notable release at 30 min. In addition, an increase in TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and VEGF levels were measured at 6 h and 24 h post infection. Lastly, different intracellular changes were observed in an ultrastructural analysis of infected cells. Our findings suggest that mast cells may represent an important source of mediators that can activate other immune cell types during a ZIKV infection, which has the potential to be a major contributor in the spread of the virus in cases of vertical transmission.

VL  - 128

EP  - 
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a teratogenic mosquito-borne flavivirus that can be sexually transmitted from man to woman. The finding of high viral loads and prolonged viral shedding in semen suggests that ZIKV replicates within the human male genital tract, but its target organs are unknown. Using ex vivo infection of organotypic cultures, we demonstrated here that ZIKV replicates in human testicular tissue and infects a broad range of cell types, including germ cells, which we also identified as infected in semen from ZIKV-infected donors. ZIKV had no major deleterious effect on the morphology and hormonal production of the human testis explants. Infection induced a broad antiviral response but no IFN upregulation and minimal proinflammatory response in testis explants, with no cytopathic effect. Finally, we studied ZIKV infection in mouse testis and compared it to human infection. This study provides key insights into how ZIKV may persist in semen and alter semen parameters, as well as a valuable tool for testing antiviral agents.

TI  - Zika Virus Infects Intermediate Progenitor Cells and Post-mitotic Committed Neurons in Human Fetal Brain Tissues
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is associated with microcephaly in fetuses, but the pathogenesis of ZIKV-related microcephaly is not well understood. Here we show that ZIKV infects the subventricular zone in human fetal brain tissues and that the tissue tropism broadens with the progression of gestation. Our research demonstrates also that intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) are the main target cells for ZIKV. Post-mitotic committed neurons become susceptible to ZIKV infection as well at later stages of gestation. Furthermore, activation of microglial cells, DNA fragmentation, and apoptosis of infected or uninfected cells could be found in ZIKV-infected brain tissues. Our studies identify IPCs as the main target cells for ZIKV. They also suggest that immune activation after ZIKV infection may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ZIKV-related microcephaly.

TI  - Zika virus infects pericytes in the choroid plexus and enters the central nervous system through the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) can infect and cause microcephaly and Zika-associated neurological complications in the developing fetal and adult brains. In terms of pathogenesis, a critical question is how ZIKV overcomes the barriers separating the brain from the circulation and gains access to the central nervous system (CNS). Despite the importance of ZIKV pathogenesis, the route ZIKV utilizes to cross CNS barriers remains unclear. Here we show that in mouse models, ZIKV-infected cells initially appeared in the periventricular regions of the brain, including the choroid plexus and the meninges, prior to infection of the cortex. The appearance of ZIKV in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) preceded infection of the brain parenchyma. We show that ZIKV infects pericytes in the choroid plexus, and that ZIKV infection of pericytes is dependent on AXL receptor tyrosine kinase. Using an in vitro Transwell system, we highlight the possibility of ZIKV to move from the blood side to CSF side, across the choroid plexus epithelial layers, via a nondestructive pathway (e.g., transcytosis). Finally, we demonstrate that brain infection is significantly attenuated by neutralization of the virus in the CSF, indicating that ZIKV in the CSF at the early stage of infection might be responsible for establishing a lethal infection of the brain. Taken together, our results suggest that ZIKV invades the host brain by exploiting the blood-CSF barrier rather than the blood-brain barrier. AUTHOR SUMMARY Zika virus invades the human brains and causes Zika-associated neurological complications; however, the mechanism(s) by which Zika virus accesses the central nerves system remain unclear. Understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms will shed light on development of novel therapeutic and prophylactic targets for Zika virus and other neurotropic viruses. Here we use in vivo and in vitro models to understand how Zika virus enters the brain. In mouse models, we found that Zika virus infects pericytes in the choroid plexus at very early stages of infection and neutralization of Zika virus in the cerebrospinal fluid significantly attenuate the brain infection. Further we show evidence that Zika virus can cross the epithelial cell layers in the choroid plexus from the blood side. Our research highlights that ZIKV invades the host brain by exploiting the blood-CSF barrier rather than the blood-brain barrier.

TI  - Zika Virus Infects, Activates, and Crosses Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells, without Barrier Disruption
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has been associated to central nervous system (CNS) harm, and virus was detected in the brain and cerebrospinal fluids of microcephaly and meningoencephalitis cases. However, the mechanism by which the virus reaches the CNS is unclear. Here, we addressed the effects of ZIKV replication in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), as an in vitro model of blood brain barrier (BBB), and evaluated virus extravasation and BBB integrity in an in vivo mouse experimental model. HBMECs were productively infected by African and Brazilian ZIKV strains (ZIKVMR766 and ZIKVPE243), which induce increased production of type I and type III IFN, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Infection with ZIKVMR766 promoted earlier cellular death, in comparison to ZIKVPE243, but infection with either strain did not result in enhanced endothelial permeability. Despite the maintenance of endothelial integrity, infectious virus particles crossed the monolayer by endocytosis/exocytosis-dependent replication pathway or by transcytosis. Remarkably, both viruses' strains infected IFNAR deficient mice, with high viral load being detected in the brains, without BBB disruption, which was only detected at later time points after infection. These data suggest that ZIKV infects and activates endothelial cells, and might reach the CNS through basolateral release, transcytosis or transinfection processes. These findings further improve the current knowledge regarding ZIKV dissemination pathways.

TI  - Zika virus inhibits cell death by inhibiting the expression of NLRP3 and A20
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 99
AB  - ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with microcephaly in neonates and neurological disorders in adults. Chronic ZIKV infection has been identified in the testes, indicating that the virus can lead to prolonged illness, yet its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we found that ZIKV infection does not induce significant cell death in mouse macrophages despite the critical role that cell death plays in the antiviral immune response. Furthermore, we discovered that ZIKV infection impairs the activation of the NLPR3-dependent inflammasome and inhibits apoptosis. Consequently, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome and apoptosis in the context of ZIKV infection. Our results revealed significant reductions in the protein expression levels of NLRP3 and A20, attributable to post-transcriptional or translational effects during ZIKV infection. These findings suggest that ZIKV infection may disrupt cell death pathways, leading to its pathogenicity. IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV), first isolated from a nonhuman primate in Africa in 1947, was relatively understudied until 2016. By then, ZIKV had already been reported in more than 20 countries and territories. The infection poses a significant risk, as it is associated with microcephaly in infants and neurological disorders in adults; however, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these severe outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that ZIKV infection significantly reduces the expression of NLRP3 and A20 proteins through post-transcriptional or translational processes, which leads to inhibited cell death. These findings are critical because cell death plays a vital role in the host's antiviral immune response. Our findings highlight how ZIKV infection compromises essential cell death pathways, raising serious concerns about its pathogenesis. A comprehensive understanding of this disruption is vital for developing targeted interventions to mitigate the virus' impact on public health. Zika virus (ZIKV), first isolated from a nonhuman primate in Africa in 1947, was relatively understudied until 2016. By then, ZIKV had already been reported in more than 20 countries and territories. The infection poses a significant risk, as it is associated with microcephaly in infants and neurological disorders in adults; however, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these severe outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that ZIKV infection significantly reduces the expression of NLRP3 and A20 proteins through post-transcriptional or translational processes, which leads to inhibited cell death. These findings are critical because cell death plays a vital role in the host's antiviral immune response. Our findings highlight how ZIKV infection compromises essential cell death pathways, raising serious concerns about its pathogenesis. A comprehensive understanding of this disruption is vital for developing targeted interventions to mitigate the virus' impact on public health.

TI  - Zika virus M protein latches and locks the E protein from transitioning to an immature state after prM cleavage
JF  - npj Viruses
VL  - 1
AB  - During flavivirus maturation, the structural proteins prM (pre-membrane) and E (envelope) undergo extensive low pH-mediated conformational changes, transitioning from spiky trimeric to smooth dimeric prM/E heterodimers which allow for furin cleavage of prM into pr and M and forms the irreversible mature conformation of smooth M/E heterodimers. The mechanisms of irreversible conformational changes to E protein following the pr cleavage are not understood. Utilizing cryo-EM structures of immature virus and structure-based mutagenesis of Zika virus, we identified two critical “latching and locking” interactions mediated by M protein residues Arg38 and Trp19, respectively, that stabilize the E protein structure in the smooth mature stage. M protein thus latches and locks the E protein in an irreversible mature structure, preventing premature fusion in the secretory pathway. Our studies provide mechanistic insights into the reversible structural transition of immature trimeric spikes and the irreversible transition of smooth dimeric M/E heterodimers critical for virus infectivity.

TI  - Zika Virus Neuropathogenesis: The Different Brain Cells, Host Factors and Mechanisms Involved
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), despite being discovered six decades earlier, became a major health concern only after an epidemic in French Polynesia and an increase in the number of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Substantial evidence has been found to support the link between ZIKV and neurological complications in infants. The virus targets various cells in the brain, including radial glial cells, neural progenitor cells (NPCs), astrocytes, microglial and glioblastoma stem cells. It affects the brain cells by exploiting different mechanisms, mainly through apoptosis and cell cycle dysregulation. The modulation of host immune response and the inflammatory process has also been demonstrated to play a critical role in ZIKV induced neurological complications. In addition to that, different ZIKV strains have exhibited specific neurotropism and unique molecular mechanisms. This review provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of ZIKV-induced neuroimmunopathogenesis by dissecting its main target cells in the brain, and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. We highlighted the roles of the different ZIKV host factors and how they exploit specific host factors through various mechanisms. Overall, it covers key components for understanding the crosstalk between ZIKV and the brain.

TI  - Zika Virus Neuropathogenesis—Research and Understanding
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is prominently associated with microcephaly in babies born to infected mothers as well as Guillain-Barré Syndrome in adults. Each cell type infected by ZIKV—neuronal cells (radial glial cells, neuronal progenitor cells, astrocytes, microglia cells, and glioblastoma stem cells) and non-neuronal cells (primary fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, and Sertoli cells)—displays its own characteristic changes to their cell physiology and has various impacts on disease. Here, we provide an in-depth review of the ZIKV life cycle and its cellular targets, and discuss the current knowledge of how infections cause neuropathologies, as well as what approaches researchers are currently taking to further advance such knowledge. A key aspect of ZIKV neuropathogenesis is virus-induced neuronal apoptosis via numerous mechanisms including cell cycle dysregulation, mitochondrial fragmentation, ER stress, and the unfolded protein response. These, in turn, result in the activation of p53-mediated intrinsic cell death pathways. A full spectrum of infection models including stem cells and co-cultures, transwells to simulate blood–tissue barriers, brain-region-specific organoids, and animal models have been developed for ZIKV research.

TI  - Zika virus non-coding RNAs antagonize antiviral responses by PKR-mediated translational arrest
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 52
SP  - 11128
EP  - 11147
AB  - Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes severe outbreaks in human populations. ZIKV infection leads to the accumulation of small non-coding viral RNAs (known as sfRNAs) that are crucial for evasion of antiviral responses and for viral pathogenesis. However, the mechanistic understanding of how sfRNAs function remains incomplete. Here, we use recombinant ZIKVs and ribosome profiling of infected human cells to show that sfRNAs block translation of antiviral genes. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that specific RNA structures present in sfRNAs trigger PKR activation, which instead of limiting viral replication, enhances viral particle production. Although ZIKV infection induces mRNA expression of antiviral genes, translation efficiency of type I interferon and interferon stimulated genes were significantly downregulated by PKR activation. Our results reveal a novel viral adaptation mechanism mediated by sfRNAs, where ZIKV increases its fitness by repurposing the antiviral role of PKR into a proviral factor.

TI  - Zika Virus Non-Structural Protein 1 Disrupts Glycosaminoglycans and Causes Permeability in Developing Human Placentas.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
AB  - BACKGROUND
During pregnancy, the Zika flavivirus (ZIKV) infects human placentas, inducing defects in the developing fetus. The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) alters glycosaminoglycans on the endothelium, causing hyperpermeability in vitro and vascular leakage in vivo in a tissue-dependent manner. The contribution of ZIKV NS1 to placental dysfunction during ZIKV infection remains unknown.


METHODS
We examined the effect of ZIKV NS1 on expression and release of heparan sulfate (HS), hyaluronic acid (HA), and sialic acid (Sia) on human trophoblast cell lines and anchoring villous explants from first-trimester placentas infected with ZIKV ex vivo. We measured changes in permeability in trophoblasts and stromal cores using a dextran-based fluorescence assay and changes in HA receptor expression using immunofluorescent microscopy.


RESULTS
ZIKV NS1 in the presence and absence of ZIKV increased the permeability of anchoring villous explants. ZIKV NS1 induced shedding of HA and HS and altered expression of CD44 and LYVE-1 HA receptors on stromal fibroblasts and Hofbauer macrophages in villous cores. Hyaluronidase was also stimulated in NS1-treated trophoblasts.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that ZIKV NS1 contributes to placental dysfunction via modulation of glycosaminoglycans on trophoblasts and chorionic villi, resulting in increased permeability of human placentas.

TI  - Zika Virus Non-structural Protein 4A Blocks the RLR-MAVS Signaling
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 9
AB  - Flaviviruses have evolved complex mechanisms to evade the mammalian host immune systems including the RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) like receptor (RLR) signaling. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging flavivirus that is associated with severe neonatal microcephaly and adult Guillain-Barre syndrome. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ZIKV pathogenesis remain poorly defined. Here we report that ZIKV non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) impairs the RLR-mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) interaction and subsequent induction of antiviral immune responses. In human trophoblasts, both RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) contribute to type I interferon (IFN) induction and control ZIKV replication. Type I IFN induction by ZIKV is almost completely abolished in MAVS-/- cells. NS4A represses RLR-, but not Toll-like receptor-mediated immune responses. NS4A specifically binds the N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) of MAVS and thus blocks its accessibility by RLRs. Our study provides in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms of immune evasion by ZIKV and its pathogenesis.

TI  - Zika virus non-structural protein NS4A restricts eye growth in Drosophila through regulation of JAK/STAT signaling
JF  - Disease Models & Mechanisms
VL  - 13
AB  - ABSTRACT To gain a comprehensive view of the changes in host gene expression underlying Zika virus (ZIKV) pathogenesis, we performed whole-genome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of ZIKV-infected Drosophila adult flies. RNA-seq analysis revealed that ZIKV infection alters several and diverse biological processes, including stress, locomotion, lipid metabolism, imaginal disc morphogenesis and regulation of JAK/STAT signaling. To explore the interaction between ZIKV infection and JAK/STAT signaling regulation, we generated genetic constructs overexpressing ZIKV-specific non-structural proteins NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B. We found that ectopic expression of non-structural proteins in the developing Drosophila eye significantly restricts growth of the larval and adult eye and correlates with considerable repression of the in vivo JAK/STAT reporter, 10XStat92E-GFP. At the cellular level, eye growth defects are associated with reduced rate of proliferation without affecting the overall rate of apoptosis. In addition, ZIKV NS4A genetically interacts with the JAK/STAT signaling components; co-expression of NS4A along with the dominant-negative form of domeless or StatRNAi results in aggravated reduction in eye size, while co-expression of NS4A in HopTuml (also known as hopTum) mutant background partially rescues the hop-induced eye overgrowth phenotype. The function of ZIKV NS4A in regulating growth is maintained in the wing, where ZIKV NS4A overexpression in the pouch domain results in reduced growth linked with diminished expression of Notch targets, Wingless (Wg) and Cut, and the Notch reporter, NRE-GFP. Thus, our study provides evidence that ZIKV infection in Drosophila results in restricted growth of the developing eye and wing, wherein eye phenotype is induced through regulation of JAK/STAT signaling, whereas restricted wing growth is induced through regulation of Notch signaling. The interaction of ZIKV non-structural proteins with the conserved host signaling pathways further advance our understanding of ZIKV-induced pathogenesis. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper. Summary: Our study provides evidence that Zika virus infection in Drosophila results in restricted growth of the developing eye and wing through regulation of JAK/STAT and Notch signaling, respectively.

TI  - Zika Virus Non-Structural Protein NS5 Inhibits the RIG-I Pathway and Interferon Lambda 1 Promoter Activation by Targeting IKK Epsilon
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family and an important human pathogen. Most pathogenic viruses encode proteins that interfere with the activation of host innate immune responses. Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV interferes with the expression of interferon (IFN) genes and inhibits IFN-induced antiviral responses. ZIKV infects through epithelial barriers where IFN-λ1 is an important antiviral molecule. In this study, we analyzed the effects of ZIKV proteins on the activation of IFN-λ1 promoter. All ZIKV proteins were cloned and transiently expressed. ZIKV NS5, but no other ZIKV protein, was able to interfere with the RIG-I signaling pathway. This inhibition took place upstream of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) resulting in reduced phosphorylation of IRF3 and reduced activation of IFN-λ1 promoter. Furthermore, we showed that ZIKV NS5 interacts with the protein kinase IKKε, which is likely critical to the observed inhibition of phosphorylation of IRF3.

TI  - Zika virus noncoding RNA cooperates with the viral protein NS5 to inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation and facilitate viral pathogenesis
JF  - Science Advances
VL  - 8
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging pathogenic flavivirus, which causes microcephaly in infants and poses a continuing threat to public health. ZIKV, like all other flaviviruses, produces highly abundant noncoding RNA known as subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA). Herein we utilized wild-type and mutant ZIKV defective in production of sfRNA to elucidate for the first time how production of sfRNA affects all aspects of ZIKV pathogenesis. We found that in mouse pregnancy model of infection sfRNA is required for trans-placental dissemination of ZIKV and subsequent infection of fetal brain. Using human brain organoids, we showed that sfRNA promotes apoptosis of neural progenitor cells leading to profound cytopathicity and disintegration of organoids. We also found by transcriptome profiling and gene network analysis that in infected human placental cells sfRNA inhibits multiple antiviral pathways and promotes apoptosis with STAT1 identified as a key shared factor linking these two interconnected sfRNA activities. We further showed for the first time that sfRNA inhibits phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 by a novel mechanism which involves binding to and stabilizing viral protein NS5. This allows accumulation of NS5 at the levels required for efficient inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation. Thus, we elucidated the molecular mechanism by which ZIKV sfRNA exerts its functions in vertebrate hosts and discovered a co-operation between viral noncoding RNA and a viral protein as a novel strategy employed by viruses to counteract antiviral responses.

TI  - Zika virus noncoding RNA suppresses apoptosis and is required for virus transmission by mosquitoes
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 11
AB  - Flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), utilise host mRNA degradation machinery to produce subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA). In mammalian hosts, this noncoding RNA facilitates replication and pathogenesis of flaviviruses by inhibiting IFN-signalling, whereas the function of sfRNA in mosquitoes remains largely elusive. Herein, we conduct a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments to define the role of ZIKV sfRNA in infected Aedes aegypti employing viruses deficient in production of sfRNA. We show that sfRNA-deficient viruses have reduced ability to disseminate and reach saliva, thus implicating the role for sfRNA in productive infection and transmission. We also demonstrate that production of sfRNA alters the expression of mosquito genes related to cell death pathways, and prevents apoptosis in mosquito tissues. Inhibition of apoptosis restored replication and transmission of sfRNA-deficient mutants. Hence, we propose anti-apoptotic activity of sfRNA as the mechanism defining its role in ZIKV transmission. The function on subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) in the mosquito vector is not well understood. Here, Slonchak et al. show that sfRNA affects virus-induced apoptosis and dissemination of ZIKV in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, suggesting a role of sfRNA in Zika virus replication and transmission.

TI  - Zika virus noncoding sfRNAs sequester multiple host-derived RNA-binding proteins and modulate mRNA decay and splicing during infection
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 294
SP  - 16282
EP  - 16296
AB  - Insect-borne flaviviruses produce a 300–500–base long noncoding RNA, termed subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), by stalling the cellular 5′–3′-exoribonuclease 1 (XRN1) via structures located in their 3′ UTRs. In this study, we demonstrate that sfRNA production by Zika virus represses XRN1 analogous to what we have previously shown for other flaviviruses. Using protein–RNA reconstitution and a stringent RNA pulldown assay with human choriocarcinoma (JAR) cells, we demonstrate that the sfRNAs from both dengue type 2 and Zika viruses interact with a common set of 21 RNA-binding proteins that contribute to the regulation of post-transcriptional processes in the cell, including splicing, RNA stability, and translation. We found that four of these sfRNA-interacting host proteins, DEAD-box helicase 6 (DDX6) and enhancer of mRNA decapping 3 (EDC3) (two RNA decay factors), phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export (a regulator of the biogenesis of the splicing machinery), and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3C (APOBEC3C, a nucleic acid–editing deaminase), inherently restrict Zika virus infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the regulations of cellular mRNA decay and RNA splicing are compromised by Zika virus infection as well as by sfRNA alone. Collectively, these results reveal the large extent to which Zika virus–derived sfRNAs interact with cellular RNA-binding proteins and highlight the potential for widespread dysregulation of post-transcriptional control that likely limits the effective response of these cells to viral infection.

TI  - Zika virus nonstructural protein 5 residue R681 is critical for dimer formation and enzymatic activity
JF  - FEBS Letters
VL  - 593
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) relies on its nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) for capping and synthesis of the viral RNA. Recent small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS) data of recombinant ZIKV NS5 protein showed that it is dimeric in solution. Here, we present insights into the critical residues responsible for its dimer formation. SAXS studies of the engineered ZIKV NS5 mutants revealed that R681A mutation on NS5 (NS5R681A) disrupts the dimer formation and affects its RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase activity as well as the subcellular localization of NS5R681A in mammalian cells. The critical residues involved in the dimer arrangement of ZIKV NS5 are discussed, and the data provide further insights into the diversity of flaviviral NS5 proteins in terms of their propensity for oligomerization.

TI  - Zika virus NS1 drives tunneling nanotube formation for mitochondrial transfer and stealth transmission in trophoblasts
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 16
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is unique among orthoflaviviruses in its vertical transmission capacity in humans, yet the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that ZIKV induces tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) in placental trophoblasts which facilitate transfer of viral particles, proteins, mitochondria, and RNA to neighboring uninfected cells. TNT formation is driven exclusively via ZIKV non-structural protein 1 (NS1). Specifically, the N-terminal 1-50 amino acids of membrane-bound ZIKV NS1 are necessary for triggering TNT formation in host cells. Trophoblasts infected with TNT-deficient ZIKVΔTNT mutant virus elicited a robust antiviral IFN-λ 1/2/3 response relative to WT ZIKV, suggesting TNT-mediated trafficking allows ZIKV cell-to-cell transmission camouflaged from host defenses. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry of cells expressing wild-type NS1 or non-TNT forming NS1, we found mitochondrial proteins are dominant NS1-interacting partners. We demonstrate that ZIKV infection or NS1 expression induces elevated mitochondria levels in trophoblasts and that mitochondria are siphoned via TNTs from healthy to ZIKV-infected cells. Together our findings identify a stealth mechanism that ZIKV employs for intercellular spread among placental trophoblasts, evasion of antiviral interferon response, and the hijacking of mitochondria to augment its propagation and survival and offers a basis for novel therapeutic developments targeting these interactions to limit ZIKV dissemination.

TI  - Zika virus NS2A and NS4A are the major antagonists that reduce IFN-β promoter activity induced by the MDA5/RIG-I signaling pathway.
JF  - Journal of microbiology and biotechnology
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted emerging Flavivirus causing the Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly in adults and fetuses, respectively. Since ZIKV was first isolated in 1947, severe outbreaks have occurred at various places worldwide, including in the Yap Island in 2007, in the French Polynesia in 2013, and in Brazil in 2015. Although incidences of ZIKV infection and dissemination have drastically increased, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of ZIKV and ZIKV related-diseases have not been sufficiently studied. In addition, despite extensive research, the exact roles of individual ZIKV genes on the viral evasion of host innate immune responses remain elusive. Besides, it is still possible that more than one ZIKV-encoded protein may negatively affect type I interferon (IFN) induction. Hence, in this study, we aimed to determine the modulations of the IFN promoter activity, induced by the MDA5/RIG-I signaling pathway, by over-expressing individual ZIKV genes. Our results show that two nonstructural proteins, NS2A and NS4A, significantly down-regulated the promoter activity of IFN-β by inhibiting multiple signaling molecules involved in the activation of IFN-β. Interestingly, while NS2A suppressed both full-length and constitutively active RIG-I, NS4A had inhibitory activity only on full-length RIG-I. In addition, while NS2A inhibited all forms of IRF3 (full-length, regulatory domain-deficient, and constitutively active), NS4A could not inhibit constitutively active IRF3-5D. Taken together, our results showed that NS2A and NS4A play major roles as antagonists of MDA5/RIG-I-mediated IFN-β induction and more importantly, those two viral proteins seem to inhibit induction of type I IFN responses in differential mechanisms. We believe this study expands our understanding regarding the mechanisms via which ZIKV controls innate immune responses and may pave way to development of ZIKV-specific therapeutics.

TI  - Zika virus NS2A inhibits interferon signaling by degradation of STAT1 and STAT2
JF  - Virulence
VL  - 12
SP  - 1580
EP  - 1596
AB  - ABSTRACT The Interferon (IFN) response is crucial to restrain pathogenic infections. Investigations into flavivirus-host interactions reported that the high virulence is linked to innate immune evasion. Zika Virus (ZIKV) has developed diversified strategies to evade the innate immune system. We report that the viral protein NS2A counteracts the IFN response by strongly suppressing the IFN signaling. NS2A targets transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2, to impede their nuclear localization, thereby suppressing the transcription of ISRE promoter and IFN-stimulated genes. We found that NS2A promotes degradation of STAT1 and STAT2. Treatment of NS2A transfected cells with MG132 restores the levels of both transcription factors, suggesting the involvement of the proteasome system. Given the impact that the IFN antagonism has on flavivirus virulence, the knowledge gained by characterizing the mechanism through which ZIKV evades the IFN response paves the ground for new strategies to attenuate the pathogenesis and to develop countermeasures against effective pharmacological targets.

TI  - Zika virus NS2A protein induces the degradation of KPNA2 (karyopherin subunit alpha 2) via chaperone-mediated autophagy
JF  - Autophagy
VL  - 16
SP  - 2238
EP  - 2251
AB  - Summary KPNA2/importin-alpha1 (karyopherin subunit alpha 2) is the primary nucleocytoplasmic transporter for some transcription factors to activate cellular proliferation and differentiation. Aberrant increase of KPNA2 level is identified as a prognostic marker in a variety of cancers. Yet, the turnover mechanism of KPNA2 remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that KPNA2 is degraded via the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) and that Zika virus (ZIKV) enhances the KPNA2 degradation. KPNA2 contains a CMA motif, which possesses an indispensable residue Gln109 for the CMA-mediated degradation. RNAi-mediated knockdown of LAMP2A, a vital component of the CMA pathway, led to a higher level of KPNA2. Moreover, ZIKV reduced KPNA2 via the viral NS2A protein, which contains an essential residue Thr100 for inducing the CMA-mediated KPNA2 degradation. Notably, mutant ZIKV with T100A alteration in NS2A replicates much weaker than the wild-type virus. Also, knockdown of KPNA2 led to a higher ZIKV viral yield, which indicates that KPNA2 mediates certain antiviral effects. These data provide insights into the KPNA2 turnover and the ZIKV-cell interactions.

TI  - Zika Virus NS2A-Mediated Virion Assembly
JF  - mBio
VL  - 10
AB  - ZIKV is a recently emerged mosquito-borne flavivirus that can cause devastating congenital Zika syndrome in pregnant women and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. The molecular mechanism of ZIKV virion assembly is largely unknown. Here, we report that ZIKV NS2A plays a central role in recruiting viral RNA, structural protein prM/E, and viral NS2B/NS3 protease to the virion assembly site and orchestrating virion morphogenesis. One mutation that impairs these interactions does not significantly affect viral RNA replication but selectively abolishes virion assembly, demonstrating the specific role of these interactions in virus morphogenesis. We also show that the 3ʹ UTR of ZIKV RNA may serve as a “recruitment signal” through binding to NS2A to enter the virion assembly site. Following a coordinated cleavage of C-prM-E at the virion assembly site, NS2A may present the viral RNA to C protein for nucleocapsid formation followed by envelopment with prM/E proteins. The results have provided new insights into flavivirus virion assembly. ABSTRACT The flavivirus virion consists of an envelope outer layer, formed by envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins on a lipid bilayer, and an internal core, formed by capsid (C) protein and genomic RNA. The molecular mechanism of flavivirus assembly is not well understood. Here, we show that Zika virus (ZIKV) NS2A protein recruits genomic RNA, the structural protein prM/E complex, and the NS2B/NS3 protease complex to the virion assembly site and orchestrates virus morphogenesis. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that ZIKV NS2A binds to prM, E, NS2B, and NS3 (but not C, NS4B, or NS5) in a viral RNA-independent manner, whereas prM/E complex does not interact with NS2B/NS3 complex. Remarkably, a single-amino-acid mutation (E103A) of NS2A impairs its binding to prM/E and NS2B/NS3 and abolishes virus production, demonstrating the indispensable role of NS2A/prM/E and NS2A/NS2B/NS3 interactions in virion assembly. In addition, RNA-protein pulldown analysis identified a stem-loop RNA from the 3ʹ untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome as an “RNA recruitment signal” for ZIKV assembly. The 3ʹ UTR RNA binds to a cytoplasmic loop of NS2A protein. Mutations of two positively charged residues (R96A and R102A) from the cytoplasmic loop reduce NS2A binding to viral RNA, leading to a complete loss of virion assembly. Collectively, our results support a virion assembly model in which NS2A recruits viral NS2B/NS3 protease and structural C-prM-E polyprotein to the virion assembly site; once the C-prM-E polyprotein has been processed, NS2A presents viral RNA to the structural proteins for virion assembly. IMPORTANCE ZIKV is a recently emerged mosquito-borne flavivirus that can cause devastating congenital Zika syndrome in pregnant women and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults.

TI  - Zika virus NS3 drives the assembly of a viroplasm-like structure
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that caused an epidemic in 2015-2016 in the Americas and raised serious global health concerns due to its association with congenital brain developmental defects in infected pregnancies. Upon infection, ZIKV assembles virus particles in a virus-generated toroidal compartment next to the nucleus called the replication factory, or viroplasm, which forms by remodeling the host cell endoplasmic reticulum (ER). How the viral proteins control viroplasm assembly remains unknown. Here we show that the ZIKV non-structural protein 3 (NS3) is sufficient to drive the assembly of a viroplasm-like structure (VLS) in human cells. NS3 encodes a dual-function protease and RNA helicase. The VLS is similar to the ZIKV viroplasm in its assembly near centrosomes at the nuclear periphery, its deformation of the nuclear membrane, its recruitment of ER, Golgi, and dsRNA, and its association with microtubules at its surface. While sufficient to generate a VLS, NS3 is less efficient in several aspects compared to viroplasm formation upon ZIKV infection. We further show that the helicase domain and not the protease domain is required for optimal VLS assembly and dsRNA recruitment. Overall, this work advances our understanding of the mechanism of viroplasm assembly by ZIKV and likely will extend to other flaviviruses. Importance The Zika virus replicates its genome and assembles virus particles in the cytoplasm within the replication organelle, a large virus-induced compartment also called the viroplasm. It does this in part by remodeling the endoplasmic reticulum. However, how the virus directs the host cell to assemble the viroplasm is mostly unknown. This study shows that Zika virus non-structural protein 3 (NS3) is sufficient to assemble a viroplasm-like structures, and indicates that NS3 has a central role in assembling the viroplasm. Understanding how the virus assembles the viroplasm compartment and NS3’s role in it should significantly advance our understanding of the cellular mechanisms of virus infection. This study aims to gain more understanding of the Zika virus and its viroplasm along with the molecular mechanisms for viroplasm assembly which might be shared by other viruses.

TI  - Zika virus NS3 is a canonical RNA helicase stimulated by NS5 RNA polymerase
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 47
SP  - 8693
EP  - 8707
AB  - Abstract Zika virus is a positive single-strand RNA virus whose replication involved RNA unwinding and synthesis. ZIKV NS3 contains a helicase domain, but its enzymatic activity is not fully characterized. Here, we established a dsRNA unwinding assay based on the FRET effect to study the helicase activity of ZIKV NS3, which provided kinetic information in real time. We found that ZIKV NS3 specifically unwound dsRNA/dsDNA with a 3′ overhang in the 3′ to 5′ direction. The RNA unwinding ability of NS3 significantly decreased when the duplex was longer than 18 base pairs. The helicase activity of NS3 depends on ATP hydrolysis and binding to RNA. Mutations in the ATP binding region or the RNA binding region of NS3 impair its helicase activity, thus blocking viral replication in the cell. Furthermore, we showed that ZIKV NS5 interacted with NS3 and stimulated its helicase activity. Disrupting NS3-NS5 interaction resulted in a defect in viral replication, revealing the tight coupling of RNA unwinding and synthesis. We suggest that NS3 helicase activity is stimulated by NS5; thus, viral replication can be carried out efficiently. Our work provides a molecular mechanism of ZIKV NS3 unwinding and novel insights into ZIKV replication.

TI  - Zika virus NS3 protease and its cellular substrates
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Zika virus is a flavivirus discovered in 1947, but the association between Zika virus infection and brain disorders was not demonstrated until 2015 in Brazil. Infection mostly poses a threat to women during pregnancy, since it may cause microcephaly and other neurological dysfunctions in the developing fetus. However, infection is also associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. The nonstructural NS3 protein is essential for virus replication because it helps to remodel the cellular microenvironment. Several reports show that this protease can process cellular substrates and thereby modify cellular pathways that are important for the virus. Herein, we explored some of the targets of NS3, but we could not confirm the biological relevance of its protease activity. Thus, although mass spectrometry is highly sensitive and useful in many instances, being also able to show directions, where cell/virus interaction occurs, we believe that biological validation of the observed results is essential.

TI  - Zika virus NS3 protease induces bone morphogenetic protein-dependent brain calcification in human fetuses
JF  - Nature microbiology
VL  - 6
SP  - 455
EP  - 466
AB  - The most frequent fetal birth defect associated with prenatal Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is brain calcification, which in turn may potentially affect neurological development in infants. Understanding the mechanism could inform the development of potential therapies against prenatal ZIKV brain calcification. In perivascular cells, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) is an osteogenic factor that undergoes maturation to activate osteogenesis and calcification. Here, we show that ZIKV infection of cultivated primary human brain pericytes triggers BMP2 maturation, leading to osteogenic gene expression and calcification. We observed extensive calcification near ZIKV+ pericytes of fetal human brain specimens and in vertically transmitted ZIKV+ human signal transducer and activator of transcription 2-knockin mouse pup brains. ZIKV infection of primary pericytes stimulated BMP2 maturation, inducing osteogenic gene expression and calcification that were completely blocked by anti-BMP2/4 neutralizing antibody. Not only did ZIKV NS3 expression alone induce BMP2 maturation, osteogenic gene expression and calcification, but purified NS3 protease also effectively cleaved pro-BMP2 in vitro to generate biologically active mature BMP2. These findings highlight ZIKV-induced calcification where the NS3 protease subverts the BMP2-mediated osteogenic signalling pathway to trigger brain calcification. Zika virus infection of human brain pericytes triggers maturation of an osteogenic factor, thereby resulting in osteogenic gene expression and calcification.

TI  - Zika virus NS4A hijacks host ANKLE2 to promote viral replication
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is infamous among flaviviruses for its unique association with congenital birth defects, notably microcephaly. We previously mapped ZIKV-host protein interactions and identified the interaction between ZIKV NS4A and host ANKLE2, which itself has established ties to congenital microcephaly. In fruit flies, NS4A induces microcephaly phenotypes in an ANKLE2-dependent manner. This suggests that NS4A interacts with ANKLE2 to dysregulate cell behavior and contributes to abnormal host neurodevelopment. Here, we explore the role of ANKLE2 in ZIKV replication to understand the biological significance of the interaction from the viral perspective. We show that knockdown of ANKLE2 reduces replication of two ZIKV strains, across multiple MOIs and timepoints. We observe that localization of ANKLE2 is drastically shifted to sites of NS4A accumulation during infection. We investigate which domains of ANKLE2 mediate this behavior and the interaction with NS4A. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we show that deletion of either the transmembrane or LEM domain has little impact on the interaction, but deletion of both significantly reduces interaction with NS4A. We show that the C-terminal transmembrane domains of NS4A stabilize the interaction with ANKLE2. Finally, we explore this interaction in other flaviviruses and observe ANKLE2 interacts with NS4A across four additional mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Together, these results suggest NS4A interacts with ANKLE2 through a combination of its transmembrane and LEM domains, bringing it to sites of ZIKV replication to promote replication through an unknown mechanism. Taken together with our previous results, our findings indicate that, in the process of hijacking ANKLE2 for replication, ZIKV disrupts its physiological function to cause disease. Importance The ZIKV epidemic led to the astonishing revelation that congenital ZIKV infection is associated with devastating birth defects, including microcephaly. Microcephaly is the condition in which head and brain size are severely reduced, and is often accompanied by intellectual disability. The molecular mechanisms by which ZIKV replicates and causes microcephaly are still incompletely understood. We previously identified the protein interaction between ZIKV NS4A and host ANKLE2, which is associated with congenital microcephaly. In flies, NS4A induces microcephaly in an ANKLE2-dependent manner, suggesting this interaction is crucial for ZIKV pathogenesis. Here, we explore the relevance of this physical interaction for virus replication. We find that ANKLE2 promotes ZIKV replication, concentrates at sites of NS4A accumulation during infection, and interacts with NS4A via its N-terminal domain. Thus, this represents a rare example of a ZIKV-host protein interaction that impacts both disease and virus replication.

TI  - Zika Virus NS5 Forms Supramolecular Nuclear Bodies That Sequester Importin-α and Modulate the Host Immune and Pro-Inflammatory Response in Neuronal Cells.
JF  - ACS infectious diseases
VL  - 5 6
SP  - 932
EP  - 948
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas was alarming because of its link with microcephaly in neonates and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. The unusual pathologies induced by ZIKV infection and the knowledge that the flaviviral nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), the most conserved protein in the flavivirus proteome, can modulate the host immune response during ZIKV infection prompted us to investigate the subcellular localization of NS5 during ZIKV infection and explore its functional significance. A monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence within ZIKV NS5 was predicted by the cNLS Mapper program, and we observed localization of ZIKV NS5 in the nucleus of infected cells by immunostaining with specific antibodies. Strikingly, ZIKV NS5 forms spherical shell-like nuclear bodies that exclude DNA. The putative monopartite NLS 390KRPR393 is necessary to direct FLAG-tagged NS5 to the nucleus as the NS5 390ARPA393 mutant protein accumulates in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, coimmunostaining experiments reveal that NS5 localizes with and sequesters importin-α, but not importin-β, in the observed nuclear bodies during virus infection. Structural and biochemical data demonstrate binding of ZIKV NS5 with importin-α and reveal important binding determinants required for their interaction and formation of complexes that give rise to the supramolecular nuclear bodies. Significantly, we demonstrate a neuronal-specific activation of the host immune response to ZIKV infection and a possible role of ZIKV NS5's nuclear localization toward this activation. This suggests that ZIKV pathogenesis may arise from a tissue-specific host response to ZIKV infection.

TI  - Zika virus NS5 protein inhibits type I interferon signaling via CRL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated degradation of STAT2
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 121
AB  - Significance The ZIKA virus (ZIKV) subverts the innate immune response by degrading STAT2 via NS5 protein, crucial for evading antiviral defenses. However, the precise mechanism has remained elusive. Here, we elucidated ZSWIM8 as the substrate receptor of the Cullin3-RING E3 ligase complex essential for NS5-mediated STAT2 degradation. Depletion of ZSWIM8 confers partial resistance to ZIKV infection in A549 cells, reducing ZIKV-induced cytopathic effects. Notably, in neural progenitor cells, ZSWIM8 depletion enhances interferon signaling, owing to sustained STAT2 levels, thereby inhibiting ZIKV infection. Our findings offer unique insights into the interplay of ZIKV and host, particularly the role of NS5 in manipulating the ZSWIM8–CUL3 E3 ligase complex to orchestrate STAT2 degradation, with implications for developing antiviral strategies and prophylactic interventions.

TI  - Zika Virus Pathogenesis: A Battle for Immune Evasion
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 9
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and its associated congenital and other neurological disorders, particularly microcephaly and other fetal developmental abnormalities, constitute a World Health Organization (WHO) Zika Virus Research Agenda within the WHO’s R&D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics, and continue to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) today. ZIKV pathogenicity is initiated by viral infection and propagation across multiple placental and fetal tissue barriers, and is critically strengthened by subverting host immunity. ZIKV immune evasion involves viral non-structural proteins, genomic and non-coding RNA and microRNA (miRNA) to modulate interferon (IFN) signaling and production, interfering with intracellular signal pathways and autophagy, and promoting cellular environment changes together with secretion of cellular components to escape innate and adaptive immunity and further infect privileged immune organs/tissues such as the placenta and eyes. This review includes a description of recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying ZIKV immune modulation and evasion that strongly condition viral pathogenesis, which would certainly contribute to the development of anti-ZIKV strategies, drugs, and vaccines.

TI  - Zika virus prM protein contains cholesterol binding motifs required for virus entry and assembly
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 14
AB  - For successful infection of host cells and virion production, enveloped viruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), extensively rely on cellular lipids. However, how virus protein–lipid interactions contribute to the viral life cycle remains unclear. Here, we employ a chemo-proteomics approach with a bifunctional cholesterol probe and show that cholesterol is closely associated with the ZIKV structural protein prM. Bioinformatic analyses, reverse genetics alongside with photoaffinity labeling assays, and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations identified two functional cholesterol binding motifs within the prM transmembrane domain. Loss of prM–cholesterol association has a bipartite effect reducing ZIKV entry and leading to assembly defects. We propose a model in which membrane-resident M facilitates cholesterol-supported lipid exchange during endosomal entry and, together with cholesterol, creates a platform promoting virion assembly. In summary, we identify a bifunctional role of prM in the ZIKV life cycle by mediating viral entry and virus assembly in a cholesterol-dependent manner.

TI  - Zika virus productively infects primary human placenta-specific macrophages.
JF  - JCI insight
VL  - 1 13
AB  - The strong association of Zika virus infection with congenital defects has led to questions of how a flavivirus is capable of crossing the placental barrier to reach the fetal brain. Here, we demonstrate permissive Zika virus infection of primary human placental macrophages, commonly referred to as Hofbauer cells, and placental villous fibroblasts. We also demonstrate Zika virus infection of Hofbauer cells within the context of the tissue ex vivo using term placental villous explants. In addition to amplifying infectious virus within a usually inaccessible area, the putative migratory activities of Hofbauer cells may aid in dissemination of Zika virus to the fetal brain. Understanding the susceptibility of placenta-specific cell types will aid future work around and understanding of Zika virus-associated pregnancy complications.

TI  - Zika virus propagation and release in human fetal astrocytes can be suppressed by neutral sphingomyelinase-2 inhibitor GW4869
JF  - Cell Discovery
VL  - 4
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurotrophic flavivirus that is capable of infecting humans, leading to brain abnormalities during fetal development. The ZIKV infectivity in neural target cells remains poorly understood. Here, we found that ZIKV specifically infected glial fibrillary acidic protein- and S100B-positive primary human astrocytes derived from fetal brains. In contrast, neuron-specific Class III β-tubulin (TuJ1)-positive neurons in the astrocyte cultures and SOX2-positive neural progenitor cells derived from the fetal brains were less susceptible to ZIKV infection compared with astrocytes. The infected astrocytes released competent viral particles and manifested programmed cell death with a progressive cytopathic effect. Interestingly, ZIKV infection in human fetal astrocytes induced a significant increase of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Treatment with GW4869, a specific inhibitor of neutral sphingomyelinase-2, decreased EV levels, suppressed ZIKV propagation, and reduced the release of infectious virions in astrocytes. Therefore, ZIKV infects primary human fetal astrocytes and the infection can be suppressed by neutral sphingomyelinase-2 inhibitor GW4869. Further investigation into sphingomyelin metabolism and EVs may provide insights to the therapeutic treatment of ZIKV infection.

TI  - Zika virus remodelled ER membranes contain proviral factors involved in redox and methylation pathways
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 14
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a global health issue, yet neither antiviral therapy nor a vaccine are available. ZIKV is an enveloped RNA virus, replicating in the cytoplasm in close association with ER membranes. Here, we isolate ER membranes from ZIKV-infected cells and determine their proteome. Forty-six host cell factors are enriched in ZIKV remodeled membranes, several of these having a role in redox and methylation pathways. Four proteins are characterized in detail: thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) contributing to folding of disulfide bond containing proteins and modulating ZIKV secretion; aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3), regulating capsid protein abundance and thus, ZIKV assembly; biliverdin reductase B (BLVRB) involved in ZIKV induced lipid peroxidation and increasing stability of viral transmembrane proteins; adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY) indirectly promoting m6A methylation of ZIKV RNA by decreasing the level of S- adenosyl homocysteine and thus, immune evasion. These results highlight the involvement of redox and methylation enzymes in the ZIKV life cycle and their accumulation at virally remodeled ER membranes.

TI  - Zika virus remodels and hijacks IGF2BP2 ribonucleoprotein complex to promote viral replication organelle biogenesis
JF  - eLife
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causes significant human disease that, with no approved treatment or vaccine, constitutes a major public health concern. Its life cycle entirely relies on the cytoplasmic fate of the viral RNA genome (vRNA) through a fine-tuned equilibrium between vRNA translation, replication and packaging into new virions, all within virus-induced replication organelles (vRO). In this study, with an RNAi mini-screening and subsequent functional characterization, we have identified insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) as a new host dependency factor that regulates vRNA synthesis. In infected cells, IGF2BP2 associates with viral NS5 polymerase and redistributes to the perinuclear viral replication compartment. Combined fluorescence in situ hybridization-based confocal imaging, in vitro binding assays, and immunoprecipitation coupled to RT-qPCR, showed that IGF2BP2 directly interacts with ZIKV vRNA 3’-nontranslated region. Using ZIKV sub-genomic replicons and a replication-independent vRO induction system, we demonstrated that IGF2BP2 knockdown impairs de novo viral organelle biogenesis and, consistently, vRNA synthesis. Finally, the analysis of immunopurified IGF2BP2 complex using quantitative mass spectrometry and RT-qPCR, revealed that ZIKV infection alters the protein and RNA interactomes of IGF2BP2. Altogether, our data support that ZIKV hijacks and remodels the IGF2BP2 ribonucleoprotein complex to regulate vRO biogenesis and vRNA neosynthesis.

TI  - ZIKA virus reveals broad tissue and cell tropism during the first trimester of pregnancy
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 6
AB  - The outbreak of the Zika Virus (ZIKV) and its association with fetal abnormalities have raised worldwide concern. However, the cellular tropism and the mechanisms of ZIKV transmission to the fetus during early pregnancy are still largely unknown. Therefore, we ex vivo modeled the ZIKV transmission at the maternal-fetal interface using organ culture from first trimester pregnancy samples. Here, we provide evidence that ZIKV strain circulating in Brazil infects and damages tissue architecture of the maternal decidua basalis, the fetal placenta and umbilical cord. We also show that ZIKV replicates differentially in a wide range of maternal and fetal cells, including decidual fibroblasts and macrophages, trophoblasts, Hofbauer cells as well as umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. The striking cellular tropism of ZIKV and its cytopathic-induced tissue injury during the first trimester of pregnancy could provide an explanation for the irreversible congenital damages.

TI  - Zika Virus Subgenomic Flavivirus RNA Generation Requires Cooperativity between Duplicated RNA Structures That Are Essential for Productive Infection in Human Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - Flaviviruses are important emerging and reemerging human pathogens. Understanding the molecular mechanisms for viral replication and evasion of host antiviral responses is relevant to development of control strategies. Flavivirus infections produce viral noncoding RNAs, known as sfRNAs, involved in viral replication and pathogenesis. In this study, we dissected molecular determinants for Zika virus sfRNA generation in the two natural hosts, human cells and mosquitoes. We found that two RNA structures of the viral 3′ UTR operate in a cooperative manner to produce two species of sfRNAs and that the deletion of these elements has a profoundly different impact on viral replication in the two hosts. Generation of at least one sfRNA was necessary for efficient Zika virus infection of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Moreover, recombinant viruses with different 3′ UTR arrangements revealed an essential role of sfRNAs for productive infection in human cells. In summary, we define molecular requirements for Zika virus sfRNA accumulation and provide new ideas of how flavivirus RNA structures have evolved to succeed in different hosts. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus, mainly transmitted by mosquitoes, which represents a global health threat. A common feature of flavivirus-infected cells is the accumulation of viral noncoding subgenomic RNAs by partial degradation of the viral genome, known as sfRNAs, involved in immune evasion and pathogenesis. Although great effort is being made to understand the mechanism by which these sfRNAs function during infection, the picture of how they work is still incomplete. In this study, we developed new genetic tools to dissect the functions of ZIKV RNA structures for viral replication and sfRNA production in mosquito and human hosts. ZIKV infections mostly accumulate two kinds of sfRNAs, sfRNA1 and sfRNA2, by stalling genome degradation upstream of duplicated stem loops (SLI and SLII) of the viral 3′ untranslated region (UTR). Although the two SLs share conserved sequences and structures, different functions have been found for ZIKV replication in human and mosquito cells. While both SLs are enhancers for viral infection in human cells, they play opposite roles in the mosquito host. The dissection of determinants for sfRNA formation indicated a strong cooperativity between SLI and SLII, supporting a high-order organization of this region of the 3′ UTR. Using recombinant ZIKV with different SLI and SLII arrangements, which produce different types of sfRNAs or lack the ability to generate these molecules, revealed that at least one sfRNA was necessary for efficient infection and transmission in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Importantly, we demonstrate an absolute requirement of sfRNAs for ZIKV propagation in human cells. In this regard, viruses lacking sfRNAs, constructed by deletion of the region containing SLI and SLII, were able to infect human cells but the infection was rapidly cleared by antiviral responses. Our findings are unique for ZIKV, since in previous studies, other flaviviruses with deletions of analogous regions of the genome, including dengue and West Nile viruses, accumulated distinct species of sfRNAs and were infectious in human cells. We conclude that flaviviruses share common strategies for sfRNA generation, but they have evolved mechanisms to produce different kinds of these RNAs to accomplish virus-specific functions. IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses are important emerging and reemerging human pathogens. Understanding the molecular mechanisms for viral replication and evasion of host antiviral responses is relevant to development of control strategies. Flavivirus infections produce viral noncoding RNAs, known as sfRNAs, involved in viral replication and pathogenesis.

TI  - Zika Virus Subverts Stress Granules To Promote and Restrict Viral Gene Expression
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - Many viruses inhibit SGs. In this study, we observed that ZIKV restricts SG assembly, likely by relocalizing and subverting specific SG proteins to modulate ZIKV replication. This ZIKV-SG protein interaction is interesting, as many SG proteins are also known to function in neuronal granules, which are critical in neural development and function. Moreover, dysregulation of different SG proteins in neurons has been shown to play a role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The likely consequences of ZIKV modulating SG assembly and subverting specific SG proteins are alterations to cellular mRNA transcription, splicing, stability, and translation. Such changes in cellular ribostasis could profoundly affect neural development and contribute to the devastating developmental and neurological anomalies observed following intrauterine ZIKV infection. Our study provides new insights into virus-host interactions and the identification of the SG proteins that may contribute to the unusual pathogenesis associated with this reemerging arbovirus. ABSTRACT Flaviviruses limit the cell stress response by preventing the formation of stress granules (SGs) and modulate viral gene expression by subverting different proteins involved in the stress granule pathway. In this study, we investigated the formation of stress granules during Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and the role stress granule proteins play during the viral life cycle. Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we determined that ZIKV disrupted the formation of arsenite-induced stress granules and changed the subcellular distribution, but not the abundance or integrity, of stress granule proteins. We also investigated the role of different stress granule proteins in ZIKV infection by using target-specific short interfering RNAs to deplete Ataxin2, G3BP1, HuR, TIA-1, TIAR, and YB1. Knockdown of TIA-1 and TIAR affected ZIKV protein and RNA levels but not viral titers. Conversely, depletion of Ataxin2 and YB1 decreased virion production despite having only a small effect on ZIKV protein expression. Notably, however, depletion of G3BP1 and HuR decreased and increased ZIKV gene expression and virion production, respectively. Using an MR766 Gaussia Luciferase reporter genome together with knockdown and overexpression assays, G3BP1 and HuR were found to modulate ZIKV replication. These data indicate that ZIKV disrupts the formation of stress granules by sequestering stress granule proteins required for replication, where G3BP1 functions to promote ZIKV infection while HuR exhibits an antiviral effect. The results of ZIKV relocalizing and subverting select stress granule proteins might have broader consequences on cellular RNA homeostasis and contribute to cellular gene dysregulation and ZIKV pathogenesis.

TI  - Zika Virus Targeting in the Developing Brain
JF  - The Journal of Neuroscience
VL  - 37
SP  - 2161
EP  - 2175
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), a positive-sense RNA flavivirus, has attracted considerable attention recently for its potential to cause serious neurological problems, including microcephaly, cortical thinning, and blindness during early development. Recent findings suggest that ZIKV infection of the brain can occur not only during very early stages of development, but also in later fetal/early neonatal stages of maturation. Surprisingly, after peripheral inoculation of immunocompetent mice on the day of birth, the first cells targeted throughout the brain were isolated astrocytes. At later stages, more neurons showed ZIKV immunoreactivity, in part potentially due to ZIKV release from infected astrocytes. In all developing mice studied, we detected infection of retinal neurons; in many mice, this was also associated with infection of the lateral geniculate, suprachiasmatic nuclei, and superior colliculus, suggesting a commonality for the virus to infect cells of the visual system. Interestingly, in mature mice lacking a Type 1 interferon response (IFNR−/−), after inoculation of the eye, the initial majority of infected cells in the visual system were glial cells along the optic tract. ZIKV microinjection into the somatosensory cortex on one side of the normal mouse brain resulted in mirror infection restricted to the contralateral somatosensory cortex without any infection of midline brain regions, indicating the virus can move by axonal transport to synaptically coupled brain loci. These data support the view that ZIKV shows considerable complexity in targeting the CNS and may target different cells at different stages of brain development. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Zika virus (ZIKV) can cause substantial damage to the developing human brain. Here we examine a developmental mouse model of ZIKV infection in the newborn mouse in which the brain is developmentally similar to a second-trimester human fetus. After peripheral inoculation, the virus entered the CNS in all mice tested and initially targeted astrocytes throughout the brain. Infections of the retina were detected in all mice, and infection of CNS visual system nuclei in the brain was common. We find that ZIKV can be transported axonally, thereby enhancing virus spread within the brain. These data suggest that ZIKV infects multiple cell types within the brain and that astrocyte infection may play a more important role in initial infection than previously appreciated.

TI  - Zika Virus Trafficking and Interactions in the Human Male Reproductive Tract
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 7
AB  - Sexual transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) is a matter of great concern. Infectious viral particles can be shed in semen for as long as six months after infection and can be transferred to male and female sexual partners during unprotected sexual intercourse. The virus can be found inside spermatozoa and could be directly transferred to the oocyte during fertilization. Sexual transmission of ZIKV can contribute to the rise in number of infected individuals in endemic areas as well as in countries where the mosquito vector does not thrive. There is also the possibility, as has been demonstrated in mouse models, that the vaginal deposition of ZIKV particles present in semen could lead to congenital syndrome. In this paper, we review the current literature to understand ZIKV trafficking from the bloodstream to the human male reproductive tract and viral interactions with host cells in interstitial spaces, tubule walls, annexed glands and semen. We hope to highlight gaps to be filled by future research and potential routes for vaccine and antiviral development.

TI  - Zika Virus Transmission Through Blood Tissue Barriers
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas and the Caribbean revealed a new deadly strain of the mosquito-borne virus, which has never been associated with previous outbreaks in Asia. For the first time, widespread ZIKV infection was shown to cause microcephaly and death of newborns, which was most likely due to the mutation acquired during the large outbreak recorded in French Polynesia in 2013–2014. Productive ZIKV replication and persistence has been demonstrated in placenta and fetal brains. Possible association between ZIKV and microcephaly and fetal death has been confirmed using immunocompetent mouse models in vitro and in vivo. Having crossed the placenta, ZIKV directly targets neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in developing human fetus and triggers apoptosis. The embryonic endothelial cells are exceptionally susceptible to ZIKV infection, which causes cell death and tissue necrosis. On the contrary, ZIKV infection does not affect the adult brain microvascular cell morphology and blood–brain barrier function. ZIKV is transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquito bite and is introduced into the placenta/blood through replication at the site of the entry. Also, virus can be transmitted through unprotected sex. Although, multiple possible routes of virus infection have been identified, the exact mechanism(s) utilized by ZIKV to cross the placenta still remain largely unknown. In this review, the current understanding of ZIKV infection and transmission through the placental and brain barriers is summarized.

TI  - Zika virus triggers autophagy to exploit host lipid metabolism and drive viral replication
JF  - Cell Communication and Signaling : CCS
VL  - 21
AB  - Background Zika virus (ZIKV), an arbovirus of global concern, has been associated with neurological complications including microcephaly in newborns and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV depends on cholesterol to facilitate its replication; thus, cholesterol has been proposed as a therapeutic target to treat the infection using FDA-approved statins. Cholesterol is stored in intracellular lipid droplets (LD) in the form of cholesterol esters and can be regulated by autophagy. We hypothesize that the virus hijacks autophagy machinery as an early step to increase the formation of LD and viral replication, and that interference with this pathway will limit reproduction of virus. Methods We pretreated MDCK cells with atorvastatin or other inhibitors of autophagy prior to infection with ZIKV. We measured viral expression by qPCR for NS1 RNA and immunofluorescence for Zika E protein. Results Autophagy increases in virus-infected cells as early as 6 h post infection (hpi). In the presence of atorvastatin, LD are decreased, and cholesterol is reduced, targeting key steps in viral replication, resulting in suppression of replication of ZIKV is suppressed. Other both early- and late-acting autophagy inhibitors decrease both the number of LD and viral replication. Bafilomycin renders cholesterol is inaccessible to ZIKV. We also confirm previous reports of a bystander effect, in which neighboring uninfected cells have higher LD counts compared to infected cells. Conclusions We conclude that atorvastatin and inhibitors of autophagy lead to lower availability of LD, decreasing viral replication. We conclude that bafilomycin A1 inhibits viral expression by blocking cholesterol esterification to form LD. Video Abstract Graphical Abstract

TI  - Zika Virus-Encoded NS2A and NS4A Strongly Downregulate NF-κB Promoter Activity
JF  - Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology
VL  - 30
SP  - 1651
EP  - 1658
AB  - Since Zika virus (ZIKV) was first detected in Uganda in 1947, serious outbreaks have occurred globally in Yap Island, French Polynesia and Brazil. Even though the number of infections and spread of ZIKV have risen sharply, the pathogenesis and replication mechanisms of ZIKV have not been well studied. ZIKV, a recently highlighted Flavivirus, is a mosquito-borne emerging virus causing microcephaly and the Guillain-Barre syndrome in fetuses and adults, respectively. ZIKV polyprotein consists of three structural proteins named C, prM and E and seven nonstructural proteins named NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 in an 11-kb single-stranded positive sense RNA genome. The function of individual ZIKV genes on the host innate immune response has barely been studied. In this study, we investigated the modulations of the NF-κB promoter activity induced by the MDA5/RIG-I signaling pathway. According to our results, two nonstructural proteins, NS2A and NS4A, dramatically suppressed the NF-κB promoter activity by inhibiting signaling factors involved in the MDA5/RIG-I signaling pathway. Interestingly, NS2A suppressed all components of MDA5/RIG-I signaling pathway, but NS4A inhibited most signaling molecules, except IKKε and IRF3-5D. In addition, both NS2A and NS4A downregulated MDA5-induced NF-κB promoter activity in a dosedependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that NS2A and NS4A signifcantly antagonize MDA5/RIG-I-mediated NF-κB production, and these proteins seem to be controlled by different mechanisms. This study could help understand the mechanisms of how ZIKV controls innate immune responses and may also assist in the development of ZIKV-specific therapeutics.

TI  - Zika Virus-Induced Neuronal Apoptosis via Increased Mitochondrial Fragmentation
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - The 2015 to 2016 outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the Americas coincided with a dramatic increase in neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including fetal microcephaly, in newborns born to infected women. In this study, we observed mitochondrial fragmentation and disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential after 24 h of ZIKV infection in human neural stem cells and the SNB-19 glioblastoma cell line. The severity of these changes correlated with the amount of ZIKV proteins expressed in infected cells. ZIKV infection also decreased the levels of mitofusin 2, which modulates mitochondria fusion. Mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1), a small molecule inhibiting mitochondria fission, ameliorated mitochondria disruptions and reduced cell death in ZIKV-infected cells. Collectively, this study suggests that abnormal mitochondrial fragmentation contributes to ZIKV-induced neuronal cell death; rebalancing mitochondrial dynamics of fission-fusion could be a therapeutic strategy for drug development to treat ZIKV-mediated neuronal apoptosis.

TI  - Zika Virus-Induction of the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1/3 Contributes to the Modulation of Viral Replication
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 9
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has emerged and caused global outbreaks since 2007. Although ZIKV proteins have been shown to suppress early anti-viral innate immune responses, little is known about the exact mechanisms. This study demonstrates that infection with either the African or Asian lineage of ZIKV leads to a modulated expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) genes encoding SOCS1 and SOCS3 in the following cell models: A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells; JAr human choriocarcinoma cells; human neural progenitor cells. Studies of viral gene expression in response to SOCS1 or SOCS3 demonstrated that the knockdown of these SOCS proteins inhibited viral NS5 or ZIKV RNA expression, whereas overexpression resulted in an increased expression. Moreover, the overexpression of SOCS1 or SOCS3 inhibited the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptor-mediated activation of both type I and III interferon pathways. These results imply that SOCS upregulation following ZIKV infection modulates viral replication, possibly via the regulation of anti-viral innate immune responses.

VL  - 11
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) that recently caused outbreaks in the Americas. Over the past 60 years, this virus has been observed circulating among African, Asian, and Pacific Island populations, but little attention has been paid by the scientific community until the discovery that large-scale urban ZIKV outbreaks were associated with neurological complications such as microcephaly and several other neurological malformations in fetuses and newborns. This paper is a systematic review intended to list all mosquito species studied for ZIKV infection or for their vector competence. We discuss whether studies on ZIKV vectors have brought enough evidence to formally exclude other mosquitoes than Aedes species (and particularly Aedes aegypti) to be ZIKV vectors. From 1952 to August 15, 2017, ZIKV has been studied in 53 mosquito species, including 6 Anopheles, 26 Aedes, 11 Culex, 2 Lutzia, 3 Coquillettidia, 2 Mansonia, 2 Eretmapodites, and 1 Uranotaenia. Among those, ZIKV was isolated from 16 different Aedes species. The only species other than Aedes genus for which ZIKV was isolated were Anopheles coustani, Anopheles gambiae, Culex perfuscus, and Mansonia uniformis. Vector competence assays were performed on 22 different mosquito species, including 13 Aedes, 7 Culex, and 2 Anopheles species with, as a result, the discovery that A. aegypti and Aedes albopictus were competent for ZIKV, as well as some other Aedes species, and that there was a controversy surrounding Culex quinquefasciatus competence. Although Culex, Anopheles, and most of Aedes species were generally observed to be refractory to ZIKV infection, other potential vectors transmitting ZIKV should be explored.

TI  - Zika virus: Critical crosstalk between pathogenesis, cytopathic effects, and macroautophagy.
JF  - Journal of cellular biochemistry
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging positive-sense RNA arbovirus. Its genome encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved by proteases into three structural proteins (Envelope, pre-Membrane, and Capsid) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). These proteins have essential functions in viral replication cycle, cytopathic effects, and host cellular response. When infected by ZIKV, host cells promote macroautophagy, which is believed to favor virus entry. Although several authors have attempted to understand this link between macroautophagy and viral infection, little is known. Herein, we performed a narrative review of the molecular connection between macroautophagy and ZIKV infection while focusing on the roles of the structural and nonstructural proteins. We concluded that ZIKV proteins are major virulence factors that modulate host-cell machinery to its advantage by disrupting and/or blocking specific cellular systems and organelles' function, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.

TI  - Zika virus: Molecular responses and tissue tropism in the mammalian host
JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology
VL  - 29
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks have raised alarm because of reports of congenital Zika virus syndrome in infants. The virus is also known to cause the debilitating Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. As a result, extensive research has been carried out on the virus over the past few years. To study the molecular responses of viral infectivity in mammals, in vitro two‐dimensional and three‐dimensional cellular models have been employed. The in vivo models of mouse, pig, chicken, and nonhuman primates are primarily used to investigate the teratogenicity of the virus, to study effects of the virus on specific tissues, and to study the systemic effects of a proposed antiviral agent. The virus exhibits wide tissue tropism in the mammalian host. The major host tissues of viral persistence and propagation are neural tissue, ocular tissue, testicular tissue and placental tissue. An understanding of the function of viral components, viral replication cycle, and the molecular responses elicited in the host tissues is imperative for designing antiviral treatment strategies and for development of vaccines. This review provides an update on ZIKV research models and mammalian host responses with respect to ZIKV tissue infection.

TI  - Zika viruses encode 5′ upstream open reading frames affecting infection of human brain cells
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 15
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, is associated with congenital neurological complications. Here, we investigate potential pathological correlates of virus gene expression in representative ZIKV strains through RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling. In addition to the single long polyprotein found in all flaviviruses, we identify the translation of unrecognised upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the genomic 5′ region. In Asian/American strains, ribosomes translate uORF1 and uORF2, whereas in African strains, the two uORFs are fused into one (African uORF). We use reverse genetics to examine the impact on ZIKV fitness of different uORFs mutant viruses. We find that expression of the African uORF and the Asian/American uORF1 modulates virus growth and tropism in human cortical neurons and cerebral organoids, suggesting a potential role in neurotropism. Although the uORFs are expressed in mosquito cells, we do not see a measurable effect on transmission by the mosquito vector in vivo. The discovery of ZIKV uORFs sheds new light on the infection of the human brain cells by this virus and raises the question of their existence in other neurotropic flaviviruses.

TI  - ZIKV infection activates the IRE1-XBP1 and ATF6 pathways of unfolded protein response in neural cells
JF  - Journal of Neuroinflammation
VL  - 15
AB  - Many viruses depend on the extensive membranous network of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for their translation, replication, and packaging. Certain membrane modifications of the ER can be a trigger for ER stress, as well as the accumulation of viral protein in the ER by viral infection. Then, unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated to alleviate the stress. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and its infection causes microcephaly in newborns and serious neurological complications in adults. Here, we investigated ER stress and the regulating model of UPR in ZIKV-infected neural cells in vitro and in vivo. Mice deficient in type I and II IFN receptors were infected with ZIKV via intraperitoneal injection and the nervous tissues of the mice were assayed at 5 days post-infection. The expression of phospho-IRE1, XBP1, and ATF6 which were the key markers of ER stress were analyzed by immunohistochemistry assay in vivo. Additionally, the nuclear localization of XBP1s and ATF6n were analyzed by immunohistofluorescence. Furthermore, two representative neural cells, neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH) and astrocytoma cell line (CCF-STTG1), were selected to verify the ER stress in vitro. The expression of BIP, phospho-elF2α, phospho-IRE1, and ATF6 were analyzed through western blot and the nuclear localization of XBP1s was performed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. RT-qPCR was also used to quantify the mRNA level of the UPR downstream genes in vitro and in vivo. ZIKV infection significantly upregulated the expression of ER stress markers in vitro and in vivo. Phospho-IRE1 and XBP1 expression significantly increased in the cerebellum and mesocephalon, while ATF6 expression significantly increased in the mesocephalon. ATF6n and XBP1s were translocated into the cell nucleus. The levels of BIP, ATF6, phospho-elf2α, and spliced xbp1 also significantly increased in vitro. Furthermore, the downstream genes of UPR were detected to investigate the regulating model of the UPR during ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo. The transcriptional levels of atf4, gadd34, chop, and edem-1 in vivo and that of gadd34 and chop in vitro significantly increased. Findings in this study demonstrated that ZIKV infection activates ER stress in neural cells. The results offer clues to further study the mechanism of neuropathogenesis caused by ZIKV infection.

TI  - ZIKV prM hijacks PIM1 kinase for phosphorylation to prevent ubiquitin−mediated degradation and facilitate viral replication
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 14
AB  - Introduction Viral infection usually stimulates a variety of host cell factors to modulate the life cycle of the virus. PIM1, a serine/threonine protein kinase widely involved in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and apoptosis, was recently reported to be upregulated by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. However, how ZIKV-PIM1 interactions affect the viral life cycle are not fully understood. Methods and results Here, we demonstrated that ZIKV replication was suppressed by the PIM1 kinase inhibitor SGI-1776 in both wt and Ifnar1-/- murine peritoneal macrophages, indicating that PIM1 functions independently of type I IFN signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays revealed that the ZIKV structural protein precursor membrane (prM) interacted with PIM1. Moreover, we found that prM protein stability was enhanced by PIM1, which was attributed to its kinase activity. Mechanistically, we revealed that prM can undergo ubiquitin‒mediated proteolysis and the E3 ubiquitin ligase AMFR can target prM for degradation. Importantly, PIM1 catalyzed phosphorylation of prM at Ser101 and Thr107, and this phosphorylation prevented the proteasome-dependent degradation of prM by impairing its association with AMFR. Therefore, the S101/T107-D phosphorylation mimic mutant of prM was more resistant to PIM1-induced increases in cellular abundance. Discussion These findings revealed PIM1 as a critical host factor that is advantageous to ZIKV and revealed that targeting the PIM1‒prM axis is a conducive strategy for controlling ZIKV infection.

AB  - The re-emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its associated neonatal microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome have led the World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency. Until today, many related studies have successively reported the role of various viral proteins of ZIKV in the process of ZIKV infection and pathogenicity. These studies have provided significant insights for the treatment and prevention of ZIKV infection. Here we review the current research advances in the functional characterization of the interactions between each ZIKV viral protein and its host factors.

TI  - β-Catenin Restricts Zika Virus Internalization by Downregulating Axl
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - ZIKV is an emerging pathogen with sporadic outbreaks throughout the world. The most recent outbreak in North America was associated with small brains (microcephaly) in newborns. ABSTRACT The latest outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas was associated with significant neurologic complications, including microcephaly of newborns. We evaluated mechanisms that regulate ZIKV entry into human fetal astrocytes (HFAs). Astrocytes are key players in maintaining brain homeostasis. We show that the central mediator of canonical Wnt signaling, β-catenin, regulates Axl, a receptor for ZIKV infection of HFAs, at the transcriptional level. In turn, ZIKV inhibited β-catenin, potentially as a mechanism to overcome its restriction of ZIKV internalization through regulation of Axl. This was evident with three ZIKV strains tested but not with a laboratory-adapted strain which has a large deletion in its envelope gene. Finally, we show that β-catenin-mediated Axl-dependent internalization of ZIKV may be of increased importance for brain cells, as it regulated ZIKV infection of astrocytes and human brain microvascular cells but not kidney epithelial (Vero) cells. Collectively, our studies reveal a role for β-catenin in ZIKV infection and highlight a dynamic interplay between ZIKV and β-catenin to modulate ZIKV entry into susceptible target cells. IMPORTANCE ZIKV is an emerging pathogen with sporadic outbreaks throughout the world. The most recent outbreak in North America was associated with small brains (microcephaly) in newborns. We studied the mechanism(s) that may regulate ZIKV entry into astrocytes. Astrocytes are a critical resident brain cell population with diverse functions that maintain brain homeostasis, including neurogenesis and neuronal survival. We show that three ZIKV strains (and not a heavily laboratory-adapted strain with a large deletion in its envelope gene) require Axl for internalization. Most importantly, we show that β-catenin, the central mediator of canonical Wnt signaling, negatively regulates Axl at the transcriptional level to prevent ZIKV internalization into human fetal astrocytes. To overcome this restriction, ZIKV downregulates β-catenin to facilitate Axl expression. This highlights a dynamic host-virus interaction whereby ZIKV inhibits β-catenin to promote its internalization into human fetal astrocytes through the induction of Axl.
