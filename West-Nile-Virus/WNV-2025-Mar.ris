TI  - 2′-O Methylation of Internal Adenosine by Flavivirus NS5 Methyltransferase
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 8
AB  - RNA modification plays an important role in modulating host-pathogen interaction. Flavivirus NS5 protein encodes N-7 and 2′-O methyltransferase activities that are required for the formation of 5′ type I cap (m7GpppAm) of viral RNA genome. Here we reported, for the first time, that flavivirus NS5 has a novel internal RNA methylation activity. Recombinant NS5 proteins of West Nile virus and Dengue virus (serotype 4; DENV-4) specifically methylates polyA, but not polyG, polyC, or polyU, indicating that the methylation occurs at adenosine residue. RNAs with internal adenosines substituted with 2′-O-methyladenosines are not active substrates for internal methylation, whereas RNAs with adenosines substituted with N6-methyladenosines can be efficiently methylated, suggesting that the internal methylation occurs at the 2′-OH position of adenosine. Mass spectroscopic analysis further demonstrated that the internal methylation product is 2′-O-methyladenosine. Importantly, genomic RNA purified from DENV virion contains 2′-O-methyladenosine. The 2′-O methylation of internal adenosine does not require specific RNA sequence since recombinant methyltransferase of DENV-4 can efficiently methylate RNAs spanning different regions of viral genome, host ribosomal RNAs, and polyA. Structure-based mutagenesis results indicate that K61-D146-K181-E217 tetrad of DENV-4 methyltransferase forms the active site of internal methylation activity; in addition, distinct residues within the methyl donor (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) pocket, GTP pocket, and RNA-binding site are critical for the internal methylation activity. Functional analysis using flavivirus replicon and genome-length RNAs showed that internal methylation attenuated viral RNA translation and replication. Polymerase assay revealed that internal 2′-O-methyladenosine reduces the efficiency of RNA elongation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that flavivirus NS5 performs 2′-O methylation of internal adenosine of viral RNA in vivo and host ribosomal RNAs in vitro.

TI  - 2′-O Methylation of the Viral mRNA Cap by West Nile Virus Evades Ifit1-Dependent and -Independent Mechanisms of Host Restriction In Vivo
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 8
AB  - Prior studies have shown that 2′-O methyltransferase activity of flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and poxviruses promotes viral evasion of Ifit1, an interferon-stimulated innate immune effector protein. Viruses lacking 2′-O methyltransferase activity exhibited attenuation in primary macrophages that was rescued in cells lacking Ifit1 gene expression. Here, we examined the role of Ifit1 in restricting pathogenesis in vivo of wild type WNV (WNV-WT) and a mutant in the NS5 gene (WNV-E218A) lacking 2′-O methylation of the 5′ viral RNA cap. While deletion of Ifit1 had marginal effects on WNV-WT pathogenesis, WNV-E218A showed increased replication in peripheral tissues of Ifit1 −/− mice after subcutaneous infection, yet this failed to correlate with enhanced infection in the brain or lethality. In comparison, WNV-E218A was virulent after intracranial infection as judged by increased infection in different regions of the central nervous system (CNS) and a greater than 16,000-fold decrease in LD50 values in Ifit1 −/− compared to wild type mice. Ex vivo infection experiments revealed cell-type specific differences in the ability of an Ifit1 deficiency to complement the replication defect of WNV-E218A. In particular, WNV-E218A infection was impaired in both wild type and Ifit1 −/− brain microvascular endothelial cells, which are believed to participate in blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulation of virus entry into the CNS. A deficiency of Ifit1 also was associated with increased neuronal death in vivo, which was both cell-intrinsic and mediated by immunopathogenic CD8+ T cells. Our results suggest that virulent strains of WNV have largely evaded the antiviral effects of Ifit1, and viral mutants lacking 2′-O methylation are controlled in vivo by Ifit1-dependent and -independent mechanisms in different cell types.

TI  - A CRISPR screen defines a signal peptide processing pathway required by flaviviruses
JF  - Nature
VL  - 535
SP  - 164
EP  - 168
AB  - Flaviviruses infect hundreds of millions of people annually, and no antiviral therapy is available. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screen to identify host genes that, when edited, resulted in reduced flavivirus infection. Here, we validated nine human genes required for flavivirus infectivity, and these were associated with endoplasmic reticulum functions including translocation, protein degradation, and N-linked glycosylation. In particular, a subset of endoplasmic reticulum-associated signal peptidase complex (SPCS) proteins was necessary for proper cleavage of the flavivirus structural proteins (prM and E) and secretion of viral particles. Loss of SPCS1 expression resulted in markedly reduced yield of all Flaviviridae family members tested (West Nile, dengue, Zika, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and hepatitis C viruses), but had little impact on alphavirus, bunyavirus, or rhabdovirus infection or the surface expression or secretion of diverse host proteins. We found that SPCS1 dependence could be bypassed by replacing the native prM protein leader sequences with a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen leader sequence. Thus, SPCS1, either directly or indirectly via its interactions with host proteins, preferentially promotes the processing of specific protein cargo, and Flaviviridae have a unique dependence on this signal peptide processing pathway. SPCS1 and other signal processing pathway members could represent pharmacological targets for inhibiting infection by the expanding number of flaviviruses of medical concern.

TI  - A CRISPR screen identifies IFI6 as an ER-resident interferon effector that blocks flavivirus replication
JF  - Nature Microbiology
VL  - 3
SP  - 1214
EP  - 1223
AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an architecturally diverse organelle that serves as a membrane source for the replication of multiple viruses. Flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus and Zika virus, induce unique single-membrane ER invaginations that house the viral replication machinery1. Whether this virus-induced ER remodelling is vulnerable to antiviral pathways is unknown. Here, we show that flavivirus replication at the ER is targeted by the interferon (IFN) response. Through genome-scale CRISPR screening, we uncovered an antiviral mechanism mediated by a functional gene pairing between IFI6 (encoding IFN-α-inducible protein 6), an IFN-stimulated gene cloned over 30 years ago2, and HSPA5, which encodes the ER-resident heat shock protein 70 chaperone BiP. We reveal that IFI6 is an ER-localized integral membrane effector that is stabilized through interactions with BiP. Mechanistically, IFI6 prophylactically protects uninfected cells by preventing the formation of virus-induced ER membrane invaginations. Notably, IFI6 has little effect on other mammalian RNA viruses, including the related Flaviviridae family member hepatitis C virus, which replicates in double-membrane vesicles that protrude outwards from the ER. These findings support a model in which the IFN response is armed with a membrane-targeted effector that discriminately blocks the establishment of virus-specific ER microenvironments that are required for replication. Flavivirus replication at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is targeted by the interferon response through blocking of the formation of virus-induced ER membrane invaginations by the interferon-stimulated gene IFI6, encoding an ER-localized integral membrane effector.

TI  - A Combination of Naturally Occurring Mutations in North American West Nile Virus Nonstructural Protein Genes and in the 3′ Untranslated Region Alters Virus Phenotype
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 6111
EP  - 6116
AB  - ABSTRACT We previously reported mutations in North American West Nile viruses (WNVs) with a small-plaque (sp), temperature-sensitive (ts), and/or mouse-attenuated (att) phenotype. Using an infectious clone, site-directed mutations and 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) exchanges were introduced into the WNV NY99 genome. Characterization of mutants demonstrated that a combination of mutations involving the NS4B protein (E249G) together with either a mutation in the NS5 protein (A804V) or three mutations in the 3′UTR (A10596G, C10774U, A10799G) produced sp, ts, and/or att variants. These results suggested that the discovery of North American WNV-phenotypic variants is rare because of the apparent requirement of concurrent polygenic mutations.

TI  - A Conserved Peptide in West Nile Virus NS4A Protein Contributes to Proteolytic Processing and Is Essential for Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 11274
EP  - 11282
AB  - ABSTRACT The West Nile virus strain Kunjin virus (WNVKUN) NS4A protein is a multifunctional protein involved in membrane proliferation, stimulation of cellular pathways, and evasion of host defense and is a major component of the WNVKUN RNA replication complex. We identified a highly conserved region (120P-E-P-E123) upstream of the viral protease dibasic cleavage site and investigated whether this motif was required for WNVKUN replication. Single point mutations to alanine and a PEPE deletion mutation were created in a full-length infectious WNVKUN molecular clone. All mutations drastically impaired viral replication and virion production, except that of the P122A mutant, which was slightly attenuated. These mutations were subsequently transferred to a WNVKUN replicon to specifically assess effects on RNA replication alone. Again, all mutants, except P122A, showed severely reduced negative-sense RNA production as well as decreased viral protein production. Correspondingly, immunofluorescence analyses showed a lack of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) labeling and a dispersed localization of the WNVKUN proteins, suggesting that replication complex formation was additionally impaired. Attempts to rescue replication via conservative mutants largely failed except for substitution of Asp at E121, suggesting that a negative charge at this residue is equally important. Analysis of viral protein processing suggested that cleavage of the 2K peptide from NS4A did not occur with the mutant constructs. These observations imply that the combined effects of proline and negatively charged residues within the PEPE peptide are essential to promote the cleavage of 2K from NS4A, which is a prerequisite for efficient WNV replication.

TI  - A Critical Role for Induced IgM in the Protection against West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - The Journal of Experimental Medicine
VL  - 198
SP  - 1853
EP  - 1862
AB  - In humans, the elderly and immunocompromised are at greatest risk for disseminated West Nile virus (WNV) infection, yet the immunologic basis for this remains unclear. We demonstrated previously that B cells and IgG contributed to the defense against disseminated WNV infection (Diamond, M.S., B. Shrestha, A. Marri, D. Mahan, and M. Engle. 2003. J. Virol. 77:2578–2586). In this paper, we addressed the function of IgM in controlling WNV infection. C57BL/6J mice (sIgM−/−) that were deficient in the production of secreted IgM but capable of expressing surface IgM and secreting other immunoglobulin isotypes were vulnerable to lethal infection, even after inoculation with low doses of WNV. Within 96 h, markedly higher levels of infectious virus were detected in the serum of sIgM−/− mice compared with wild-type mice. The enhanced viremia correlated with higher WNV burdens in the central nervous system, and was also associated with a blunted anti-WNV IgG response. Passive transfer of polyclonal anti-WNV IgM or IgG protected sIgM−/− mice against mortality, although administration of comparable amounts of a nonneutralizing monoclonal anti-WNV IgM provided no protection. In a prospective analysis, a low titer of anti-WNV IgM antibodies at day 4 uniformly predicted mortality in wild-type mice. Thus, the induction of a specific, neutralizing IgM response early in the course of WNV infection limits viremia and dissemination into the central nervous system, and protects against lethal infection.

TI  - A Head-Specific Transcriptomic Study Reveals Key Regulatory Pathways for Winter Diapause in the Mosquito Culex pipiens.
JF  - Archives of insect biochemistry and physiology
VL  - 118 2
SP  - e70032
EP  - 
AB  - The primary vector of the West Nile virus, Culex pipiens, undergoes reproductive dormancy during the adverse winter season. While our current understanding has mainly focused on cellular signals and phenotypic shifts occurring at a global scale during diapause, information on tissue-specific transcriptomic changes remains limited. This knowledge gap is a major challenge in interpreting the regulatory mechanisms at the tissue level. To address this, the present work utilized RNA-seq technology to investigate the transcriptional changes in the head that house the brain and crucial endocrinal organs such as corpora allata. We obtained RNA samples from the heads of diapausing and nondiapausing female mosquitoes at two specific time intervals, ZT0 and ZT16, and then subjected them to sequencing. Our results revealed differences in differentially expressed genes between diapause and non-diapause at ZT0 and ZT16, highlighting the phenotypic and diel variations in gene expression. We also selected twelve genes associated with the diapause phenotype and examined the transcript abundance at six different time points over 24 h. qRT-PCR analysis showed similar up- and downregulation of transcripts between the diapause and nondiapause phenotypes thus validating the results of RNA-seq. In summary, our study identified new genes with phenotypic and diel differentiation in their expression, potentially linking photoperiod to seasonal reproductive dormancy in insects. The newly presented information will significantly advance our understanding of head-specific genes crucial for insect diapause.

TI  - A Hyperactive Kunjin Virus NS3 Helicase Mutant Demonstrates Increased Dissemination and Mortality in Mosquitoes
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - Kunjin and West Nile viruses belong to the arthropod-borne flaviviruses, which can result in severe symptoms, including encephalitis, meningitis, and death. Flaviviruses have expanded into new populations and emerged as novel pathogens repeatedly in recent years, demonstrating that they remain a global threat. Currently, there are no approved antiviral therapeutics against either Kunjin or West Nile viruses. Thus, there is a pressing need for understanding the pathogenesis of these viruses in humans. In this study, we investigated the role of the Kunjin virus helicase on infection in cell culture and in vivo. This work provides new insight into how flaviviruses control pathogenesis and mosquito transmission through the nonstructural protein 3 helicase. ABSTRACT The unwinding of double-stranded RNA intermediates is critical for the replication and packaging of flavivirus RNA genomes. This unwinding activity is achieved by the ATP-dependent nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) helicase. In previous studies, we investigated the mechanism of energy transduction between the ATP and RNA binding pockets using molecular dynamics simulations and enzymatic characterization. Our data corroborated the hypothesis that motif V is a communication hub for this energy transduction. More specifically, mutations T407A and S411A in motif V exhibit a hyperactive helicase phenotype, leading to the regulation of translocation and unwinding during replication. However, the effect of these mutations on viral infection in cell culture and in vivo is not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of motif V in viral replication using West Nile virus (Kunjin subtype) T407A and S411A mutants (T407A and S411A Kunjin, respectively) in cell culture and in vivo. We were able to recover S411A Kunjin but unable to recover T407A Kunjin. Our results indicated that S411A Kunjin decreased viral infection and increased cytopathogenicity in cell culture compared to wild-type (WT) Kunjin. Similarly, decreased infection rates in surviving S411A Kunjin-infected Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were observed, but S411A Kunjin infection resulted in increased mortality compared to WT Kunjin infection. Additionally, S411A Kunjin infection increased viral dissemination and saliva positivity rates in surviving mosquitoes compared to WT Kunjin infection. These data suggest that S411A Kunjin increases viral pathogenesis in mosquitoes. Overall, these data indicate that NS3 motif V may play a role in the pathogenesis, dissemination, and transmission efficiency of Kunjin virus. IMPORTANCE Kunjin and West Nile viruses belong to the arthropod-borne flaviviruses, which can result in severe symptoms, including encephalitis, meningitis, and death.

TI  - A MicroRNA Screen Identifies the Wnt Signaling Pathway as a Regulator of the Interferon Response during Flavivirus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT The impact of mosquito-borne flavivirus infections worldwide is significant, and many critical aspects of these viruses' biology, including virus-host interactions, host cell requirements for replication, and how virus-host interactions impact pathology, remain to be fully understood. The recent reemergence and spread of flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), highlight the importance of performing basic research on this important group of pathogens. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that modulate gene expression posttranscriptionally and have been demonstrated to regulate a broad range of cellular processes. Our research is focused on identifying pro- and antiflaviviral miRNAs as a means of characterizing cellular pathways that support or limit viral replication. We have screened a library of known human miRNA mimics for their effect on the replication of three flaviviruses, DENV, WNV, and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), using a high-content immunofluorescence screen. Several families of miRNAs were identified as inhibiting multiple flaviviruses, including the miRNA miR-34, miR-15, and miR-517 families. Members of the miR-34 family, which have been extensively characterized for their ability to repress Wnt/β-catenin signaling, demonstrated strong antiflaviviral effects, and this inhibitory activity extended to other viruses, including ZIKV, alphaviruses, and herpesviruses. Previous research suggested a possible link between the Wnt and type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathways. Therefore, we investigated the role of type I IFN induction in the antiviral effects of the miR-34 family and confirmed that these miRNAs potentiate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus, the induction of IFN-responsive genes, and the release of type I IFN from transfected cells. We further demonstrate that the intersection between the Wnt and IFN signaling pathways occurs at the point of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)–TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) binding, inducing TBK1 to phosphorylate IRF3 and initiate downstream IFN signaling. In this way, we have identified a novel cellular signaling network with a critical role in regulating the replication of multiple virus families. These findings highlight the opportunities for using miRNAs as tools to discover and characterize unique cellular factors involved in supporting or limiting virus replication, opening up new avenues for antiviral research. IMPORTANCE MicroRNAs are a class of small regulatory RNAs that modulate cellular processes through the posttranscriptional repression of multiple transcripts. We hypothesized that individual miRNAs may be capable of inhibiting viral replication through their effects on host proteins or pathways. To test this, we performed a high-content screen for miRNAs that inhibit the replication of three medically relevant members of the flavivirus family: West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and dengue virus 2. The results of this screen identify multiple miRNAs that inhibit one or more of these viruses. Extensive follow-up on members of the miR-34 family of miRNAs, which are active against all three viruses as well as the closely related Zika virus, demonstrated that miR-34 functions through increasing the infected cell's ability to respond to infection through the interferon-based innate immune pathway. Our results not only add to the knowledge of how viruses interact with cellular pathways but also provide a basis for more extensive data mining by providing a comprehensive list of miRNAs capable of inhibiting flavivirus replication. Finally, the miRNAs themselves or cellular pathways identified as modulating virus infection may prove to be novel candidates for the development of therapeutic interventions.

TI  - A Molecular Determinant of West Nile Virus Secretion and Morphology as a Target for Viral Attenuation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a worldwide (re)emerging mosquito-transmitted Flavivirus causing fatal neurological diseases in humans. However, no human vaccine has been yet approved. One of the most effective live-attenuated vaccines was empirically obtained by serial passaging of wild-type yellow fever Flavivirus. However, such an approach is not acceptable nowadays, and the development of a rationally designed vaccine is necessary. Generating molecular infectious clones and mutating specific residues known to be involved in Flavivirus virulence constitute a powerful tool to promote viral attenuation. WNV membrane glycoprotein is thought to carry such essential determinants. Here, we identified two residues of this protein whose substitutions are key to the full and stable attenuation of WNV in vivo, most likely through inhibition of secretion and possible alteration of morphology. Applied to other flaviviruses, this approach should help in designing new vaccines against these viruses, which are an increasing threat to global human health. ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV), a member of the Flavivirus genus and currently one of the most common arboviruses worldwide, is associated with severe neurological disease in humans. Its high potential to reemerge and rapidly disseminate makes it a bona fide global public health problem. The surface membrane glycoprotein (M) has been associated with Flavivirus-induced pathogenesis. Here, we identified a key amino acid residue at position 36 of the M protein whose mutation impacts WNV secretion and promotes viral attenuation. We also identified a compensatory site at position M-43 whose mutation stabilizes M-36 substitution both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that introduction of the two mutations together confers a full attenuation phenotype and protection against wild-type WNV lethal challenge, eliciting potent neutralizing-antibody production in mice. Our study thus establishes the M protein as a new viral target for rational design of attenuated WNV strains.

JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - CCR5 is among the most studied chemokine receptors due to its profound significance in human health and disease. The notion that CCR5 is a functionally redundant receptor was challenged through the demonstration of its unique protective role in the context of West Nile virus in both mice and humans. In the nearly two decades since this initial discovery, numerous studies have investigated the role of CCR5 in the context of other medically important neurotropic flaviviruses, most of which appear to support a broad neuroprotective role for this receptor, although how CCR5 exerts its protective effect has been remarkably varied. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms by which CCR5 controls neurotropic flaviviruses, as well as results from human studies evaluating a genetic link to CCR5, and propose unexplored areas of research that are needed to unveil even more exciting roles for this important receptor.

TI  - A Putative Lipid-Associating Motif in the West Nile Virus NS4A Protein Is Required for Efficient Virus Replication
JF  - Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology
VL  - 9
AB  - Flavivirus replication is intimately associated with re-organized cellular membranes. These virus-induced changes in membrane architecture form three distinct membranous “organelles” that have specific functions during the flavivirus life cycle. One of these structures is the replication complex in which the flaviviral RNA is replicated to produce progeny genomes. We have previously observed that this process is strictly dependent on cellular cholesterol. In this study we have identified a putative cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) motif within the West Nile virus strain Kunjin virus (WNVKUN) NS4A protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of this motif within a WNVKUN infectious clone severely attenuated virus replication and the capacity of the mutant viruses to form the replication complex. Replication of the mutant viruses also displayed reduced co-localization with cellular markers recruited to replication sites during wild-type virus replication. In addition, we observed that the mutant viruses were significantly impaired in their ability to remodel cytoplasmic membranes. However, after extensive analysis we are unable to conclusively reveal a role for the CRAC motif in direct cholesterol binding to NS4A, suggesting additional complex lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions. We believe this study highlights the crucial role for this region within NS4A protein in recruitment of cellular and viral proteins to specialized subdomains on membrane platforms to promote efficient virus replication.

TI  - A Role for Ifit2 in Restricting West Nile Virus Infection in the Brain
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 8363
EP  - 8371
AB  - ABSTRACT Previous studies have demonstrated that type I interferon (IFN-I) restricts West Nile virus (WNV) replication and pathogenesis in peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) tissues. However, the in vivo role of specific antiviral genes that are induced by IFN-I against WNV infection remains less well characterized. Here, using Ifit2 −/− mice, we defined the antiviral function of the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) Ifit2 in limiting infection and disease in vivo by a virulent North American strain of WNV. Compared to congenic wild-type controls, Ifit2 −/− mice showed enhanced WNV infection in a tissue-restricted manner, with preferential replication in the CNS of animals lacking Ifit2. Virological analysis of cultured macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, cerebellar granule cell neurons, and cortical neurons revealed cell type-specific antiviral functions of Ifit2 against WNV. In comparison, small effects of Ifit2 were observed on the induction or magnitude of innate or adaptive immune responses. Our results suggest that Ifit2 restricts WNV infection and pathogenesis in different tissues in a cell type-specific manner.

TI  - A Role for the Chemokine RANTES in Regulating CD8 T Cell Responses during Chronic Viral Infection
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 7
AB  - RANTES (CCL5) is a chemokine expressed by many hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types that plays an important role in homing and migration of effector and memory T cells during acute infections. The RANTES receptor, CCR5, is a major target of anti-HIV drugs based on blocking viral entry. However, defects in RANTES or RANTES receptors including CCR5 can compromise immunity to acute infections in animal models and lead to more severe disease in humans infected with west Nile virus (WNV). In contrast, the role of the RANTES pathway in regulating T cell responses and immunity during chronic infection remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate a crucial role for RANTES in the control of systemic chronic LCMV infection. In RANTES−/− mice, virus-specific CD8 T cells had poor cytokine production. These RANTES−/− CD8 T cells also expressed higher amounts of inhibitory receptors consistent with more severe exhaustion. Moreover, the cytotoxic ability of CD8 T cells from RANTES−/− mice was reduced. Consequently, viral load was higher in the absence of RANTES. The dysfunction of T cells in the absence of RANTES was as severe as CD8 T cell responses generated in the absence of CD4 T cell help. Our results demonstrate an important role for RANTES in sustaining CD8 T cell responses during a systemic chronic viral infection.

TI  - A Short Hairpin RNA Screen of Interferon-Stimulated Genes Identifies a Novel Negative Regulator of the Cellular Antiviral Response
JF  - mBio
VL  - 4
AB  - ABSTRACT The type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway restricts infection of many divergent families of RNA and DNA viruses by inducing hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), some of which have direct antiviral activity. We screened 813 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs targeting 245 human ISGs using a flow cytometry approach to identify genes that modulated infection of West Nile virus (WNV) in IFN-β-treated human cells. Thirty ISGs with inhibitory effects against WNV were identified, including several novel genes that had antiviral activity against related and unrelated positive-strand RNA viruses. We also defined one ISG, activating signal cointegrator complex 3 (ASCC3), which functioned as a negative regulator of the host defense response. Silencing of ASCC3 resulted in upregulation of multiple antiviral ISGs, which correlated with inhibition of infection of several positive-strand RNA viruses. Reciprocally, ectopic expression of human ASCC3 or mouse Ascc3 resulted in downregulation of ISGs and increased viral infection. Mechanism-of-action and RNA sequencing studies revealed that ASCC3 functions to modulate ISG expression in an IRF-3- and IRF-7-dependent manner. Compared to prior ectopic ISG expression studies, our shRNA screen identified novel ISGs that restrict infection of WNV and other viruses and defined a new counterregulatory ISG, ASCC3, which tempers cell-intrinsic immunity. IMPORTANCE West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that continues to pose a threat to public health. Innate immune responses, especially those downstream of type I interferon (IFN) signaling, are critical for controlling virus infection and spread. We performed a genetic screen using a gene silencing approach and identified 30 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that contributed to the host antiviral response against WNV. As part of this screen, we also identified a novel negative regulatory protein, ASCC3, which dampens expression of ISGs, including those with antiviral or proinflammatory activity. In summary, our studies define a series of heretofore-uncharacterized ISGs with antiviral effects against multiple viruses or counterregulatory effects that temper IFN signaling and likely minimize immune-mediated pathology.

TI  - A Short N-Terminal Peptide Motif on Flavivirus Nonstructural Protein NS1 Modulates Cellular Targeting and Immune Recognition
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 9516
EP  - 9532
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus NS1 is a versatile nonstructural glycoprotein, with intracellular NS1 functioning as an essential cofactor for viral replication and cell surface and secreted NS1 antagonizing complement activation. Even though NS1 has multiple functions that contribute to virulence, the genetic determinants that regulate the spatial distribution of NS1 in cells among different flaviviruses remain uncharacterized. Here, by creating a panel of West Nile virus-dengue virus (WNV-DENV) NS1 chimeras and site-specific mutants, we identified a novel, short peptide motif immediately C-terminal to the signal sequence cleavage position that regulates its transit time through the endoplasmic reticulum and differentially directs NS1 for secretion or plasma membrane expression. Exchange of two amino acids within this motif reciprocally changed the cellular targeting pattern of DENV or WNV NS1. For WNV, this substitution also modulated infectivity and antibody-induced phagocytosis of infected cells. Analysis of a mutant lacking all three conserved N-linked glycosylation sites revealed an independent requirement of N-linked glycans for secretion but not for plasma membrane expression of WNV NS1. Collectively, our experiments define the requirements for cellular targeting of NS1, with implications for the protective host responses, immune antagonism, and association with the host cell sorting machinery. These studies also suggest a link between the effects of NS1 on viral replication and the levels of secreted or cell surface NS1.

TI  - A Single Amino Acid Substitution in the Core Protein of West Nile Virus Increases Resistance to Acidotropic Compounds
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 8
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a worldwide distributed mosquito-borne flavivirus that naturally cycles between birds and mosquitoes, although it can infect multiple vertebrate hosts including horses and humans. This virus is responsible for recurrent epidemics of febrile illness and encephalitis, and has recently become a global concern. WNV requires to transit through intracellular acidic compartments at two different steps to complete its infectious cycle. These include fusion between the viral envelope and the membrane of endosomes during viral entry, and virus maturation in the trans-Golgi network. In this study, we followed a genetic approach to study the connections between viral components and acidic pH. A WNV mutant with increased resistance to the acidotropic compound NH4Cl, which blocks organelle acidification and inhibits WNV infection, was selected. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that this mutant displayed a single amino acid substitution (Lys 3 to Glu) on the highly basic internal capsid or core (C) protein. The functional role of this replacement was confirmed by its introduction into a WNV infectious clone. This single amino acid substitution also increased resistance to other acidification inhibitor (concanamycin A) and induced a reduction of the neurovirulence in mice. Interestingly, a naturally occurring accompanying mutation found on prM protein abolished the resistant phenotype, supporting the idea of a genetic crosstalk between the internal C protein and the external glycoproteins of the virion. The findings here reported unveil a non-previously assessed connection between the C viral protein and the acidic pH necessary for entry and proper exit of flaviviruses.

TI  - A Single Amino Acid Substitution in the West Nile Virus Nonstructural Protein NS2A Disables Its Ability To Inhibit Alpha/Beta Interferon Induction and Attenuates Virus Virulence in Mice
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 2396
EP  - 2404
AB  - ABSTRACT Alpha/beta interferons (IFN-α/β) are key mediators of the innate immune response against viral infection. The ability of viruses to circumvent IFN-α/β responses plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of infection. In a previous study using subgenomic replicons of the Kunjin subtype of West Nile virus (WNVKUN), we demonstrated that the nonstructural protein NS2A is a major inhibitor of IFN-β promoter-driven transcription and that a single amino acid substitution in NS2A (Ala30 to Pro [A30P]) dramatically reduced its inhibitory effect (W. J. Liu, H. B. Chen, X. J. Wang, H. Huang, and A. A. Khromykh, J. Virol. 78:12225-12235). Here we show that incorporation of the A30P mutation into the WNVKUN genome results in a mutant virus which elicits more rapid induction and higher levels of synthesis of IFN-α/β in infected human A549 cells than that detected following wild-type WNVKUN infection. Consequently, replication of the WNVKUNNS2A/A30P mutant virus in these cells known to be high producers of IFN-α/β was abortive. In contrast, both the mutant and the wild-type WNVKUN produced similar-size plaques and replicated with similar efficiency in BHK cells which are known to be deficient in IFN-α/β production. The mutant virus was highly attenuated in neuroinvasiveness and also attenuated in neurovirulence in 3-week-old mice. Surprisingly, the mutant virus was also partially attenuated in IFN-α/βγ receptor knockout mice, suggesting that the A30P mutation may also play a role in more efficient activation of other antiviral pathways in addition to the IFN response. Immunization of wild-type mice with the mutant virus resulted in induction of an antibody response of similar magnitude to that observed in mice immunized with wild-type WNVKUN and gave complete protection against challenge with a lethal dose of the highly virulent New York 99 strain of WNV. The results confirm and extend our previous original findings on the role of the flavivirus NS2A protein in inhibition of a host antiviral response and demonstrate that the targeted disabling of a viral mechanism for evading the IFN response can be applied to the development of live attenuated flavivirus vaccine candidates.

TI  - A Systems Biology Approach Reveals that Tissue Tropism to West Nile Virus Is Regulated by Antiviral Genes and Innate Immune Cellular Processes
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 9
AB  - The actions of the RIG-I like receptor (RLR) and type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathways are essential for a protective innate immune response against the emerging flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV). In mice lacking RLR or IFN signaling pathways, WNV exhibits enhanced tissue tropism, indicating that specific host factors of innate immune defense restrict WNV infection and dissemination in peripheral tissues. However, the immune mechanisms by which the RLR and IFN pathways coordinate and function to impart restriction of WNV infection are not well defined. Using a systems biology approach, we defined the host innate immune response signature and actions that restrict WNV tissue tropism. Transcriptional profiling and pathway modeling to compare WNV-infected permissive (spleen) and nonpermissive (liver) tissues showed high enrichment for inflammatory responses, including pattern recognition receptors and IFN signaling pathways, that define restriction of WNV replication in the liver. Assessment of infected livers from Mavs−/−×Ifnar−/− mice revealed the loss of expression of several key components within the natural killer (NK) cell signaling pathway, including genes associated with NK cell activation, inflammatory cytokine production, and NK cell receptor signaling. In vivo analysis of hepatic immune cell infiltrates from WT mice demonstrated that WNV infection leads to an increase in NK cell numbers with enhanced proliferation, maturation, and effector action. In contrast, livers from Mavs−/−×Ifnar−/− infected mice displayed reduced immune cell infiltration, including a significant reduction in NK cell numbers. Analysis of cocultures of dendritic and NK cells revealed both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic roles for the RLR and IFN signaling pathways to regulate NK cell effector activity. Taken together, these observations reveal a complex innate immune signaling network, regulated by the RLR and IFN signaling pathways, that drives tissue-specific antiviral effector gene expression and innate immune cellular processes that control tissue tropism to WNV infection.

AB  - BackgroundMicroscopic imaging of viruses and their interactions with and effects on host cells are frequently held back by limitations of the microscope's resolution or the invasive nature of the sample preparation procedures. It is also difficult to have a technique that would allow simultaneous imaging of both surface and sub-surface on the same cell. This has hampered endeavours to elucidate virus-host interactions. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which is commonly used in the physical sciences, is now becoming a good correlative form of microscopy used to complement existing optical, confocal and electron microscopy for biological applicationsResultsIn this study, the West Nile (Sarafend) virus-infected Vero cell model was used. The atomic force microscope was found to be useful in producing high resolution images of virus-host events with minimal sample processing requirements. The AFM was able to image the budding of the West Nile (Sarafend) virus at the infected cell surface. Proliferation of the filopodia and thickening of clusters of actin filaments accompanied West Nile virus replication.ConclusionsThe study shows that the AFM is useful for virus-host interaction studies. The technique provides morphological information on both the virus and the host cell during the infection stages.

TI  - A naturally occurring antiviral ribonucleotide encoded by the human genome

EP  - 614
AB  - Viral infections continue to represent major challenges to public health, and an enhanced mechanistic understanding of the processes that contribute to viral life cycles is necessary for the development of new therapeutic strategies1. Viperin, a member of the radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) superfamily of enzymes, is an interferon-inducible protein implicated in the inhibition of replication of a broad range of RNA and DNA viruses, including dengue virus, West Nile virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza A virus, rabies virus2 and HIV3,4. Viperin has been suggested to elicit these broad antiviral activities through interactions with a large number of functionally unrelated host and viral proteins3,4. Here we demonstrate that viperin catalyses the conversion of cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to 3ʹ-deoxy-3′,4ʹ-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP), a previously undescribed biologically relevant molecule, via a SAM-dependent radical mechanism. We show that mammalian cells expressing viperin and macrophages stimulated with IFNα produce substantial quantities of ddhCTP. We also establish that ddhCTP acts as a chain terminator for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases from multiple members of the Flavivirus genus, and show that ddhCTP directly inhibits replication of Zika virus in vivo. These findings suggest a partially unifying mechanism for the broad antiviral effects of viperin that is based on the intrinsic enzymatic properties of the protein and involves the generation of a naturally occurring replication-chain terminator encoded by mammalian genomes. Viperin inhibits the replication of various viruses by catalysing the conversion of CTP to ddhCTP, which is a unique nucleotide that functions as replication-chain terminator of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.

JF  - RNA
VL  - 18 11
SP  - 2029
EP  - 40
AB  - All arthropod-borne flaviviruses generate a short noncoding RNA (sfRNA) from the viral 3' untranslated region during infection due to stalling of the cellular 5'-to-3' exonuclease XRN1. We show here that formation of sfRNA also inhibits XRN1 activity. Cells infected with Dengue or Kunjin viruses accumulate uncapped mRNAs, decay intermediates normally targeted by XRN1. XRN1 repression also resulted in the increased overall stability of cellular mRNAs in flavivirus-infected cells. Importantly, a mutant Kunjin virus that cannot form sfRNA but replicates to normal levels failed to affect host mRNA stability or XRN1 activity. Expression of sfRNA in the absence of viral infection demonstrated that sfRNA formation was directly responsible for the stabilization of cellular mRNAs. Finally, numerous cellular mRNAs were differentially expressed in an sfRNA-dependent fashion in a Kunjin virus infection. We conclude that flaviviruses incapacitate XRN1 during infection and dysregulate host mRNA stability as a result of sfRNA formation.

TI  - A nonsense mutation in the gene encoding 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase/L1 isoform is associated with West Nile virus susceptibility in laboratory mice

VL  - 99
SP  - 11311
EP  - 11316
AB  - A mouse model has been established to investigate the genetic determinism of host susceptibility to West Nile (WN) virus, a member of the genus flavivirus and family Flaviviridae. Whereas WN virus causes encephalitis and death in most laboratory inbred mouse strains after peripheral inoculation, most strains derived from recently trapped wild mice are completely resistant. The phenotype of resistance/susceptibility is determined by a major locus, Wnv, mapping to chromosome 5 within the 0.4-cM-wide interval defined by markers D5Mit408 and D5Mit242. We constructed a high resolution composite/consensus map of the interval by merging the data from the mouse T31 Radiation Hybrid map and those from the homologous region of human chromosome 12q, and found the cluster of genes encoding 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetases (2′-5′-OAS) to be the most prominent candidate. This cluster encodes a multimember family of IFN-inducible proteins that is known to play an important role in the established endogenous antiviral pathway. Comparing the cDNA sequences of 2′-5′-OAS L1, L2, and L3 isoforms, between susceptible and resistant strains, we identified a STOP codon in exon 4 of the gene encoding the L1 isoform in susceptible strains that can lead to a truncated form with amputation of one domain, whereas all resistant mice tested so far have a normal copy of this gene. The observation that WN virus sensitivity of susceptible mice was completely correlated with the occurrence of a point mutation in 2′-5′-OAS L1 suggests that this isoform may play a critical role in WN pathogenesis.

TI  - A novel role for Osteopontin in facilitating West Nile virus neuroinvasion
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
AB  - 
 West Nile virus (WNV) is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA flavivirus that can cause human neuroinvasive diseases, including encephalitis and meningitis. The mechanisms by which WNV enters the central nervous system (CNS) and the host-factors that are involved in WNV neuroinvasion are not completely understood. In this study, we found increased production of soluble osteopontin (OPN) in human plasma following WNV infection compared to uninfected controls, indicating a role for OPN in WNV pathogenesis. In a mouse model, after challenge with WNV (2000 plaque forming units, PFU), OPN deficient (Opn−/−) mice exhibited a higher survival percentage (80%) than wild-type (WT) mice (20%). However, both groups had comparable levels of virus in circulating blood and peripheral organs. Interestingly, viral burden in the brains of Opn−/− mice were significantly lower than WT mice, which was coupled to reduced polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration. Soluble OPN has been previously described as a chemokine for PMN recruitment, and intracerebral supplement of recombinant OPN (50 ng/mouse) followed by an intraperitoneal challenge of WNV (2000 PFU), resulted in increased PMN infiltration and WNV load within the CNS. Furthermore, we also confirmed that infected-PMNs carried WNV into the CNS. Together, these data suggest OPN plays a negative role in recruiting WNV-infected PMNs into the CNS, thus mediating WNV neuroinvasion.

TI  - A single mutation in the envelope protein modulates flavivirus antigenicity, stability, and pathogenesis
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 13
AB  - The structural flexibility or ‘breathing’ of the envelope (E) protein of flaviviruses allows virions to sample an ensemble of conformations at equilibrium. The molecular basis and functional consequences of virus conformational dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we identified a single mutation at residue 198 (T198F) of the West Nile virus (WNV) E protein domain I-II hinge that regulates virus breathing. The T198F mutation resulted in a ~70-fold increase in sensitivity to neutralization by a monoclonal antibody targeting a cryptic epitope in the fusion loop. Increased exposure of this otherwise poorly accessible fusion loop epitope was accompanied by reduced virus stability in solution at physiological temperatures. Introduction of a mutation at the analogous residue of dengue virus (DENV), but not Zika virus (ZIKV), E protein also increased accessibility of the cryptic fusion loop epitope and decreased virus stability in solution, suggesting that this residue modulates the structural ensembles sampled by distinct flaviviruses at equilibrium in a context dependent manner. Although the T198F mutation did not substantially impair WNV growth kinetics in vitro, studies in mice revealed attenuation of WNV T198F infection. Overall, our study provides insight into the molecular basis and the in vitro and in vivo consequences of flavivirus breathing.

TI  - A single-cell atlas of the Culex tarsalis midgut during West Nile virus infection
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The mosquito midgut functions as a key interface between pathogen and vector. However, studies of midgut physiology and associated virus infection dynamics are scarce, and in Culex tarsalis – an extremely efficient vector of West Nile virus (WNV) – nonexistent. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on Cx. tarsalis midguts, defined multiple cell types, and determined whether specific cell types are more permissive to WNV infection. We identified 20 cell states comprised of 8 distinct cell types, consistent with existing descriptions of Drosophila and Aedes aegypti midgut physiology. Most midgut cell populations were permissive to WNV infection. However, there were higher levels of WNV RNA (vRNA) in enteroendocrine cells and cells enriched for mitochondrial genes, suggesting enhanced replication in these populations. In contrast, proliferating intestinal stem cell (ISC) populations had the lowest levels of vRNA, a finding consistent with studies suggesting ISC proliferation in the midgut is involved in viral control. Notably, we did not detect significant WNV-infection induced upregulation of canonical mosquito antiviral immune genes (e.g., AGO2, R2D2, etc.) at the whole-midgut level. Rather, we observed a significant positive correlation between immune gene expression levels and vRNA in individual cells, suggesting that within midgut cells, high levels of vRNA may trigger antiviral responses. Our findings establish a Cx. tarsalis midgut cell atlas, and provide insight into midgut infection dynamics of WNV by characterizing cell-type specific enhancement/restriction of, and immune response to, infection at the single-cell level.

TI  - ADP binding by the Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito D7 salivary protein enhances blood feeding on mammals
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 11
AB  - During blood-feeding, mosquito saliva is injected into the skin to facilitate blood meal acquisition. D7 proteins are among the most abundant components of the mosquito saliva. Here we report the ligand binding specificity and physiological relevance of two D7 long proteins from Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito, the vector of filaria parasites or West Nile viruses. CxD7L2 binds biogenic amines and eicosanoids. CxD7L1 exhibits high affinity for ADP and ATP, a binding capacity not reported in any D7. We solve the crystal structure of CxD7L1 in complex with ADP to 1.97 Å resolution. The binding pocket lies between the two protein domains, whereas all known D7s bind ligands either within the N- or the C-terminal domains. We demonstrate that these proteins inhibit hemostasis in ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Our results suggest that the ADP-binding function acquired by CxD7L1 evolved to enhance blood-feeding in mammals, where ADP plays a key role in platelet aggregation. D7 proteins are highly abundant in the salivary glands of several blood feeding insects. Here, the authors study the ligand binding specificity and physiological roles of the mosquito D7 proteins CxD7L1 and CxD7L2, showing that CxD7L1 acquired ADP-binding properties to enhance blood feeding in mammals.

TI  - ATF6 Signaling Is Required for Efficient West Nile Virus Replication by Promoting Cell Survival and Inhibition of Innate Immune Responses
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 2206
EP  - 2214
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus strain Kunjin (WNVKUN) is an enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus within the virus family Flaviviridae. Many flaviviruses have been shown to manipulate multiple signaling pathways, including autophagic, innate immune, and stress responses, in order to benefit replication. In particular, we have demonstrated that WNVKUN regulates the unfolded protein response (UPR), skewing the downstream effectors toward chaperone expression and Xbp-1 activation while preventing PERK-mediated translation attenuation and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) upregulation. WNVKUN-regulated UPR signaling can then be hijacked in order to affect type I interferon (IFN) responses, preventing IFN-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. To extend our previous observations, we aimed to investigate the contribution of ATF6- and IRE1-mediated signaling during WNVKUN replication and how the two sensors contribute to the inhibition of IFN signaling. ATF6-deficient cells infected with WNVKUN showed decreased protein and virion production. These cells also demonstrated increased eIF2α phosphorylation and CHOP transcription, absent in infected matched control cells. Thus, we propose that in the absence of ATF6, WNVKUN is incapable of manipulating the PERK-mediated response to infection. In contrast, infection of IRE1−/− knockout cells showed no discernible differences compared to IRE1+/+ cells. However, both ATF6 and IRE1 were required for WNVKUN-induced inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation. We suggest that the combination of abhorrent UPR signaling, promotion of cell death, and increased innate immune responses contributes to the replication defects in ATF6-deficient cells, thus demonstrating the dual importance of ATF6 in maintaining cell viability and modulating immune responses during WNVKUN infection.

TI  - AUF1 p45 Promotes West Nile Virus Replication by an RNA Chaperone Activity That Supports Cyclization of the Viral Genome
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 11586
EP  - 11599
AB  - ABSTRACT A central aspect of current virology is to define the function of cellular proteins (host factors) that support the viral multiplication process. This study aimed at characterizing cellular proteins that assist the RNA replication process of the prevalent human pathogen West Nile virus (WNV). Using in vitro and cell-based approaches, we defined the p45 isoform of AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1 (AUF1) as a host factor that enables efficient WNV replication. It was demonstrated that AUF1 p45 has an RNA chaperone activity, which aids the structural rearrangement and cyclization of the WNV RNA that is required by the viral replicase to initiate RNA replication. The obtained data suggest the RNA chaperone activity of AUF1 p45 is an important determinant of the WNV life cycle. IMPORTANCE In this study, we identified a cellular protein, AUF1 (also known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein D [hnRNPD]), acting as a helper (host factor) of the multiplication process of the important human pathogen West Nile virus. Several different variants of AUF1 exist in the cell, and one variant, AUF1 p45, was shown to support viral replication most significantly. Interestingly, we obtained a set of experimental data indicating that a main function of AUF1 p45 is to modify and thus prepare the West Nile virus genome in such a way that the viral enzyme that generates progeny genomes is empowered to do this considerably more efficiently than in the absence of the host factor. The capability of AUF1 p45 to rearrange the West Nile virus genome was thus identified to be an important aspect of a West Nile virus infection.

TI  - AXL receptor tyrosine kinase is required for T cell priming and antiviral immunity
JF  - eLife
VL  - 5
AB  - The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is induced in response to type I interferons (IFNs) and limits their production through a negative feedback loop. Enhanced production of type I IFNs in Axl-/-dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro have led to speculation that inhibition of AXL would promote antiviral responses. Notwithstanding, type I IFNs also exert potent immunosuppressive functions. Here we demonstrate that ablation of AXL enhances the susceptibility to infection by influenza A virus and West Nile virus. The increased type I IFN response in Axl-/- mice was associated with diminished DC maturation, reduced production of IL-1β, and defective antiviral T cell immunity. Blockade of type I IFN receptor or administration of IL-1β to Axl-/- mice restored the antiviral adaptive response and control of infection. Our results demonstrate that AXL is essential for limiting the immunosuppressive effects of type I IFNs and enabling the induction of protective antiviral adaptive immunity.

TI  - Accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is related to West Nile virus‐induced neuronal apoptosis
JF  - Neuropathology
VL  - 32
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) belongs to the Flaviviridae family of viruses and has emerged as a significant cause of viral encephalitis in humans, animals and birds. It has been reported that WNV replication directly induces neuronal injury, followed by neuronal cell death proven as apoptosis. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanism of neuronal apoptosis caused by this virus to develop strategies to control its pathogenicity. Accumulation of ubiquitinated abnormal proteins has been reported to be associated with neuronal apoptosis in some pathological conditions. A lot of cellular stresses prevent cellular protein quality control mechanisms, resulting in the accumulation of ubiquitinated abnormal proteins. To obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms of WNV‐induced neuronal apoptosis, we evaluated the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the WNV‐infected neuronal cells. We have observed that WNV infection caused massive neuronal injury in the brains of mice. Viral antigen was detected in the neuronal cytoplasm of the cells exhibiting neuronal apoptosis. Notably, ubiquitinated proteins were detected in WNV‐infected neuronal cells. In addition, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins was markedly enhanced in mouse neuroblastoma, Neuro‐2a cells after WNV infection. Our histopathological and in vitro studies suggest that accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in neuronal cells might be associated with neuronal apoptosis caused by WNV infection.

TI  - Actin filaments participate in West Nile (Sarafend) virus maturation process
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 71
AB  - West Nile (Sarafend) virus has previously been shown to egress by budding at the plasma membrane of infected cells, but relatively little is known about the mechanism involved in this mode of release. During the course of this study, it was discovered that actin filaments take part in the virus maturation process. Using dual‐labeled immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy at late infection (10 hr p.i.), co‐localization of viral structural (envelope and capsid) proteins with actin filaments was confirmed. The virus structural proteins were also immunoprecipitated with anti‐actin antibody, further demonstrating the strong association between the two components. Perturbation of actin filaments by cytochalasin B strongly inhibited the release of West Nile virus (∼10,000‐fold inhibition) when compared with the untreated cells. Infectious virus particles were recovered after the removal of cytochalasin B. Further confirmation was obtained when nucleocapsid particles were found associated with disrupted actin filaments at the periphery of cytochalasin B‐treated cells. Together, these results showed that actin filaments do indeed have a key role in the release of West Nile (Sarafend) virions. J. Med. Virol. 71:463–472, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

TI  - Activation of 2′ 5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase by Stem Loops at the 5′-End of the West Nile Virus Genome
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) has a positive sense RNA genome with conserved structural elements in the 5′ and 3′ -untranslated regions required for polyprotein production. Antiviral immunity to WNV is partially mediated through the production of a cluster of proteins known as the interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). The 2′ 5′-oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) are key ISGs that help to amplify the innate immune response. Upon interaction with viral double stranded RNA, OAS enzymes become activated and enable the host cell to restrict viral propagation. Studies have linked mutations in the OAS1 gene to increased susceptibility to WNV infection, highlighting the importance of OAS1 enzyme. Here we report that the region at the 5′-end of the WNV genome comprising both the 5′-UTR and initial coding region is capable of OAS1 activation in vitro. This region contains three RNA stem loops (SLI, SLII, and SLIII), whose relative contribution to OAS1 binding affinity and activation were investigated using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and enzyme kinetics experiments. Stem loop I, comprising nucleotides 1-73, is dispensable for maximum OAS1 activation, as a construct containing only SLII and SLIII was capable of enzymatic activation. Mutations to the RNA binding site of OAS1 confirmed the specificity of the interaction. The purity, monodispersity and homogeneity of the 5′-end (SLI/II/III) and OAS1 were evaluated using dynamic light scattering and analytical ultra-centrifugation. Solution conformations of both the 5′-end RNA of WNV and OAS1 were then elucidated using small-angle x-ray scattering. In the context of purified components in vitro, these data demonstrate the recognition of conserved secondary structural elements of the WNV genome by a member of the interferon-mediated innate immune response.

TI  - Activation of the West Nile virus NS3 protease: Molecular dynamics evidence for a conformational selection mechanism
JF  - Protein Science
VL  - 18
AB  - The flaviviral nonstructural 3 protease (NS3pro) is essential for virus replication and is therefore a pharmaceutically relevant target to fight Dengue and West Nile virus (WNV). NS3pro is a chymotrypsin‐like serine protease which requires a polypeptide cofactor (NS2B) for activation. Recent X‐ray crystallography studies have led to the suggestion that the substrate binds to the two‐component NS2B‐NS3pro enzyme by an induced‐fit mechanism. Here, multiple explicit water molecular dynamics simulations of the WNV NS2B‐NS3pro enzyme show that the active conformation of the NS2B cofactor (in which its β‐loop is part of the substrate binding site) is stable over a 50‐ns time scale even in the absence of the inhibitor. The partial and reversible opening of the NSB2 β‐loop and its correlated motion with an adjacent NS3pro loop, both observed in the simulations started from the active conformation, are likely to facilitate substrate binding and product release. Moreover, in five of eight simulations without inhibitor (started from two X‐ray structures both with improperly formed oxyanion hole) the Thr132‐Gly133 peptide bond flips spontaneously thereby promoting the formation of the catalytically competent oxyanion hole, which then stays stable until the end of the runs. The simulation results provide evidence at atomic level of detail that the substrate binds to the NS2B‐NS3pro enzyme by conformational selection, rather than induced‐fit mechanism.

TI  - Aedes Mosquito Salivary Components and Their Effect on the Immune Response to Arboviruses
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Vector-borne diseases are responsible for over a billion infections each year and nearly one million deaths. Mosquito-borne dengue virus, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, Chikungunya, and Rift Valley Fever viruses constitute major public health problems in regions with high densities of arthropod vectors. During the initial step of the transmission cycle, vector, host, and virus converge at the bite site, where local immune cells interact with the vector's saliva. Hematophagous mosquito saliva is a mixture of bioactive components known to modulate vertebrate hemostasis, immunity, and inflammation during the insect's feeding process. The capacity of mosquito saliva to modulate the host immune response has been well-studied over the last few decades and has led to the consensus that the presence of saliva is linked to the enhancement of virus transmission, host susceptibility, disease progression, viremia levels, and mortality. We review some of the major aspects of the interactions between mosquito saliva and the host immune response that may be useful for future studies on the control of arboviruses.

TI  - Akt Kinase Intervenes in Flavivirus Replication by Interacting with Viral Protein NS5
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Arthropod-borne flaviviruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), Usutu virus (USUV), and West Nile virus (WNV), are a growing cause of human illness and death around the world. Presently, no licensed antivirals to control them are available and, therefore, search for broad-spectrum antivirals, including host-directed compounds, is essential. The PI3K/Akt pathway controls essential cellular functions involved in cell metabolism and proliferation. Moreover, Akt has been found to participate in modulating replication in different viruses including the flaviviruses. In this work we studied the interaction of flavivirus NS5 polymerases with the cellular kinase Akt. In vitro NS5 phosphorylation experiments with Akt showed that flavivirus NS5 polymerases are phosphorylated and co-immunoprecipitate by Akt. Polymerase activity assays of Ala- and Glu-generated mutants for the Akt-phosphorylated residues also indicate that Glu mutants of ZIKV and USUV NS5s present a reduced primer-extension activity that was not observed in WNV mutants. Furthermore, treatment with Akt inhibitors (MK-2206, honokiol and ipatasertib) reduced USUV and ZIKV titers in cell culture but, except for honokiol, not WNV. All these findings suggest an important role for Akt in flavivirus replication although with specific differences among viruses and encourage further investigations to examine the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway as an antiviral potential target.

TI  - Alpha-Synuclein Expression Restricts RNA Viral Infections in the Brain
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 2767
EP  - 2782
AB  - ABSTRACT We have discovered that native, neuronal expression of alpha-synuclein (Asyn) inhibits viral infection, injury, and disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Enveloped RNA viruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV), invade the CNS and cause encephalitis, yet little is known about the innate neuron-specific inhibitors of viral infections in the CNS. Following WNV infection of primary neurons, we found that Asyn protein expression is increased. The infectious titer of WNV and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) TC83 in the brains of Asyn-knockout mice exhibited a mean increase of 104.5 infectious viral particles compared to the titers in wild-type and heterozygote littermates. Asyn-knockout mice also exhibited significantly increased virus-induced mortality compared to Asyn heterozygote or homozygote control mice. Virus-induced Asyn localized to perinuclear, neuronal regions expressing viral envelope protein and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated trafficking protein Rab1. In Asyn-knockout primary neuronal cultures, the levels of expression of ER signaling pathways, known to support WNV replication, were significantly elevated before and during viral infection compared to those in Asyn-expressing primary neuronal cultures. We propose a model in which virus-induced Asyn localizes to ER-derived membranes, modulates virus-induced ER stress signaling, and inhibits viral replication, growth, and injury in the CNS. These data provide a novel and important functional role for the expression of native alpha-synuclein, a protein that is closely associated with the development of Parkinson's disease. IMPORTANCE Neuroinvasive viruses such as West Nile virus are able to infect neurons and cause severe disease, such as encephalitis, or infection of brain tissue. Following viral infection in the central nervous system, only select neurons are infected, implying that neurons exhibit innate resistance to viral infections. We discovered that native neuronal expression of alpha-synuclein inhibited viral infection in the central nervous system. When the gene for alpha-synuclein was deleted, mice exhibited significantly decreased survival, markedly increased viral growth in the brain, and evidence of increased neuron injury. Virus-induced alpha-synuclein localized to intracellular neuron membranes, and in the absence of alpha-synuclein expression, specific endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling events were significantly increased. We describe a new neuron-specific inhibitor of viral infections in the central nervous system. Given the importance of alpha-synuclein as a cause of Parkinson's disease, these data also ascribe a novel functional role for the native expression of alpha-synuclein in the CNS.

TI  - Alpha/Beta Interferon Protects against Lethal West Nile Virus Infection by Restricting Cellular Tropism and Enhancing Neuronal Survival
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 13350
EP  - 13361
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is neurotropic in humans, birds, and other animals. While adaptive immunity plays an important role in preventing WNV spread to the central nervous system (CNS), little is known about how alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) protects against peripheral and CNS infection. In this study, we examine the virulence and tropism of WNV in IFN-α/β receptor-deficient (IFN- α/βR−/−) mice and primary neuronal cultures. IFN-α/βR−/− mice were acutely susceptible to WNV infection through subcutaneous inoculation, with 100% mortality and a mean time to death (MTD) of 4.6 ± 0.7 and 3.8± 0.5 days after infection with 100 and 102 PFU, respectively. In contrast, congenic wild-type 129Sv/Ev mice infected with 102 PFU showed 62% mortality and a MTD of 11.9 ± 1.9 days. IFN-α/βR−/− mice developed high viral loads by day 3 after infection in nearly all tissues assayed, including many that were not infected in wild-type mice. IFN-α/βR−/− mice also demonstrated altered cellular tropism, with increased infection in macrophages, B cells, and T cells in the spleen. Additionally, treatment of primary wild-type neurons in vitro with IFN-β either before or after infection increased neuronal survival independent of its effect on WNV replication. Collectively, our data suggest that IFN-α/β controls WNV infection by restricting tropism and viral burden and by preventing death of infected neurons.

TI  - Alterations in the Aedes aegypti Transcriptome during Infection with West Nile, Dengue and Yellow Fever Viruses
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 7
AB  - West Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV) and yellow fever (YFV) viruses are (re)emerging, mosquito-borne flaviviruses that cause human disease and mortality worldwide. Alterations in mosquito gene expression common and unique to individual flaviviral infections are poorly understood. Here, we present a microarray analysis of the Aedes aegypti transcriptome over time during infection with DENV, WNV or YFV. We identified 203 mosquito genes that were ≥5-fold differentially up-regulated (DUR) and 202 genes that were ≥10-fold differentially down-regulated (DDR) during infection with one of the three flaviviruses. Comparative analysis revealed that the expression profile of 20 DUR genes and 15 DDR genes was quite similar between the three flaviviruses on D1 of infection, indicating a potentially conserved transcriptomic signature of flaviviral infection. Bioinformatics analysis revealed changes in expression of genes from diverse cellular processes, including ion binding, transport, metabolic processes and peptidase activity. We also demonstrate that virally-regulated gene expression is tissue-specific. The overexpression of several virally down-regulated genes decreased WNV infection in mosquito cells and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Among these, a pupal cuticle protein was shown to bind WNV envelope protein, leading to inhibition of infection in vitro and the prevention of lethal WNV encephalitis in mice. This work provides an extensive list of targets for controlling flaviviral infection in mosquitoes that may also be used to develop broad preventative and therapeutic measures for multiple flaviviruses.

TI  - Altered m6A modification of specific cellular transcripts affects Flaviviridae infection
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) can modulate mRNA fate and thus affect many biological processes. We analyzed m6A modification across the transcriptome following infection by dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). We found that infection by these viruses in the Flaviviridae family alters m6A modification of specific cellular transcripts, including RIOK3 and CIRBP. During viral infection, the addition of m6A to RIOK3 promotes its translation, while loss of m6A in CIRBP promotes alternative splicing. Importantly, we found that activation of innate immune sensing or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response by viral infection contributes to the changes in m6A modification in RIOK3 and CIRBP, respectively. Further, several transcripts with infection-altered m6A profiles, including RIOK3 and CIRBP, encode proteins that influence DENV, ZIKV, and HCV infection. Overall, this work reveals that cellular signaling pathways activated during viral infection lead to alterations in m6A modification of host mRNAs to regulate infection.

TI  - Amino Acids at Positions 156 and 332 in the E Protein of the West Nile Virus Subtype Kunjin Virus Classical Strain OR393 Are Involved in Plaque Size, Growth, and Pathogenicity in Mice
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - The West Nile virus (WNV) subtype Kunjin virus (WNVKUN) is endemic to Australia. Here, we characterized the classical WNVKUN strain, OR393. The original OR393 strain contained two types of viruses: small plaque-forming virus (SP) and large plaque-forming virus (LP). The amino acid residues at positions 156 and 332 in the E protein (E156 and E332) of SP were Ser and Lys (E156S/332K), respectively, whereas those in LP were Phe and Thr (E156F/332T). SP grew slightly faster than LP in vitro. The E protein of SP was N-glycosylated, whereas that of LP was not. Analysis using two recombinant single-mutant LP viruses, rKUNV-LP-EF156S and rKUNV-LP-ET332K, indicated that E156S enlarged plaques formed by LP, but E332K potently reduced them, regardless of the amino acid at E156. rKUNV-LP-EF156S showed significantly higher neuroinvasive ability than LP, SP, and rKUNV-LP-ET332K. Our results indicate that the low-pathogenic classical WNVKUN can easily change its pathogenicity through only a few amino acid substitutions in the E protein. It was also found that Phe at E156 of the rKUNV-LP-ET332K was easily changed to Ser during replication in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that E156S is advantageous for the propagation of WNVKUN in mammalian cells.

TI  - Amino acid signatures in the HLA class II peptide-binding region associated with protection/susceptibility to the severe West Nile Virus disease
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 13
AB  - The MHC class II region in humans is highly polymorphic. Each MHC molecule is formed by an α and a β chain, produced by different genes, creating an antigen-binding groove. In the groove there are several pockets into which antigens anchor and fit. The affinity of this fitting determines the recognition specificity of a given peptide. Here, based on our previous results about the association of MHC class II with the WNV disease, we examined the role of the binding pockets of HLA-DPA1, -DQA1 and–DRB1 in the severe form of the disease. In HLA-DQA1, variants in all pockets 1, 6 and 9 were found to be associated with either protection and/or susceptibility to neuroinvasion caused by WNV. Similarly, pockets 7, 9 and 10 in HLA-DRB1 were associated with severe disease. Protein modeling of these molecules revealed structural and functional differences among alleles with opposite roles concerning the development of the disease. Different amino acids in positions α52 and α66 (HLA-DQA1) significantly influenced the peptide binding while DYWLR/EFA combination (HLA-DRB1) was associated with neuronal damage. Further studies could help us understand the selectivity of pocket variants in order to create suitable peptides for an effective response.

TI  - Amino acid substitutions in the non-structural proteins 4A or 4B modulate the induction of autophagy in West Nile virus infected cells independently of the activation of the unfolded protein response
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 5
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for outbreaks of meningitis and encephalitis. Whereas the activation of autophagy in cells infected with other flaviviruses is well known, the interaction of WNV with the autophagic pathway still remains unclear and there are reports describing opposite findings obtained even analyzing the same viral strain. To clarify this controversy, we first analyzed the induction of autophagic features in cells infected with a panel of WNV strains. WNV was determined to induce autophagy in a strain dependent manner. We observed that all WNV strains or isolates analyzed, except for the WNV NY99 used, upregulated the autophagic pathway in infected cells. Interestingly, a variant derived from this WNV NY99 isolated from a persistently infected mouse increased LC3 modification and aggregation. Genome sequencing of this variant revealed only two non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions when compared to parental NY99 strain. These nucleotide substitutions introduced one amino acid replacement in NS4A and other in NS4B. Using genetically engineered viruses we showed that introduction of only one of these replacements was sufficient to upregulate the autophagic pathway. Thus, in this work we have shown that naturally occurring point mutations in the viral non-structural proteins NS4A and NS4B confer WNV with the ability to induce the hallmarks of autophagy such as LC3 modification and aggregation. Even more, the differences on the induction of an autophagic response observed among WNV variants in infected cells did not correlate with alterations on the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), suggesting an uncoupling of UPR and autophagy during flavivirus infection. The findings here reported could help to improve the knowledge of the cellular processes involved on flavivirus–host cell interactions and contribute to the design of effective strategies to combat these pathogens.

TI  - An RNA Thermometer Activity of the West Nile Virus Genomic 3′-Terminal Stem-Loop Element Modulates Viral Replication Efficiency during Host Switching
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - The 3′-terminal stem-loop (3′SL) of the RNA genome of the flavivirus West Nile (WNV) harbors, in its stem, one of the sequence elements that are required for genome cyclization. As cyclization is a prerequisite for the initiation of viral replication, the 3′SL was proposed to act as a replication silencer. The lower part of the 3′SL is metastable and confers a structural flexibility that may regulate the switch from the linear to the circular conformation of the viral RNA. In the human system, we previously demonstrated that a cellular RNA-binding protein, AUF1 p45, destabilizes the 3′SL, exposes the cyclization sequence, and thus promotes flaviviral genome cyclization and RNA replication. By investigating mutant RNAs with increased 3′SL stabilities, we showed the specific conformation of the metastable element to be a critical determinant of the helix-destabilizing RNA chaperone activity of AUF1 p45 and of the precision and efficiency of the AUF1 p45-supported initiation of RNA replication. Studies of stability-increasing mutant WNV replicons in human and mosquito cells revealed that the cultivation temperature considerably affected the replication efficiencies of the viral RNA variants and demonstrated the silencing effect of the 3′SL to be temperature dependent. Furthermore, we identified and characterized mosquito proteins displaying similar activities as AUF1 p45. However, as the RNA remodeling activities of the mosquito proteins were found to be considerably lower than those of the human protein, a potential cell protein-mediated destabilization of the 3′SL was suggested to be less efficient in mosquito cells. In summary, our data support a model in which the 3′SL acts as an RNA thermometer that modulates flavivirus replication during host switching.

TI  - An RNA cap (nucleoside‐2′‐O‐)‐methyltransferase in the flavivirus RNA polymerase NS5: crystal structure and functional characterization
JF  - The EMBO Journal
VL  - 21
AB  - Viruses represent an attractive system with which to study the molecular basis of mRNA capping and its relation to the RNA transcription machinery. The RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase NS5 of flaviviruses presents a characteristic motif of S‐adenosyl‐L‐methionine‐dependent methyltransferases at its N‐terminus, and polymerase motifs at its C‐terminus. The crystal structure of an N‐terminal fragment of Dengue virus type 2 NS5 is reported at 2.4 Å resolution. We show that this NS5 domain includes a typical methyltransferase core and exhibits a (nucleoside‐2′‐O‐)‐methyltransferase activity on capped RNA. The structure of a ternary complex comprising S‐adenosyl‐L‐homocysteine and a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) analogue shows that 54 amino acids N‐terminal to the core provide a novel GTP‐binding site that selects guanine using a previously unreported mechanism. Binding studies using GTP‐ and RNA cap‐analogues, as well as the spatial arrangement of the methyltransferase active site relative to the GTP‐binding site, suggest that the latter is a specific cap‐binding site. As RNA capping is an essential viral function, these results provide a structural basis for the rational design of drugs against the emerging flaviviruses.

TI  - An essential role of PI3K in the control of West Nile virus infection
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - The phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinases (PI3K) pathway regulates a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, RNA processing, protein translation, autophagy, apoptosis and antiviral immunity. Many viruses depend on PI3K signaling for replication. However, its role in flaviviral infection has not been clearly defined. Here we report that PI3K signaling is critical for the control of West Nile virus (WNV) infection by regulating type I IFN (IFN-I) response. Inhibition of PI3K activity by 3-methyl adenine (3-MA), Wortmannin (WM) and LY294002 (LY) increased viral titers by 3–16 folds in primary mouse macrophages, embryonic fibroblasts and human cell lines. Both 3-MA and LY repressed IFN-I mRNA and protein expression significantly. Surprisingly, WM enhanced the mRNA expression of IFN-I and TNF-α, and TNF-α protein production modestly, while dramatically decreased the secreted IFN-I. Further studies showed that the catalytic subunit p110δ of class I PI3K played a role in induction of antiviral immune responses. Lastly translocation of interferon regulatory factor 7(IRF7) from the cytosol to the nuclei was effectively blocked in the presence of PI3K inhibitors. Our results clearly define an antiviral role of PI3K by modulating immune responses and demonstrate differential mode of action of three PI3K inhibitors on IFN-I.

TI  - An insight into the sialotranscriptome of the West Nile mosquito vector, Culex tarsalis
JF  - BMC Genomics
VL  - 11
SP  - 51
EP  - 51
AB  - BackgroundSaliva of adult female mosquitoes help sugar and blood feeding by providing enzymes and polypeptides that help sugar digestion, control microbial growth and counteract their vertebrate host hemostasis and inflammation. Mosquito saliva also potentiates the transmission of vector borne pathogens, including arboviruses. Culex tarsalis is a bird feeding mosquito vector of West Nile Virus closely related to C. quinquefasciatus, a mosquito relatively recently adapted to feed on humans, and the only mosquito of the genus Culex to have its sialotranscriptome so far described.ResultsA total of 1,753 clones randomly selected from an adult female C. tarsalis salivary glands (SG) cDNA library were sequenced and used to assemble a database that yielded 809 clusters of related sequences, 675 of which were singletons. Primer extension experiments were performed in selected clones to further extend sequence coverage, allowing for the identification of 283 protein sequences, 80 of which code for putative secreted proteins.ConclusionComparison of the C. tarsalis sialotranscriptome with that of C. quinquefasciatus reveals accelerated evolution of salivary proteins as compared to housekeeping proteins. The average amino acid identity among salivary proteins is 70.1%, while that for housekeeping proteins is 91.2% (P < 0.05), and the codon volatility of secreted proteins is significantly higher than those of housekeeping proteins. Several protein families previously found exclusive of mosquitoes, including only in the Aedes genus have been identified in C. tarsalis. Interestingly, a protein family so far unique to C. quinquefasciatus, with 30 genes, is also found in C. tarsalis, indicating it was not a specific C. quinquefasciatus acquisition in its evolution to optimize mammal blood feeding.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 94 Pt 9
SP  - 1961
EP  - 71
AB  - The flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is a large protein that is structurally conserved among members of the genus, making it an attractive target for antiviral drug development. The protein contains a methyltransferase (MTase) domain and an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (POL) domain. Previous studies with dengue viruses have identified a genetic interaction between residues 46-49 in the αA3-motif in the MTase and residue 512 in POL. These genetic interactions are consistent with structural modelling of these domains in West Nile virus (WNV) NS5 that predict close proximity of these regions of the two domains, and potentially a functional interaction mediated via the αA3-motif. To demonstrate an interaction between the MTase and POL domains of the WNV NS5 protein, we co-expressed affinity-tagged recombinant MTase and POL proteins in human embryonic kidney cells with simian virus 40 large T antigen (HEK293T cells) and performed pulldown assays using an antibody to the flag tag on POL. Western blot analysis with an anti-MTase mAb revealed that the MTase protein was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with POL, providing the first evidence of a specific interaction between these domains. To further assess the role of the αA3 helix in this interaction, selected residues in this motif were mutated in the recombinant MTase and the effect on POL interaction determined by the pulldown assay. These mutations were also introduced into a WNV infectious clone (FLSDX) and the replication properties of these mutant viruses assessed. While none of the αA3 mutations had a significant effect on the MTase-POL association in pulldown assays, suggesting that these residues were not specific to the interaction, an E46L mutation completely abolished virus viability indicating a critical requirement of this residue in replication. Failure to generate compensatory mutations in POL to rescue replication, even after several passages of the transfection supernatant in Vero cells, precluded further conclusion of the role of this residue in the context of MTase-POL interactions.

TI  - Analysis of Adaptive Mutations in Kunjin Virus Replicon RNA Reveals a Novel Role for the Flavivirus Nonstructural Protein NS2A in Inhibition of Beta Interferon Promoter-Driven Transcription
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 12225
EP  - 12235
AB  - ABSTRACT The establishment of persistent noncytopathic replication by replicon RNAs of a number of positive-strand RNA viruses usually leads to generation of adaptive mutations in nonstructural genes. Some of these adaptive mutations (e.g., in hepatitis C virus) increase the ability of RNA replication to resist the antiviral action of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β); others (e.g., in Sindbis virus) may also lead to more efficient IFN production. Using puromycin-selectable Kunjin virus (KUN) replicon RNA, we identified two adaptive mutations in the NS2A gene (producing Ala30-to-Pro and Asn101-to-Asp mutations in the gene product; for simplicity, these will be referred to hereafter as Ala30-to-Pro and Asn101-to-Asp mutations) that, when introduced individually or together into the original wild-type (wt) replicon RNA, resulted in ∼15- to 50-fold more efficient establishment of persistent replication in hamster (BHK21) and human (HEK293 and HEp-2) cell lines. Transfection with a reporter plasmid carrying the luciferase gene under the control of the IFN-β promoter resulted in ∼6- to 7-fold-higher luciferase expression in HEp-2 cells stably expressing KUN replicon RNA with an Ala30-to-Pro mutation in the NS2A gene compared to that observed in HEp-2 cells stably expressing KUN replicon RNA with the wt NS2A gene. Moreover, cotransfection of plasmids expressing individual wt or Ala30-to-Pro-mutated NS2A genes with the IFN-β promoter reporter plasmid, followed by infection with Semliki Forest virus to activate IFN-β promoter-driven transcription, showed ∼7-fold inhibition of luciferase expression by the wt but not by the Ala30-to-Pro-mutated NS2A protein. The results show for the first time a role for the flavivirus nonstructural protein NS2A in inhibition of IFN-β promoter-driven transcription and identify a single-amino-acid mutation in NS2A that dramatically reduces this inhibitory activity. The findings determine a new function for NS2A in virus-host interactions, extend the range of KUN replicon vectors for noncytopathic gene expression, and identify NS2A as a new target for attenuation in the development of live flavivirus vaccines.

TI  - Analysis of RNA Binding by the Dengue Virus NS5 RNA Capping Enzyme
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 6
AB  - Flaviviruses are small, capped positive sense RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Dengue virus and other related flaviviruses have evolved RNA capping enzymes to form the viral RNA cap structure that protects the viral genome and directs efficient viral polyprotein translation. The N-terminal domain of NS5 possesses the methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities necessary for forming mature RNA cap structures. The mechanism for flavivirus guanylyltransferase activity is currently unknown, and how the capping enzyme binds its diphosphorylated RNA substrate is important for deciphering how the flavivirus guanylyltransferase functions. In this report we examine how flavivirus NS5 N-terminal capping enzymes bind to the 5′ end of the viral RNA using a fluorescence polarization-based RNA binding assay. We observed that the KD for RNA binding is approximately 200 nM Dengue, Yellow Fever, and West Nile virus capping enzymes. Removal of one or both of the 5′ phosphates reduces binding affinity, indicating that the terminal phosphates contribute significantly to binding. RNA binding affinity is negatively affected by the presence of GTP or ATP and positively affected by S-adensyl methoninine (SAM). Structural superpositioning of the dengue virus capping enzyme with the Vaccinia virus VP39 protein bound to RNA suggests how the flavivirus capping enzyme may bind RNA, and mutagenesis analysis of residues in the putative RNA binding site demonstrate that several basic residues are critical for RNA binding. Several mutants show differential binding to 5′ di-, mono-, and un-phosphorylated RNAs. The mode of RNA binding appears similar to that found with other methyltransferase enzymes, and a discussion of diphosphorylated RNA binding is presented.

TI  - Antagonism of the complement component C4 by flavivirus nonstructural protein NS1
JF  - The Journal of Experimental Medicine
VL  - 207
SP  - 793
EP  - 806
AB  - The complement system plays an essential protective role in the initial defense against many microorganisms. Flavivirus NS1 is a secreted nonstructural glycoprotein that accumulates in blood, is displayed on the surface of infected cells, and has been hypothesized to have immune evasion functions. Herein, we demonstrate that dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) NS1 attenuate classical and lectin pathway activation by directly interacting with C4. Binding of NS1 to C4 reduced C4b deposition and C3 convertase (C4b2a) activity. Although NS1 bound C4b, it lacked intrinsic cofactor activity to degrade C4b, and did not block C3 convertase formation or accelerate decay of the C3 and C5 convertases. Instead, NS1 enhanced C4 cleavage by recruiting and activating the complement-specific protease C1s. By binding C1s and C4 in a complex, NS1 promotes efficient degradation of C4 to C4b. Through this mechanism, NS1 protects DENV from complement-dependent neutralization in solution. These studies define a novel immune evasion mechanism for restricting complement control of microbial infection.

VL  - 96 Pt 6
SP  - 1347
EP  - 57
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV), an important global human pathogen, targets neurons to cause lethal encephalitis, primarily in elderly and immunocompromised patients. Currently, there are no approved therapeutic agents or vaccines to treat WNV encephalitis. Recent studies have suggested that inflammation is a major contributor to WNV encephalitis morbidity. In this study we evaluated the use of IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulins - a clinical product comprising pooled human IgG) as an anti-inflammatory treatment in a model of lethal WNV infection. We report here that IVIG and pooled human WNV convalescent sera (WNV-IVIG) inhibited development of lethal WNV encephalitis by suppressing central nervous system (CNS) infiltration by CD45(high) leukocytes. Pathogenic Ly6C(high) CD11b(+) monocytes were the major infiltrating subset in the CNS of infected control mice, whereas IVIG profoundly reduced infiltration of these pathogenic Ly6C(high) monocytes into the CNS of infected mice. Interestingly, WNV-IVIG was more efficacious than IVIG in controlling CNS inflammation when mice were challenged with a high-dose inoculum (10(5) versus 10(4) p.f.u.) of WNV. Importantly, adsorption of WNV E-glycoprotein neutralizing antibodies did not abrogate IVIG protection, consistent with virus neutralization not being essential for IVIG protection. These findings confirmed the potent immunomodulatory activity of generic IVIG, and emphasized its potential as an effective immunotherapeutic drug for encephalitis and other virus induced inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Antigen‐specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes protect against lethal West Nile virus encephalitis
JF  - European Journal of Immunology
VL  - 37
AB  - Infection with West Nile virus (WNV) causes fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised animals. Previous studies in mice have established that T cell protection is required for clearance of WNV infection from tissues and preventing viral persistence. The current study assessed whether specific WNV peptide epitopes could elicit a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response capable of protecting against virus infection. Hidden Markov model analysis was used to identify WNV‐encoded peptides that bound the MHC class I proteins Kb or Db. Of the 35 peptides predicted to bind MHC class I molecules, one immunodominant CTL recognition peptide was identified in each of the envelope and non‐structural protein 4B genes. Addition of these but not control peptides to CD8+ T cells from WNV‐infected mice induced IFN‐γ production. CTL clones that were generated ex vivo lysed peptide‐pulsed or WNV‐infected target cells in an antigen‐specific manner. Finally, adoptive transfer of a mixture of envelope‐ and non‐structural protein 4B‐specific CTL to recipient mice protected against lethal WNV challenge. Based on this, we conclude that CTL responses against immundominant WNV epitopes confer protective immunity and thus should be targets for inclusion in new vaccines.

TI  - Antiviral RNAi Mechanisms to Arboviruses in Mosquitoes: microRNA Profile of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus from Grenada, West Indies
JF  - Applied Microbiology
AB  - Mosquito-borne arboviruses, such as dengue virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus and yellow fever virus, impose a tremendous cost on the health of populations around the world. As a result, much effort has gone into the study of the impact of these viruses on human infections. Comparatively less effort, however, has been made to study the way these viruses interact with mosquitoes themselves. As ingested arboviruses infect their midgut and subsequently other tissue, the mosquito mounts a multifaceted innate immune response. RNA interference, the central intracellular antiviral defense mechanism in mosquitoes and other invertebrates can be induced and modulated through outside triggers (small RNAs) and treatments (transgenesis or viral-vector delivery). Accordingly, modulation of this facet of the mosquito’s immune system would thereby suggest a practical strategy for vector control. However, this requires a detailed understanding of mosquitoes’ endogenous small RNAs and their effects on the mosquito and viral proliferation. This paper provides an up-to-date overview of the mosquito’s immune system along with novel data describing miRNA profiles for Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasiatus in Grenada, West Indies.

JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Culex spp. mosquitoes are important vectors of viruses, such as West Nile virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus and Rift valley fever virus. However, their interactions with innate antiviral immunity, especially RNA interference (RNAi), are not well known. Most research on RNAi pathways in mosquitoes is focused on the tropical vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. Here, we investigated the production of arbovirus-specific small RNAs in Cx. quinquefasciatus-derived HSU cells. Furthermore, by silencing RNAi-related proteins, we investigated the antiviral role of these proteins for two different arboviruses: Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus (BUNV). Our results showed an expansion of Ago2 and Piwi6 in Cx. quinquefasciatus compared to Ae. aegypti. While silencing Ago2a and Ago2b increased BUNV replication, only Ago2b showed antiviral activity against SFV. Our results suggest differences in the function of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti RNAi proteins and highlight the virus-specific function of these proteins in Cx. quinquefasciatus.

TI  - Appraising the Roles of CBLL1 and the Ubiquitin/Proteasome System for Flavivirus Entry and Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 2980
EP  - 2989
AB  - ABSTRACT The ubiquitin ligase CBLL1 (also known as HAKAI) has been proposed to be a critical cellular factor exploited by West Nile virus (WNV) for productive infection. CBLL1 has emerged as a major hit in a recent RNA interference screen designed to identify cellular factors required for the early stages of the WNV life cycle. Follow-up experiments showed that HeLa cells knocked down for CBLL1 by a small interfering RNA (siRNA) failed to internalize WNV particles and resisted infection. Furthermore, depletion of a free-ubiquitin pool by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 abolished WNV endocytosis, suggesting that CBLL1 acts in concert with the ubiquitin proteasome system to mediate virus internalization. Here, we examined the effect of CBLL1 knockdown and proteasome inhibitors on infection by WNV and other flaviviruses. We identified new siRNAs that repress the CBLL1 protein and strongly inhibit the endocytosis of Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterial pathogen known to require CBLL1 to invade host cells. Strikingly, however, we detected efficient WNV, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus infection of human cells, despite potent downregulation of CBLL1 by RNA interference. In addition, we found that the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin did not affect WNV internalization but strongly repressed flavivirus RNA translation and replication. Together, these data do not support a requirement for CBLL1 during flavivirus entry and rather suggest an essential role of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway for flavivirus genome amplification.

AB  - A relatively small number of mosquito species transmit arboviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and West Nile viruses to hundreds of millions of people each year, yet we still lack a thorough understanding of the molecular factors that determine vector competence. Apoptosis has been shown to be an important factor in determining the outcome of virus infection for many viruses. However, until recently, it was not clear whether apoptosis plays a role in determining the outcome of arbovirus infections in mosquitoes. Recent work has begun to shed light on the roles of apoptosis in this important process.

JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 278

EP  - 24398
AB  - Flavivirus infection causes extensive proliferation and reorganization of host cell membranes to form specialized structures called convoluted membranes/paracrystalline arrays and vesicle packets (VP), the latter of which is believed to harbor flaviviral replication complexes. Using detergents and trypsin and micrococcal nuclease, we provide for the first time biochemical evidence for a double membrane compartment that encloses the replicative form (RF) RNA of the three pathogenic flaviviruses West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue viruses. The bounding membrane enclosing the VP was readily solubilized with nonionic detergents, rendering the catalytic amounts of enzymatically active protein component(s) of the replicase machinery partially sensitive to trypsin but allowing limited access for nucleases only to the vRNA and single-stranded tails of the replicative intermediate RNA. The RF co-sedimented at high speed from nonionic detergent extracts of virus-induced heavy membrane fractions along with the released individual inner membrane vesicles whose size of 75–100 nm as well as association with viral NS3 was revealed by immunoelectron microscopy. Viral RF remained nuclease-resistant even after ionic detergents solubilized the more refractory inner VP membrane. All of the viral RNA species became nuclease-sensitive following membrane disruption only upon prior trypsin treatment, suggesting that proteins coat the viral genomic RNA as well as RF within these membranous sites of flaviviral replication. These results collectively demonstrated that the newly formed viral genomic RNA associated with the VP are oriented outwards, while the RF is located inside the nonionic detergent-resistant vesicles.

TI  - Arginine methylation enhances the RNA chaperone activity of the West Nile virus host factor AUF1 p45
JF  - RNA
VL  - 22
SP  - 1574
EP  - 1591
AB  - A prerequisite for the intracellular replication process of the Flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV) is the cyclization of the viral RNA genome, which enables the viral replicase to initiate RNA synthesis. Our earlier studies indicated that the p45 isoform of the cellular AU-rich element binding protein 1 (AUF1) has an RNA chaperone activity, which supports RNA cyclization and viral RNA synthesis by destabilizing a stem structure at the WNV RNA's 3′-end. Here we show that in mammalian cells, AUF1 p45 is consistently modified by arginine methylation of its C terminus. By a combination of different experimental approaches, we can demonstrate that the methyltransferase PRMT1 is necessary and sufficient for AUF1 p45 methylation and that PRMT1 is required for efficient WNV replication. Interestingly, in comparison to the nonmethylated AUF1 p45, the methylated AUF1 p45aDMA exhibits a significantly increased affinity to the WNV RNA termini. Further data also revealed that the RNA chaperone activity of AUF1 p45aDMA is improved and the methylated protein stimulates viral RNA synthesis considerably more efficiently than the nonmethylated AUF1 p45. In addition to its destabilizing RNA chaperone activity, we identified an RNA annealing activity of AUF1 p45, which is not affected by methylation. Arginine methylation of AUF1 p45 thus represents a specific determinant of its RNA chaperone activity while functioning as a WNV host factor. Our data suggest that the methylation modifies the conformation of AUF1 p45 and in this way affects its RNA binding and restructuring activities.

TI  - Assembly and Maturation of the Flavivirus Kunjin Virus Appear To Occur in the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum and along the Secretory Pathway, Respectively
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 75
SP  - 10787
EP  - 10799
AB  - ABSTRACT The intracellular assembly site for flaviviruses in currently not known but is presumed to be located within the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Building on previous studies involving immunofluorescence (IF) and cryoimmunoelectron microscopy of Kunjin virus (KUN)-infected cells, we sought to identify the steps involved in the assembly and maturation of KUN. Thus, using antibodies directed against envelope protein E in IF analysis, we found the accumulation of E within regions coincident with the RER and endosomal compartments. Immunogold labeling of cryosections of infected cells indicated that E and minor envelope protein prM were localized to reticulum membranes continuous with KUN-induced convoluted membranes (CM) or paracrystalline arrays (PC) and that sometimes the RER contained immunogold-labeled virus particles. Both proteins were also observed to be labeled in membranes at the periphery of the induced CM or PC structures, but the latter were very seldom labeled internally. Utilizing drugs that inhibit protein and/or membrane traffic throughout the cell, we found that the secretion of KUN particles late in infection was significantly affected in the presence of brefeldin A and that the infectivity of secreted particles was severely affected in the presence of monensin and N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin. Nocodazole did not appear to affect maturation, suggesting that microtubules play no role in assembly or maturation processes. Subsequently, we showed that the exit of intact virions from the RER involves the transport of individual virions within individual vesicles en route to the Golgi apparatus. The results suggest that the assembly of virions occurs within the lumen of the RER and that subsequent maturation occurs via the secretory pathway.

TI  - Association between HLA Class I and Class II Alleles and the Outcome of West Nile Virus Infection: An Exploratory Study
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 6
AB  - Background West Nile virus (WNV) infection is asymptomatic in most individuals, with a minority developing symptoms ranging from WNV fever to serious neuroinvasive disease. This study investigated the impact of host HLA on the outcome of WNV disease. Methods A cohort of 210 non-Hispanic mostly white WNV+ subjects from Canada and the U.S. were typed for HLA-A, B, C, DP, DQ, and DR. The study subjects were divided into three WNV infection outcome groups: asymptomatic (AS), symptomatic (S), and neuroinvasive disease (ND). Allele frequency distribution was compared pair-wise between the AS, S, and ND groups using χ2 and Fisher's exact tests and P values were corrected for multiple comparisons (Pc). Allele frequencies were compared between the groups and the North American population (NA) used as a control group. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the potential synergistic effect of age and HLA allele phenotype on disease outcome. Results The alleles HLA-A*68, C*08 and DQB*05 were more frequently associated with severe outcomes (ND vs. AS, P A*68 = 0.013/Pc = 0.26, P C*08 = 0.0075/Pc = 0.064, and P DQB1*05 = 0.029/Pc = 0.68), However the apparent DQB1*05 association was driven by age. The alleles HLA-B*40 and C*03 were more frequently associated with asymptomatic outcome (AS vs. S, P B*40 = 0.021/Pc = 0.58 and AS vs. ND P C*03 = 0.039/Pc = 0.64) and their frequencies were lower within WNV+ subjects with neuroinvasive disease than within the North American population (NA vs. S, P B*40 = 0.029 and NA vs. ND, P C*03 = 0.032). Conclusions Host HLA may be associated with the outcome of WNV disease; HLA-A*68 and C*08 might function as “susceptible” alleles, whereas HLA-B*40 and C*03 might function as “protective” alleles.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 69 ( Pt 6)
SP  - 1247
EP  - 54
AB  - The major envelope protein (E) of West Nile virus mediates fusion between the membranes of the viral envelope and the target cell at optimum pH values of just below neutrality. The fusion is critical for the entry mechanism, allowing virus to escape from the acidic endosomal compartment. To define the role of the viral E protein in the fusion reaction, the conformational change in E and concomitant change of viral infectivity were studied quantitatively, using protease digestion of the E protein and assay of viral infectivity. The results showed that the conformational change occurred in a pH-dependent manner with an upper threshold of pH 7.0 and maximum conversion occurring at pH 6.4 and below. The conversion was rapid and reached a half-maximal value within 15 s after acidification. The exposure of free or cell-bound virions to acid pH resulted in the loss of infectivity in an almost identical pH-dependent manner. Based on these findings, it is suggested that there are two distinct viral modes of entry into macrophages, i.e. infectious endocytosis and non-infectious viral fusion with plasma membranes, with the pH of the extracellular medium determining which of these predominates. The implications of these observations for the role of the E protein in membrane fusion and the probable localization of fusion epitopes are discussed.

TI  - Astrocytes in Flavivirus Infections
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 20
AB  - Virus infections of the central nervous system (CNS) can manifest in various forms of inflammation, including that of the brain (encephalitis) and spinal cord (myelitis), all of which may have long-lasting deleterious consequences. Although the knowledge of how different viruses affect neural cells is increasing, understanding of the mechanisms by which cells respond to neurotropic viruses remains fragmented. Several virus types have the ability to infect neural tissue, and astrocytes, an abundant and heterogeneous neuroglial cell type and a key element providing CNS homeostasis, are one of the first CNS cell types to get infected. Astrocytes are morphologically closely aligned with neuronal synapses, blood vessels, and ventricle cavities, and thereby have the capacity to functionally interact with neurons and endothelial cells. In this review, we focus on the responses of astrocytes to infection by neurotropic flaviviruses, including tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), which have all been confirmed to infect astrocytes and cause multiple CNS defects. Understanding these mechanisms may help design new strategies to better contain and mitigate virus- and astrocyte-dependent neuroinflammation.

AB  - ABSTRACT We have previously shown that ablation of the three N-linked glycosylation sites in the West Nile virus NS1 protein completely attenuates mouse neuroinvasiveness (≥1,000,000 PFU). Here, we compared the replication of the NS1130-132QQA/175A/207A mutant to that of the parental NY99 strain in monkey kidney Vero cells. The results suggest that the mechanism of attenuation is a lack of NS1 glycosylation, which blocks efficient replication, maturation, and NS1 secretion from the endoplasmic reticulum and results in changes to the virus-induced ultrastructure.

TI  - Automated SSHHPS Analysis Predicts a Potential Host Protein Target Common to Several Neuroinvasive (+)ssRNA Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Within the viral genome, short stretches of homologous host pathogen sequences (SSHHPS) span the protease cleavage sites. To identify host proteins that may be cleaved during infection, we searched the human proteome for viral protease cleavage sites (~20 amino acids). We developed a sequence-to-symptom tool, automating the search and pairing process. We used the viral protein sequence, PHI-BLAST, and UniProt database for gene ontologies and disease relationships. We applied the tool to nine neuroinvasive viruses: Venezuelan and Eastern Equine encephalitis virus (VEEV, EEEV); severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, SARS-CoV-2); Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); EV-71; Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV); West Nile (WNV); and Zika (ZIKV). A comparison of the hits identified a protein common to all nine viruses called ADGRA2 (GPR124). ADGRA2 was a predicted hit of the 3CL main protease and papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. ADGRA2 is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor and a key endothelial regulator of brain-specific angiogenesis. It is a Wnt7A/Wnt7B specific coactivator of beta-catenin signaling and is essential for blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. We show the cleavage of the predicted sequences in MYOM1, VWF by the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro; DNAH8 (dynein) by the MERS PLpro; ADGRA2 by the alphaviral VEEV nsP2 protease; and POT1 by the SARS-CoV-2 and MERS PLpro.

JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 104
SP  - 17140
EP  - 17145
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) has emerged as a significant cause of epidemic viral encephalitis and flaccid limb paralysis, yet the mechanism by which it enters the CNS remains uncertain. We used compartmentalized neuron cultures to demonstrate that WNV spreads in both retrograde and anterograde directions via axonal transport. Transneuronal spread of WNV required axonal release of viral particles and was blocked by addition of a therapeutic neutralizing antibody. To test the physiologic significance of axonal transport in vivo, we directly inoculated the sciatic nerve of hamsters with WNV. Intrasciatic infection resulted in paralysis of the hind limb ipsilateral but not contralateral to the injection site. Limb paralysis was blocked either by surgical transection of the sciatic nerve or treatment with the therapeutic neutralizing antibody. Collectively, these studies establish that WNV undergoes bidirectional spread in neurons and that axonal transport promotes viral entry into the CNS and acute limb paralysis. Moreover, antibody therapeutics directly inhibit transneuronal spread of WNV infection and prevent the development of paralysis in vivo.

TI  - BHK cell proteins that bind to the 3' stem-loop structure of the West Nile virus genome RNA
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 69
SP  - 5650
EP  - 5658
AB  - The first 83 3' nucleotides of the genome RNA of the flavivirus West Nile encephalitis virus (WNV) form a stable stem-loop (SL) structure which is followed in the genome by a smaller SL. These 3' structures are highly conserved among divergent flaviviruses, suggesting that they may function as cis-acting signals for RNA replication and as such might specifically bind to cellular or viral proteins. Cellular proteins from uninfected and WNV-infected BHK-21 S100 cytoplasmic extracts formed three distinct complexes with the WNV plus-strand 3' SL [(+)3'SL] RNA in a gel mobility shift assay. Subsequent competitor gel shift analyses showed that two of these RNA-protein complexes, complexes 1 and 2, contained cell proteins that specifically bound to the WNV (+)3'SL RNA. UV-induced cross-linking and Northwestern blotting analyses detected WNV (+)3'SL RNA-binding proteins of 56, 84, and 105 kDa. When the S100 cytoplasmic extracts were partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography, a complex that comigrated with complex 1 was detected in fraction 19, while a complex that comigrated with complex 2 was detected in fraction 17. UV-induced cross-linking experiments indicated that an 84-kDa cell protein in fraction 17 and a 105-kDa protein in fraction 19 bound specifically to the WNV (+)3'SL RNA. In addition to binding to the (+)3'SL RNA, the 105-kDa protein bound to the SL structure located at the 3' end of the WNV minus-strand RNA. Initial mapping studies indicated that the 84- and 105-kDa proteins bind to different regions of the (+)3'SL RNA. The 3'-terminal SL RNA of another flavivirus, dengue virus type 3, specifically competed with the WNV (+)3'SL RNA in gel shift assays, suggesting that the host proteins identified in this study are flavivirus specific.

TI  - Beta Interferon Controls West Nile Virus Infection and Pathogenesis in Mice
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85

EP  - 7194
AB  - ABSTRACT Studies with mice lacking the common plasma membrane receptor for type I interferon (IFN-αβR − / −) have revealed that IFN signaling restricts tropism, dissemination, and lethality after infection with West Nile virus (WNV) or several other pathogenic viruses. However, the specific functions of individual IFN subtypes remain uncertain. Here, using IFN-β − / − mice, we defined the antiviral and immunomodulatory function of this IFN subtype in restricting viral infection. IFN-β − / − mice were more vulnerable to WNV infection than wild-type mice, succumbing more quickly and with greater overall mortality, although the phenotype was less severe than that of IFN-αβR − / − mice. The increased susceptibility of IFN-β − / − mice was accompanied by enhanced viral replication in different tissues. Consistent with a direct role for IFN-β in control of WNV replication, viral titers in ex vivo cultures of macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, and cerebellar granule cell neurons, but not cortical neurons, from IFN-β − / − mice were greater than in wild-type cells. Although detailed immunological analysis revealed no major deficits in the quality or quantity of WNV-specific antibodies or CD8+ T cells, we observed an altered CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cell response, with greater numbers after infection. Collectively, these results suggest that IFN-β controls WNV pathogenesis by restricting infection in key cell types and by modulating T cell regulatory networks.

TI  - Binding of Flavivirus Nonstructural Protein NS1 to C4b Binding Protein Modulates Complement Activation
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 187
SP  - 424
EP  - 433
AB  - The complement system plays a pivotal protective role in the innate immune response to many pathogens including flaviviruses. Flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a secreted nonstructural glycoprotein that accumulates in plasma to high levels and is displayed on the surface of infected cells but absent from viral particles. Previous work has defined an immune evasion role of flavivirus NS1 in limiting complement activation by forming a complex with C1s and C4 to promote cleavage of C4 to C4b. In this study, we demonstrate a second mechanism, also involving C4 and its active fragment C4b, by which NS1 antagonizes complement activation. Dengue, West Nile, or yellow fever virus NS1 directly associated with C4b binding protein (C4BP), a complement regulatory plasma protein that attenuates the classical and lectin pathways. Soluble NS1 recruited C4BP to inactivate C4b in solution and on the plasma membrane. Mapping studies revealed that the interaction sites of NS1 on C4BP partially overlap with the C4b binding sites. Together, these studies further define the immune evasion potential of NS1 in reducing the functional capacity of C4 in complement activation and control of flavivirus infection.

AB  - Flaviviruses, such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, are critically important human pathogens that sicken a staggeringly high number of humans every year. Most of these pathogens are transmitted by mosquitos, and not surprisingly, as the earth warms and human populations grow and move, their geographic reach is increasing. Flaviviruses are simple RNA-protein machines that carry out protein synthesis, genome replication, and virion packaging in close association with cellular lipid membranes. In this review, we examine the molecular biology of flaviviruses touching on the structure and function of viral components and how these interact with host factors. The latter are functionally divided into pro-viral and antiviral factors, both of which, not surprisingly, include many RNA binding proteins. In the interface between the virus and the hosts we highlight the role of a noncoding RNA produced by flaviviruses to impair antiviral host immune responses. Throughout the review, we highlight areas of intense investigation, or a need for it, and potential targets and tools to consider in the important battle against pathogenic flaviviruses.

AB  - Cytotoxic T (Tc) cells were generated in mice of five H-2 haplotypes against the flaviviruses Kunjin and West Nile (WNV). A panel of recombinant vaccinia viruses which between them expressed cDNA of the entire Kunjin virus genome were used to infect targets. Anti-Kunjin virus responses to determinants derived from non-structural proteins, especially NS3, NS4A and NS4B, were dominant in most mouse strains; usually only one class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction element was involved. WNV-immune Tc cells showed similar but not identical patterns of antigen recognition to Kunjin virus-immune Tc cells. The extent to which WNV-immune Tc cells recognized Kunjin virus-encoded determinants varied considerably between mice of different MHC haplotypes.

TI  - C6/36 Aedes albopictus Cells Have a Dysfunctional Antiviral RNA Interference Response
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 4
AB  - Mosquitoes rely on RNA interference (RNAi) as their primary defense against viral infections. To this end, the combination of RNAi and invertebrate cell culture systems has become an invaluable tool in studying virus-vector interactions. Nevertheless, a recent study failed to detect an active RNAi response to West Nile virus (WNV) infection in C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) cells, a mosquito cell line frequently used to study arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Therefore, we sought to determine if WNV actively evades the host's RNAi response or if C6/36 cells have a dysfunctional RNAi pathway. C6/36 and Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells were infected with WNV (Flaviviridae), Sindbis virus (SINV, Togaviridae) and La Crosse virus (LACV, Bunyaviridae) and total RNA recovered from cell lysates. Small RNA (sRNA) libraries were constructed and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. In S2 cells, virus-derived small interfering RNAs (viRNAs) from all three viruses were predominantly 21 nt in length, a hallmark of the RNAi pathway. However, in C6/36 cells, viRNAs were primarily 17 nt in length from WNV infected cells and 26–27 nt in length in SINV and LACV infected cells. Furthermore, the origin (positive or negative viral strand) and distribution (position along viral genome) of S2 cell generated viRNA populations was consistent with previously published studies, but the profile of sRNAs isolated from C6/36 cells was altered. In total, these results suggest that C6/36 cells lack a functional antiviral RNAi response. These findings are analogous to the type-I interferon deficiency described in Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells and suggest that C6/36 cells may fail to accurately model mosquito-arbovirus interactions at the molecular level.

TI  - CCR5 deficiency increases risk of symptomatic West Nile virus infection
JF  - The Journal of Experimental Medicine
VL  - 203
SP  - 35
EP  - 40
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a reemerging pathogen that causes fatal encephalitis in several species, including mouse and human. Recently, we showed that the chemokine receptor CCR5 is critical for survival of mice infected with WNV, acting at the level of leukocyte trafficking to the brain. To test whether this receptor is also protective in man, we determined the frequency of CCR5Δ32, a defective CCR5 allele found predominantly in Caucasians, in two independent cohorts of patients, one from Arizona and the other from Colorado, who had laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic WNV infection. The distribution of CCR5Δ32 in a control population of healthy United States Caucasian random blood donors was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and CCR5Δ32 homozygotes represented 1.0% of the total group (n = 1,318). In contrast, CCR5Δ32 homozygotes represented 4.2% of Caucasians in the Arizona cohort (odds ratios [OR] = 4.4 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6–11.8], P = 0.0013) and 8.3% of Caucasians in the Colorado cohort (OR = 9.1 [95% CI, 3.4–24.8], P < 0.0001). CCR5Δ32 homozygosity was significantly associated with fatal outcome in the Arizona cohort (OR = 13.2 [95% CI, 1.9–89.9], P = 0.03). We conclude that CCR5 mediates resistance to symptomatic WNV infection. Because CCR5 is also the major HIV coreceptor, these findings have important implications for the safety of CCR5-blocking agents under development for HIV/AIDS.

TI  - CCR5 deficiency is a risk factor for early clinical manifestations of West Nile virus infection but not for viral transmission.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 201 2
SP  - 178
EP  - 85
AB  - BACKGROUND
West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus transmitted to humans by mosquito vectors. Homozygosity for CCR5Delta32, a complete loss-of-function mutation in CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), has been previously associated with severe symptomatic WNV infection in patients who present with clinical disease; however, whether it acts at the level of initial infection or in promoting clinical progression is unknown.


METHODS
Here, we address this gap in knowledge by comparing CCR5Delta32 distribution among US blood donors identified through a comprehensive blood supply screening program (34,766,863 donations from 2003 through 2008) as either WNV true positive (634 WNV-positive cases) or false positive (422 WNV-negative control participants). All subjects self-reported symptoms occurring during the 2 weeks following blood donation using a standardized questionnaire.


RESULTS
No difference was observed in CCR5Delta32 homozygous frequency between the WNV-positive cases and WNV-negative control participants. However, CCR5Delta32 homozygosity was associated in cases but not controls with clinical symptoms consistent with WNV infection (P = .002).


CONCLUSIONS
CCR5 deficiency is not a risk factor for WNV infection per se, but it is a risk factor for both early and late clinical manifestations after infection. Thus, CCR5 may function normally to limit disease due to WNV infection in humans.

TI  - CCR5 limits cortical viral loads during West Nile virus infection of the central nervous system
JF  - Journal of Neuroinflammation
VL  - 12
AB  - Cell-mediated immunity is critical for clearance of central nervous system (CNS) infection with the encephalitic flavivirus, West Nile virus (WNV). Prior studies from our laboratory have shown that WNV-infected neurons express chemoattractants that mediate recruitment of antiviral leukocytes into the CNS. Although the chemokine receptor, CCR5, has been shown to play an important role in CNS host defense during WNV infection, regional effects of its activity within the infected brain have not been defined. We used CCR5-deficient mice and an established murine model of WNV encephalitis to determine whether CCR5 activity impacts on WNV levels within the CNS in a region-specific fashion. Statistical comparisons between groups were made with one- or two-way analysis of variance; Bonferroni’s post hoc test was subsequently used to compare individual means. Survival was analyzed by the log-rank test. Analyses were conducted using Prism software (GraphPad Prism). All data were expressed as means ± SEM. Differences were considered significant if P ≤ 0.05. As previously shown, lack of CCR5 activity led to increased symptomatic disease and mortality in mice after subcutaneous infection with WNV. Evaluation of viral burden in the footpad, draining lymph nodes, spleen, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum derived from WNV-infected wild-type, and CCR5−/− mice showed no differences between the genotypes. In contrast, WNV-infected, CCR5−/− mice exhibited significantly increased viral burden in cortical tissues, including the hippocampus, at day 8 post-infection. CNS regional studies of chemokine expression via luminex analysis revealed significantly increased expression of CCR5 ligands, CCL4 and CCL5, within the cortices of WNV-infected, CCR5−/− mice compared with those of similarly infected WT animals. Cortical elevations in viral loads and CCR5 ligands in WNV-infected, CCR5−/− mice, however, were associated with decreased numbers of infiltrating mononuclear cells and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier. These data indicate that regional differences in chemokine expression occur in response to WNV infection of the CNS, and that cortical neurons require CCR5 activity to limit viral burden in this brain region.

TI  - CD11b maintains West Nile virus replication through modulation of immune response in human neuroblastoma cells
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 21
AB  - Background West Nile virus (WNV) is a rapidly spreading mosquito-borne virus accounted for neuroinvasive diseases. An insight into WNV-host factors interaction is necessary for development of therapeutic approaches against WNV infection. CD11b has key biological functions and been identified as a therapeutic target for several human diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CD11b was implicated in WNV infection. Methods SH-SY5Y cells with and without MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 or AKT inhibitor MK-2206 treatment were infected with WNV. CD11b mRNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR. WNV replication and expression of stress (ATF6 and CHOP), pro-inflammatory (TNF-α), and antiviral (IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ) factors were evaluated in WNV-infected SH-SY5Y cells with CD11b siRNA transfection. Cell viability was determined by MTS assay. Results CD11b mRNA expression was remarkably up-regulated by WNV in a time-dependent manner. U0126 but not MK-2206 treatment reduced the CD11b induction by WNV. CD11b knockdown significantly decreased WNV replication and protected the infected cells. CD11b knockdown markedly increased TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ mRNA expression induced by WNV. ATF6 mRNA expression was reduced upon CD11b knockdown following WNV infection. Conclusion These results demonstrate that CD11b is involved in maintaining WNV replication and modulating inflammatory as well as antiviral immune response, highlighting the potential of CD11b as a target for therapeutics for WNV infection.

TI  - CD22 Is Required for Protection against West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 3361
EP  - 3375
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae and the leading cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis in the United States. Humoral immunity is essential for protection against WNV infection; however, the requirements for initiating effective antibody responses against WNV infection are still unclear. CD22 (Siglec-2) is expressed on B cells and regulates B cell receptor signaling, cell survival, proliferation, and antibody production. In this study, we investigated how CD22 contributes to protection against WNV infection and found that CD22 knockout (Cd22 −/−) mice were highly susceptible to WNV infection and had increased viral loads in the serum and central nervous system (CNS) compared to wild-type (WT) mice. This was not due to a defect in humoral immunity, as Cd22 −/− mice had normal WNV-specific antibody responses. However, Cd22 −/− mice had decreased WNV-specific CD8+ T cell responses compared to those of WT mice. These defects were not simply due to reduced cytotoxic activity or increased cell death but, rather, were associated with decreased lymphocyte migration into the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) of infected Cd22 −/− mice. Cd22 −/− mice had reduced production of the chemokine CCL3 in the dLNs after infection, suggesting that CD22 affects chemotaxis via controlling chemokine production. CD22 was not restricted to B cells but was also expressed on a subset of splenic DCIR2+ dendritic cells that rapidly expand early after WNV infection. Thus, CD22 plays an essential role in controlling WNV infection by governing cell migration and CD8+ T cell responses.

TI  - CD4 T Cell Determinants in West Nile Virus Disease and Asymptomatic Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 11
AB  - West Nile (WN) virus infection of humans is frequently asymptomatic, but can also lead to WN fever or neuroinvasive disease. CD4 T cells and B cells are critical in the defense against WN virus, and neutralizing antibodies, which are directed against the viral glycoprotein E, are an accepted correlate of protection. For the efficient production of these antibodies, B cells interact directly with CD4 helper T cells that recognize peptides from E or the two other structural proteins (capsid-C and membrane-prM/M) of the virus. However, the specific protein sites yielding such helper epitopes remain unknown. Here, we explored the CD4 T cell response in humans after WN virus infection using a comprehensive library of overlapping peptides covering all three structural proteins. By measuring T cell responses in 29 individuals with either WN virus disease or asymptomatic infection, we showed that CD4 T cells focus on peptides in specific structural elements of C and at the exposed surface of the pre- and postfusion forms of the E protein. Our data indicate that these immunodominant epitopes are recognized in the context of multiple different HLA molecules. Furthermore, we observed that immunodominant antigen regions are structurally conserved and similarly targeted in other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including dengue, yellow fever, and Zika viruses. Together, these findings indicate a strong impact of virion protein structure on epitope selection and antigenicity, which is an important issue to consider in future vaccine design.

TI  - CD4+ T-Cell Responses Are Required for Clearance of West Nile Virus from the Central Nervous System
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 12060
EP  - 12069
AB  - ABSTRACT Although studies have established that innate and adaptive immune responses are important in controlling West Nile virus (WNV) infection, the function of CD4+ T lymphocytes in modulating viral pathogenesis is less well characterized. Using a mouse model, we examined the role of CD4+ T cells in coordinating protection against WNV infection. A genetic or acquired deficiency of CD4+ T cells resulted in a protracted WNV infection in the central nervous system (CNS) that culminated in uniform lethality by 50 days after infection. Mice surviving past day 10 had high-level persistent WNV infection in the CNS compared to wild-type mice, even 45 days following infection. The absence of CD4+ T-cell help did not affect the kinetics of WNV infection in the spleen and serum, suggesting a role for CD4-independent clearance mechanisms in peripheral tissues. WNV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels were similar to those of wild-type mice in CD4-deficient mice early during infection but dropped ∼20-fold at day 15 postinfection, whereas IgG levels in CD4-deficient mice were ∼100- to 1,000-fold lower than in wild-type mice throughout the course of infection. WNV-specific CD8+ T-cell activation and trafficking to the CNS were unaffected by the absence of CD4+ T cells at day 9 postinfection but were markedly compromised at day 15. Our experiments suggest that the dominant protective role of CD4+ T cells during primary WNV infection is to provide help for antibody responses and sustain WNV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in the CNS that enable viral clearance.

TI  - CD40-CD40 Ligand Interactions Promote Trafficking of CD8+ T Cells into the Brain and Protection against West Nile Virus Encephalitis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 9801
EP  - 9811
AB  - ABSTRACT Recent studies have established a protective role for T cells during primary West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Binding of CD40 by CD40 ligand (CD40L) on activated CD4+ T cells provides an important costimulatory signal for immunoglobulin class switching, antibody affinity maturation, and priming of CD8+ T-cell responses. We examined here the function of CD40-dependent interactions in limiting primary WNV infection. Compared to congenic wild-type mice, CD40−/− mice uniformly succumbed to WNV infection. Although CD40−/− mice produced low levels of WNV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG, viral clearance from the spleen and serum was not altered, and CD8+ T-cell priming in peripheral lymphoid tissues was normal. Unexpectedly, CD8+ T-cell trafficking to the central nervous system (CNS) was markedly impaired in CD40−/− mice, and this correlated with elevated WNV titers in the CNS and death. In the brains of CD40−/− mice, T cells were retained in the perivascular space and did not migrate into the parenchyma, the predominant site of WNV infection. In contrast, in wild-type mice, T cells trafficked to the site of infection in neurons. Beside its role in maturation of antibody responses, our experiments suggest a novel function of CD40-CD40L interactions: to facilitate T-cell migration across the blood-brain barrier to control WNV infection.

AB  - CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes are adaptive immune cells that play a key role in the immune response to pathogens. They have been extensively studied in a variety of model systems and the mechanisms by which they function are well described. However, the responses by these cell types vary widely from pathogen to pathogen. In this review, we will discuss the role of CD8 and CD4 T cells in the immune response to West Nile virus infection.

TI  - CD8(+) T cell-mediated immune responses in West Nile virus (Sarafend strain) encephalitis are independent of gamma interferon.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 87 Pt 12
SP  - 3599
EP  - 609
AB  - The flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV) can cause fatal encephalitis in humans and mice. It has recently been demonstrated, in an experimental model using WNV strain Sarafend and C57BL/6 mice, that both virus- and immune-mediated pathology is involved in WNV encephalitis, with CD8(+) T cells being the dominant subpopulation of lymphocyte infiltrates in the brain. Here, the role of activated WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells in mouse WNV encephalitis was investigated further. Passive transfer of WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells reduced mortality significantly and prolonged survival times of mice infected with WNV. Early infiltration of WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells into infected brains is shown, suggesting a beneficial contribution of these lymphocytes to recovery from encephalitis. This antiviral function was not markedly mediated by gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), as a deficiency in IFN-gamma did not affect mortality to two strains of WNV (Sarafend and Kunjin) or brain virus titres significantly. The cytolytic potential, as well as precursor frequency, of WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells were not altered by the absence of IFN-gamma. This was reflected in transfer experiments of WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells from IFN-gamma(-/-) mice into WNV-infected wild-type mice, which showed that IFN-gamma-deficient T cells were as effective as those from WNV-immune wild-type mice in ameliorating disease outcome. It is speculated here that one of the pleiotropic functions of IFN-gamma is mimicked by WNV-Sarafend-mediated upregulation of cell-surface expression of major histocompatibility complex antigens, which may explain the lack of phenotype of IFN-gamma(-/-) mice in response to WNV.

EP  - 13334
AB  - ABSTRACT C57BL/6J mice infected intravenously with the Sarafend strain of West Nile virus (WNV) develop a characteristic central nervous system (CNS) disease, including an acute inflammatory reaction. Dose response studies indicate two distinct kinetics of mortality. At high doses of infection (108 PFU), direct infection of the brain occurred within 24 h, resulting in 100% mortality with a 6-day mean survival time (MST), and there was minimal destruction of neural tissue. A low dose (103 PFU) of infection resulted in 27% mortality (MST, 11 days), and virus could be detected in the CNS 7 days postinfection (p.i.). Virus was present in the hypogastric lymph nodes and spleens at days 4 to 7 p.i. Histology of the brains revealed neuronal degeneration and inflammation within leptomeninges and brain parenchyma. Inflammatory cell infiltration was detectable in brains from day 4 p.i. onward in the high-dose group and from day 7 p.i. in the low-dose group, with the severity of infiltration increasing over time. The cellular infiltrates in brain consisted predominantly of CD8+, but not CD4+, T cells. CD8+ T cells in the brain and the spleen expressed the activation markers CD69 early and expressed CD25 at later time points. CD8+ T-cell-deficient mice infected with 103 PFU of WNV showed increased mortalities but prolonged MST and early infection of the CNS compared to wild-type mice. Using high doses of virus in CD8-deficient mice leads to increased survival. These results provide evidence that CD8+ T cells are involved in both recovery and immunopathology in WNV infection.

TI  - CD8+ T Cells Require Perforin To Clear West Nile Virus from Infected Neurons
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 119
EP  - 129
AB  - ABSTRACT Injury to neurons after West Nile virus (WNV) infection is believed to occur because of viral and host immune-mediated effects. Previously, we demonstrated that CD8+ T cells are required for the resolution of WNV infection in the central nervous system (CNS). CD8+ T cells can control infection by producing antiviral cytokines (e.g., gamma interferon or tumor necrosis factor alpha) or by triggering death of infected cells through perforin- or Fas ligand-dependent pathways. Here, we directly evaluated the role of perforin in controlling infection of a lineage I New York isolate of WNV in mice. A genetic deficiency of perforin molecules resulted in higher viral burden in the CNS and increased mortality after WNV infection. In the few perforin-deficient mice that survived initial challenge, viral persistence was observed in the CNS for several weeks. CD8+ T cells required perforin to control WNV infection as adoptive transfer of WNV-primed wild-type but not perforin-deficient CD8+ T cells greatly reduced infection in the brain and spinal cord and enhanced survival of CD8-deficient mice. Analogous results were obtained when wild-type or perforin-deficient CD8+ T cells were added to congenic primary cortical neuron cultures. Taken together, our data suggest that despite the risk of immunopathogenesis, CD8+ T cells use a perforin-dependent mechanism to clear WNV from infected neurons.

TI  - CD8+ T Cells Use TRAIL To Restrict West Nile Virus Pathogenesis by Controlling Infection in Neurons
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 8937
EP  - 8948
AB  - ABSTRACT Previous studies of mice have demonstrated that an orchestrated sequence of innate and adaptive immune responses is required to control West Nile virus (WNV) infection in peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) tissues. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; also known as CD253) has been reported to inhibit infection with dengue virus, a closely related flavivirus, in cell culture. To determine the physiological function of TRAIL in the context of flavivirus infection, we compared the pathogenesis of WNV in wild-type and TRAIL −/− mice. Mice lacking TRAIL showed increased vulnerability and death after subcutaneous WNV infection. Although no difference in viral burden was detected in peripheral tissues, greater viral infection was detected in the brain and spinal cord at late times after infection, and this was associated with delayed viral clearance in the few surviving TRAIL −/− mice. While priming of adaptive B and T cell responses and trafficking of immune and antigen-specific cells to the brain were undistinguishable from those in normal mice, in TRAIL −/− mice, CD8+ T cells showed qualitative defects in the ability to clear WNV infection. Adoptive transfer of WNV-primed wild-type but not TRAIL −/− CD8+ T cells to recipient CD8−/− mice efficiently limited infection in the brain and spinal cord, and analogous results were obtained when wild-type or TRAIL −/− CD8+ T cells were added to WNV-infected primary cortical neuron cultures ex vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that TRAIL produced by CD8+ T cells contributes to disease resolution by helping to clear WNV infection from neurons in the central nervous system.

TI  - CMPK2 restricts Zika virus replication by inhibiting viral translation
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 19
AB  - Flaviviruses continue to emerge as global health threats. There are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antiviral treatments for flaviviral infections. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify host and viral factors that can be targeted for effective therapeutic intervention. Type I interferon (IFN-I) production in response to microbial products is one of the host’s first line of defense against invading pathogens. Cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 2 (CMPK2) is a type I interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that exerts antiviral effects. However, the molecular mechanism by which CMPK2 inhibits viral replication is unclear. Here, we report that CMPK2 expression restricts Zika virus (ZIKV) replication by specifically inhibiting viral translation and that IFN-I- induced CMPK2 contributes significantly to the overall antiviral response against ZIKV. We demonstrate that expression of CMPK2 results in a significant decrease in the replication of other pathogenic flaviviruses including dengue virus (DENV-2), Kunjin virus (KUNV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Importantly, we determine that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of CMPK2, which lacks kinase activity, is sufficient to restrict viral translation. Thus, its kinase function is not required for CMPK2’s antiviral activity. Furthermore, we identify seven conserved cysteine residues within the NTD as critical for CMPK2 antiviral activity. Thus, these residues may form an unknown functional site in the NTD of CMPK2 contributing to its antiviral function. Finally, we show that mitochondrial localization of CMPK2 is required for its antiviral effects. Given its broad antiviral activity against flaviviruses, CMPK2 is a promising potential pan-flavivirus inhibitor.

TI  - CXCR4 antagonism increases T cell trafficking in the central nervous system and improves survival from West Nile virus encephalitis
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 105
SP  - 11270
EP  - 11275
AB  - The migration of lymphocytes into the CNS during viral encephalitis is hindered by the blood–brain barrier (BBB) such that most infiltrating cells remain localized to perivascular spaces. This sequestration of leukocytes away from the parenchyma is believed to protect the CNS from immunopathologic injury. Infections of the CNS with highly cytopathic neurotropic viruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV), however, require the parenchymal penetration of T lymphocytes for virus clearance and survival, suggesting that perivascular localization might hinder antiviral immune responses during WNV encephalitis. Using human and murine brain specimens from individuals with WNV encephalitis, we evaluated the expression of CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4, at the BBB and tested the hypothesis that inhibition of CXCR4 would promote T lymphocyte entry into the CNS parenchyma and increase viral clearance. Antagonism of CXCR4 significantly improved survival from lethal infection through enhanced intraparenchymal migration of WNV-specific CD8+ T cells within the brain, leading to reduced viral loads and, surprisingly, decreased immunopathology at this site. The benefits of enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration suggest that pharmacologic targeting of CXCR4 may have therapeutic utility for the treatment of acute viral infections of the CNS.

TI  - Capturing a Flavivirus Pre-Fusion Intermediate
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 5
AB  - During cell entry of flaviviruses, low endosomal pH triggers the rearrangement of the viral surface glycoproteins to a fusion-active state that allows the release of the infectious RNA into the cytoplasm. In this work, West Nile virus was complexed with Fab fragments of the neutralizing mAb E16 and was subsequently exposed to low pH, trapping the virions in a pre-fusion intermediate state. The structure of the complex was studied by cryo-electron microscopy and provides the first structural glimpse of a flavivirus fusion intermediate near physiological conditions. A radial expansion of the outer protein layer of the virion was observed compared to the structure at pH 8. The resulting ∼60 Å-wide shell of low density between lipid bilayer and outer protein layer is likely traversed by the stem region of the E glycoprotein. By using antibody fragments, we have captured a structural intermediate of a virus that likely occurs during cell entry. The trapping of structural transition states by antibody fragments will be applicable for other processes in the flavivirus life cycle and delineating other cellular events that involve conformational rearrangements.

TI  - Carboxy-terminal analysis of nine proteins specified by the flavivirus Kunjin: evidence that only the intracellular core protein is truncated.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 70 ( Pt 8)
SP  - 2209
EP  - 14
AB  - Nine proteins specified by Kunjin virus were labelled with [3H]lysine and digested with carboxypeptidase B which specifically cleaves carboxy-terminal Lys or Arg. The theoretical amount of [3H]lysine was released from the non-structural (ns) proteins NS2A, NS2B, NS3 and NS4B, which have a common carboxy terminus Lys-Arg deduced from cleavage sites established in the viral polyprotein by previous N-terminal amino acid analyses. This is a flavivirus consensus site, always followed by Gly, Ala or Ser. These results indicate that no truncations had occurred despite anomalous electrophoretic migrations of NS2A, NS2B and NS4B observed in some gel systems. No [3H]lysine was released from NS4A or NS5 which terminate in Ala and Leu, respectively, thus establishing that NS5 (observed Mr 98,000, theoretical Mr 103,600) was not cleaved post-translationally at any internal Lys-Arg site. Unexpectedly, [3H]lysine residues were apparently released from P14(C), the intracellular equivalent of virion C protein which terminates in Ala (adjacent to the established N-terminus of prM). However, a putative internal cleavage site (Lys-Arg decreases Gly) exists 18 residues upstream from the carboxy terminus of C, prior to the transmembrane spanning domain. Apparent internal cleavage in the cytosol at this site to produce P14(C) would expose [3H]lysine residues to carboxypeptidase B, and account for the previously observed differences in size and composition between C and P14(C).

TI  - Cell Proteins TIA-1 and TIAR Interact with the 3′ Stem-Loop of the West Nile Virus Complementary Minus-Strand RNA and Facilitate Virus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 76

EP  - 12000
AB  - ABSTRACT It was reported previously that four baby hamster kidney (BHK) proteins with molecular masses of 108, 60, 50, and 42 kDa bind specifically to the 3′-terminal stem-loop of the West Nile virus minus-stand RNA [WNV 3′(−) SL RNA] (P. Y. Shi, W. Li, and M. A. Brinton, J. Virol. 70:6278-6287, 1996). In this study, p42 was purified using an RNA affinity column and identified as TIAR by peptide sequencing. A 42-kDa UV-cross-linked viral RNA-cell protein complex formed in BHK cytoplasmic extracts incubated with the WNV 3′(−) SL RNA was immunoprecipitated by anti-TIAR antibody. Both TIAR and the closely related protein TIA-1 are members of the RNA recognition motif (RRM) family of RNA binding proteins. TIA-1 also binds to the WNV 3′(−) SL RNA. The specificity of these viral RNA-cell protein interactions was demonstrated using recombinant proteins in competition gel mobility shift assays. The binding site for the WNV 3′(−) SL RNA was mapped to RRM2 on both TIAR and TIA-1. However, the dissociation constant (Kd) for the interaction between TIAR RRM2 and the WNV 3′(−) SL RNA was 1.5 × 10−8, while that for TIA-1 RRM2 was 1.12 × 10−7. WNV growth was less efficient in murine TIAR knockout cell lines than in control cells. This effect was not observed for two other types of RNA viruses or two types of DNA viruses. Reconstitution of the TIAR knockout cells with TIAR increased the efficiency of WNV growth, but neither the level of TIAR nor WNV replication was as high as in control cells. These data suggest a functional role for TIAR and possibly also for TIA-1 during WNV replication.

TI  - Cell proteins bind specifically to West Nile virus minus-strand 3' stem-loop RNA
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 70
SP  - 6278
EP  - 6287
AB  - The first 96 nucleotides of the 5'noncoding region (NCR) of West Nile virus (WNV) genomic RNA were previously reported to form thermodynamically predicted stem-loop (SL) structures that are conserved among flaviviruses. The complementary minus-strand 3' NCR RNA, which is thought to function as a promoter for the synthesis of plus-strand RNA, forms a corresponding predicted SL structure. RNase probing of the WNV 3' minus-strand stem-loop RNA [WNV (-)3' SL RNA] confirmed the existence of a terminal secondary structure. RNA-protein binding studies were performed with BHK S100 cytoplasmic extracts and in vitro-synthesized WNV (-)3' SL RNA as the probe. Three RNA-protein complexes (complexes 1,2, and 3) were detected by a gel mobility shift assay, and the specificity of the RNA-protein interactions was confirmed by gel mobility shift and UV-induced cross-linking competition assays. Four BHK cell proteins with molecular masses of 108, 60, 50, and 42 kDa were detected by UV-induced cross-linking to the WNV (-)3' SL RNA. A preliminary mapping study indicated that all four proteins bound to the first 75 nucleotides of the WNV 3' minus-strand RNA, the region that contains the terminal SL. A flavivirus resistance phenotype was previously shown to be inherited in mice as a single, autosomal dominant allele. The efficiencies of infection of resistant cells and susceptible cells are similar, but resistant cells (C3H/RV) produce less genomic RNA than congenic, susceptible cells (C3H/He). Three RNA-protein complexes and four UV-induced cross-linked cell proteins with mobilities identical to those detected in BHK cell extracts with the WNV (-)3' SL RNA were found in both C3H/RV and C3H/He cell extracts. However, the half-life of the C3H/RV complex 1 was three times longer than that of the C3H/He complex 1. It is possible that the increased binding activity of one of the resistant cell proteins for the flavivirus minus-strand RNA could result in a reduced synthesis of plus-strand RNA as observed with the flavivirus resistance phenotype.

TI  - Cell-Specific IRF-3 Responses Protect against West Nile Virus Infection by Interferon-Dependent and -Independent Mechanisms
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 3
AB  - Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 is a master transcription factor that activates host antiviral defense programs. Although cell culture studies suggest that IRF-3 promotes antiviral control by inducing interferon (IFN)-β, near normal levels of IFN-α and IFN-β were observed in IRF-3−/− mice after infection by several RNA and DNA viruses. Thus, the specific mechanisms by which IRF-3 modulates viral infection remain controversial. Some of this disparity could reflect direct IRF-3-dependent antiviral responses in specific cell types to control infection. To address this and determine how IRF-3 coordinates an antiviral response, we infected IRF-3−/− mice and two primary cells relevant for West Nile virus (WNV) pathogenesis, macrophages and cortical neurons. IRF-3−/− mice were uniformly vulnerable to infection and developed elevated WNV burdens in peripheral and central nervous system tissues, though peripheral IFN responses were largely normal. Whereas wild-type macrophages basally expressed key host defense molecules, including RIG-I, MDA5, ISG54, and ISG56, and restricted WNV infection, IRF-3−/− macrophages lacked basal expression of these host defense genes and supported increased WNV infection and IFN-α and IFN-β production. In contrast, wild-type cortical neurons were highly permissive to WNV and did not basally express RIG-I, MDA5, ISG54, and ISG56. IRF-3−/− neurons lacked induction of host defense genes and had blunted IFN-α and IFN-β production, yet exhibited only modestly increased viral titers. Collectively, our data suggest that cell-specific IRF-3 responses protect against WNV infection through both IFN-dependent and -independent programs.

TI  - Cell-associated West Nile flavivirus is covered with E+pre-M protein heterodimers which are destroyed and reorganized by proteolytic cleavage during virus release
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 63
SP  - 2521
EP  - 2526
AB  - Flaviviruses are enveloped viruses which accumulate in cellular vacuoles prior to release. The membrane of cell-associated virus contains the proteins pre-M and E. During release of virus the pre-M protein is cleaved, and only its carboxy-terminal segment remains associated with the virus as M protein. Studies of the association of membrane proteins of intracellular and extracellular particles of West Nile virus show that in cell-associated virus the pre-M and E proteins are present as E+pre-M heterodimers. Cleavage of pre-M during release leads to dissociation of the heterodimers: the amino-terminal region of the pre-M protein is lost from the virus, whereas the proteins M and E remain associated with the viral membrane as separate molecules. The E protein of extracellular virus has a tendency to oligomerize into trimers, and both E-protein monomers and trimers are present on extracellular virions. We have prepared partially purified extracellular virus without loss of viral infectivity. These preparations contain approximately 600 physical particles for each PFU. Since purification of cell-associated virus results in significant loss of PFU, an inactivation of virus may occur during this procedure. Preparations of cell-associated virus contained approximately 40,000 physical particles for each PFU.

TI  - Cellular Inflammatory Response to Flaviviruses in the Central Nervous System of a Primate Host
JF  - Journal of Histochemistry & Cytochemistry
VL  - 57
SP  - 973
EP  - 989
AB  - Flaviviruses such as tick-borne encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus are important neurotropic human pathogens, typically causing a devastating and often fatal neuroinfection. Flaviviruses induce neuroinflammation with typical features of viral encephalitides, including inflammatory cell infiltration, activation of microglia, and neuronal degeneration. Development of safe and effective live-virus vaccines against neurotropic flavivirus infections demands a detailed knowledge of their neuropathogenesis in a primate host that is evolutionarily close to humans. Here, we used computerized morphometric analysis to quantitatively assess the cellular inflammatory responses in the central nervous system (CNS) of rhesus monkeys infected with three antigenically divergent attenuated flaviviruses. The kinetics, spatial pattern, and magnitude of microglial activation, trafficking of T and B cells, and changes in T cell subsets within the CNS define unique phenotypic signatures for each of the three viruses. Our results provide a benchmark for investigation of cellular inflammatory responses induced by attenuated flaviviruses in the CNS of primate hosts and provide insight into the neuropathogenesis of flavivirus encephalitis that might guide the development of safe and effective live-virus vaccines.

TI  - Cellular NONO protein binds to the flavivirus replication complex and promotes positive-strand RNA synthesis.
JF  - Journal of virology
SP  - e0029724
EP  - 
AB  - A cellular protein, non-POU-domain-containing octamer binding protein (NONO), bound to the replication complex of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) by directly interacting with the viral 3' UTR RNA and NS3 protein. These interactions were also identified in West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). The infection of JEV or the expression of JEV NS3 protein in cells could induce relocation of NONO protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In JEV-infected cells, the NS3, NS5, and viral RNA could be concurrently detected in the immunoprecipitation by the NONO-specific antibody, suggesting that NONO could integrate into the replication complex of JEV. Further results of co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that NONO protein interacted with NS3 helicase domains 1 and 2 by its two RNA recognize motifs (RRMs). The knockdown and knockout of NONO in cells could significantly reduce the replication of JEV and ZIKV but had no effect on the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The effect of NONO protein on JEV proliferation occurred during the replication stage, rather than the attachment and entry stages. The level of viral positive-strand RNA in NONO knockout cells was significantly reduced than that in wild-type cells at 12-48 h post-JEV infection. However, the level of negative-strand virus RNA had no difference between NONO knockout and wild-type cells at 12-24 h post-infection. In summary, our study identified a cellular protein that bound to the replication complex of flavivirus and facilitated the synthesis of positive-strand RNA.IMPORTANCEOver half of the world's population is at risk of flaviviruses infection, posing a serious global health concern. To date, there are no antiviral drugs or treatments for the severe symptoms caused by the infection of flaviviruses. Some cellular proteins could participate in the replication of virus, and these cellular proteins were also ideal targets in antiviral strategy. Here, we identified cellular NONO protein was recruited by flavivirus NS3 protein to the cytoplasm, serving as a "scaffold" for viral replication complex. Our findings also revealed that NONO protein was critical for flavivirus positive-strand RNA synthesis. Specific areas where NONO interacted with flavivirus NS3 proteins and viral UTRs have also been identified. These results propose a new mechanism for cellular protein to participate in flavivirus replication and also raise a new potential anti-flavivirus strategy.

TI  - Cellular microRNA-155 Regulates Virus-Induced Inflammatory Response and Protects against Lethal West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that has disseminated globally as a significant cause of viral encephalitis in humans. MircoRNA-155 (miR-155) regulates various aspects of innate and adaptive immune responses. We previously reported that WNV infection induces upregulation of miR-155 in mice brains. In the current study, we demonstrate the critical role of miR-155 in restricting the pathogenesis of WNV infection in mice. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, miR-155 knockout mice exhibited significantly higher morbidity and mortality after infection with either a lethal strain, WNV NY99, or a non-lethal strain, WNV Eg101. Increased mortality in miR-155−/− mice was associated with significantly high WNV burden in the serum and brains. Protein levels of interferon (IFN)-α in the serum and brains were higher in miR-155−/− mice. However, miR-155−/− mice exhibited significantly lower protein levels of anti-viral interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-12, IL-6, IL-15, and GM-CSF despite the high viral load. Primary mouse cells lacking miR-155 were more susceptible to infection with WNV compared to cells derived from WT mice. Besides, overexpression of miR-155 in human neuronal cells modulated anti-viral cytokine response and resulted in significantly lower WNV replication. These data collectively indicate that miR-155 restricts WNV production in mouse and human cells and protects against lethal WNV infection in mice.

TI  - Characterization of RyDEN (C19orf66) as an Interferon-Stimulated Cellular Inhibitor against Dengue Virus Replication
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most important arthropod-borne pathogens that cause life-threatening diseases in humans. However, no vaccine or specific antiviral is available for dengue. As seen in other RNA viruses, the innate immune system plays a key role in controlling DENV infection and disease outcome. Although the interferon (IFN) response, which is central to host protective immunity, has been reported to limit DENV replication, the molecular details of how DENV infection is modulated by IFN treatment are elusive. In this study, by employing a gain-of-function screen using a type I IFN-treated cell-derived cDNA library, we identified a previously uncharacterized gene, C19orf66, as an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) that inhibits DENV replication, which we named Repressor of yield of DENV (RyDEN). Overexpression and gene knockdown experiments revealed that expression of RyDEN confers resistance to all serotypes of DENV in human cells. RyDEN expression also limited the replication of hepatitis C virus, Kunjin virus, Chikungunya virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and human adenovirus. Importantly, RyDEN was considered to be a crucial effector molecule in the IFN-mediated anti-DENV response. When affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis was performed, RyDEN was revealed to form a complex with cellular mRNA-binding proteins, poly(A)-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), and La motif-related protein 1 (LARP1). Interestingly, PABPC1 and LARP1 were found to be positive modulators of DENV replication. Since RyDEN influenced intracellular events on DENV replication and, suppression of protein synthesis from DENV-based reporter construct RNA was also observed in RyDEN-expressing cells, our data suggest that RyDEN is likely to interfere with the translation of DENV via interaction with viral RNA and cellular mRNA-binding proteins, resulting in the inhibition of virus replication in infected cells.

JF  - Journal of NeuroVirology
VL  - 11
SP  - 11
EP  - 22
AB  - The North American West Nile virus (WNV), New York 1999 strain, appears to be highly neurotropic, and its neuroinvasiveness is an important aspect of human disease. The authors have developed an in vitro model to study WNV replication and protein processing in neurons. They compared WNV infection of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (sensory neurons) and PC-12 cells (sympathetic neurons) to WNV infection of the mosquito cell line, C6/36, and Vero cells. WNV infection of both neuronal cell types and C6/36 cells was not cytopathic up to 30 days post infection, and continual viral shedding was observed during this period. However, WNV infection of Vero cells was lytic. Interestingly, WNV infection of neurons was not efficient, requiring a high multiplicity of infection of ≥10. Indirect immunofluorescence assays using normal and confocal microscopy with flavivirus-reactive antibodies and WNV-infected neurons demonstrated viral antigen mostly associated with the plasma membrane and in the neurite processes. Treatment of WNV-infected C6/36, PC-12, or DRG cells with brefeldin A (BFA; a trans-Golgi inhibitor) or nocadazole (a β-tubulin inhibitor) had little effect on viral maturation and secretion. Treatment of WNV-infected Vero cells with BFA resulted in a 1000-fold decrease in viral titer, but nocodazole had no effect. Our studies suggest that even though PC-12 and DRG neurons are mammalian cells, viral protein processing and maturation in these cells more closely resembles replication in C6/36 insect cells than in mammalian Vero cells.

AB  - To facilitate further studies of flavivirus transcription, cell extraction methods and in vitro reaction conditions which increased West Nile virus (WNV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity were determined. Subcellular fractions from WNV-infected BHK-21/W12 cells were characterized with regard to their protein and RNA content and in vitro polymerase activity. In both a cytoplasmic fraction, designated S1, and a fraction enriched for outer nuclear membranes, designated S2, seven virus-specific proteins, NS5 (96 kilodaltons [kDa]), NS3 (67 kDa), E (48 kDa), NS1 (47 kDa), ns4a (26 kDa), ns2a (17 kDa), and ns2b (14.5 kDa), were detected. The fractions also contained virus-specific RNA and cellular rRNA and mRNA. Polymerase activity in S1 and S2 fractions from WNV-infected cells was concentrated by pelleting and consisted of two types of enzyme activities: the WNV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and terminal transferases of cellular origin. Enhanced levels of WNV polymerase activity were obtained from these cell fractions by altering several of the in vitro reaction conditions. Although Mg2+ was the divalent cation preferred by WNV polymerase, virus-specific in vitro transcription was detected at reduced levels when Mn2+ (0.05 or 0.5 mM) was present as the sole divalent cation. Product analysis revealed that the viral polymerase incorporated radiolabeled ribonucleotides into three distinct RNA species. Free single-stranded genome-sized RNA which was LiCl insoluble and RNase sensitive was found by fingerprint analysis to have an oligonucleotide pattern similar to that of WNV genomic RNA. RNA molecules which comigrated as a broad band near the top of the gel were separable into LiCl-insoluble, partially RNase-sensitive replicative-intermediate RNA and LiCl-soluble, RNase-resistant replicative-form RNA. The cellular transferases added UMP or AMP residues to the 3'-termini of cellular mRNA, tRNA, and 18S and 28S rRNA. Although a cellular terminal transferase has been reported to function in initiation of poliovirus transcription, no labeling of the WNV RNA by either of these cellular enzymes was detected. Therefore, they appear to play no specific role in flavivirus RNA synthesis.

AB  - Vero cells were infected by Kunjin virus and radiolabelled in the presence of the leucine analogue, threo-beta-hydroxy-DL-leucine (THL). This analogue is known to prevent preprotein processing in cell-free systems when incorporated into signal peptides. Novel Kunjin virus-specified proteins were detected, namely gp140, p120 and gp92; the designations for the proteins indicate their approximate Mr X 10(-3) and whether they are glycosylated. The glycoproteins gp140 and gp92 were observed in cells labelled with [3H]mannose and bound to concanavalin A. Limited proteolytic digestion of gp140, gp92 and gp66 (related to the envelope protein E), and tryptic peptide mapping of these three glycoproteins and p120 indicated that all four were closely related. The glycoproteins gp140 and gp92 were also detected in cells infected by West Nile virus radiolabelled in the presence of THL. Other effects of THL in Kunjin virus-infected cells were a reduction in the incorporation of radioactive amino acids or mannose, a decrease in the yield of haemagglutinin and infectious virus, an inhibition of processing of gp66 to gp53 and an apparent inhibition of synthesis of P98 and P71. We suggest possible explanations for the THL-induced changes in infected cells based on recent models proposed for the synthesis of the yellow fever and West Nile viral proteins.

TI  - Chemokine Receptor Ccr2 Is Critical for Monocyte Accumulation and Survival in West Nile Virus Encephalitis
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 186
SP  - 471
EP  - 478
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a re-emerging pathogen responsible for outbreaks of fatal meningoencephalitis in humans. Previous studies have suggested a protective role for monocytes in a mouse model of WNV infection, but the molecular mechanisms have remained unclear. In this study, we show that genetic deficiency in Ccr2, a chemokine receptor on Ly6chi inflammatory monocytes and other leukocyte subtypes, markedly increases mortality due to WNV encephalitis in C57BL/6 mice; this was associated with a large and selective reduction of Ly6chi monocyte accumulation in the brain. WNV infection in Ccr2+/+ mice induced a strong and highly selective monocytosis in peripheral blood that was absent in Ccr2−/− mice, which in contrast showed sustained monocytopenia. When a 1:1 mixture of Ccr2+/+ and Ccr2−/− donor monocytes was transferred by vein into WNV-infected Ccr2−/− recipient mice, monocyte accumulation in the CNS was not skewed toward either component of the mixture, indicating that Ccr2 is not required for trafficking of monocytes from blood to brain. We conclude that Ccr2 mediates highly selective peripheral blood monocytosis during WNV infection of mice and that this is critical for accumulation of monocytes in the brain.

TI  - Chemokine Receptor Ccr7 Restricts Fatal West Nile Virus Encephalitis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that can cause debilitating encephalitis. To delineate the mechanisms behind this pathology, we studied Ccr7-deficient mice, which afforded us the capacity to study infection in mice with disrupted peripheral cellular trafficking events. The loss of Ccr7 resulted in an immediate pan-leukocytosis that remained elevated throughout the infection. This leukocytosis resulted in a significant enhancement of leukocyte accumulation within the central nervous system (CNS). Despite an excess of virus-specific T cells in the CNS, Ccr7-deficient mice had significantly higher CNS viral loads and mortality rates than wild-type animals. Mechanistically, the elevated trafficking of infected myeloid cells into the brain in Ccr7-deficient mice resulted in increased levels of WNV in the CNS, thereby effectively contributing to neuroinflammation and lowering viral clearance. Combined, our experiments suggest that during WNV infection, Ccr7 is a gatekeeper for nonspecific viral transference to the brain. IMPORTANCE In this study, we show that Ccr7 is required for the sufficient migration of dendritic cells and T cells into the draining lymph node immediately following infection and for the restriction of leukocyte migration into the brain. Further, the severe loss of dendritic cells in the draining lymph node had no impact on viral replication in this organ, suggesting that WNV may migrate from the skin into the lymph node through another mechanism. Most importantly, we found that the loss of Ccr7 results in a significant leukocytosis, leading to hypercellularity within the CNS, where monocytes/macrophages contribute to CNS viremia, neuroinflammation, and increased mortality. Together, our data point to Ccr7 as a critical host defense restriction factor limiting neuroinflammation during acute viral infection.

TI  - Chemokine receptor CCR5 promotes leukocyte trafficking to the brain and survival in West Nile virus infection
JF  - The Journal of Experimental Medicine
VL  - 202
SP  - 1087
EP  - 1098
AB  - The molecular immunopathogenesis of West Nile virus (WNV) infection is poorly understood. Here, we characterize a mouse model for WNV using a subcutaneous route of infection and delineate leukocyte subsets and immunoregulatory factors present in the brains of infected mice. Central nervous system (CNS) expression of the chemokine receptor CCR5 and its ligand CCL5 was prominently up-regulated by WNV, and this was associated with CNS infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK1.1+ cells and macrophages expressing the receptor. The significance of CCR5 in pathogenesis was established by mortality studies in which infection of CCR5−/− mice was rapidly and uniformly fatal. In the brain, WNV-infected CCR5−/− mice had increased viral burden but markedly reduced NK1.1+ cells, macrophages, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared with WNV-infected CCR5+/+ mice. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from WNV-infected CCR5+/+ mice into infected CCR5−/− mice increased leukocyte accumulation in the CNS compared with transfer of splenocytes from infected CCR5−/− mice into infected CCR5−/− mice, and increased survival to 60%, the same as in infected CCR5+/+ control mice. We conclude that CCR5 is a critical antiviral and survival determinant in WNV infection of mice that acts by regulating trafficking of leukocytes to the infected brain.

TI  - Chimeric viruses between Rocio and West Nile: the role for Rocio prM-E proteins in virulence and inhibition of interferon-α/β signaling
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Mosquito-transmitted flavivirus Rocio (ROCV) was responsible for an outbreak of encephalitis in the Ribeira Valley, located in the south coast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil, in 1975–1976. ROCV also causes fatal encephalitis in adult mice. Seroprevalence studies in humans, horses and water buffaloes in different regions of Brazil have suggested that ROCV is still circulating in the country, indicating the risk of re-emergence of this virus. West Nile virus (WNV) is also a mosquito-transmitted encephalitic flavivirus, however, WNV strains circulating in Australia have not been associated with outbreaks of disease in humans and exhibit low virulence in adult mice. To identify viral determinants of ROCV virulence, we have generated reciprocal chimeric viruses between ROCV and the Australian strain of WNV by swapping structural prM and E genes. Chimeric WNV containing ROCV prM-E genes replicated more efficiently than WNV or chimeric ROCV containing WNV prM-E genes in mammalian cells, was as virulent as ROCV in adult mice, and inhibited type I IFN signaling as efficiently as ROCV. The results show that ROCV prM and E proteins are major virulence determinants and identify unexpected function of these proteins in inhibition of type I interferon response.

TI  - Chronic Toxoplasma gondii infection curtails the cytotoxic potential of acute T cell responses to West Nile virus in the brain
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), a common brain-tropic parasite, chronically infects the central nervous system (CNS) of up to a third of the world’s population. Constant immune surveillance interrupts cyst reactivation within the CNS and dramatically alters the immune landscape of the brain. West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne infection with a clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic to mild flu-like symptoms to severe neuroinvasive disease. In a cohort of WNV infected people, we discovered a positive correlation between WNV disease severity and T. gondii seropositivity. In a mouse model pairing chronic T. gondii with acute WNV infection, we found an increased susceptibility of mice to WNV, with reduced granzyme B expression in WNV-specific T cells and increased regulatory T cell (Treg) numbers in the brain, but not the periphery. This demonstrates that the T. gondii-infected tissue microenvironment impairs immune defense against other brain infections by blunting local T cell responses.

TI  - Class II ADP-ribosylation Factors Are Required for Efficient Secretion of Dengue Viruses*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 287
SP  - 767
EP  - 777
AB  - Background: To date, very few cellular factors required for secretion of flaviviruses have been described. Results: Simultaneous depletion of class II Arf (Arf4 and Arf5) blocks dengue flavivirus secretion, without altering the constitutive secretory pathway. Dengue glycoprotein prM interacts with Arf4 and Arf5. Conclusion: Arf4 and Arf5 play a crucial role in dengue flavivirus secretion. Significance: Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism of dengue flavivirus secretion. Identification and characterization of virus-host interactions are very important steps toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for disease progression and pathogenesis. To date, very few cellular factors involved in the life cycle of flaviviruses, which are important human pathogens, have been described. In this study, we demonstrate a crucial role for class II Arf proteins (Arf4 and Arf5) in the dengue flavivirus life cycle. We show that simultaneous depletion of Arf4 and Arf5 blocks recombinant subviral particle secretion for all four dengue serotypes. Immunostaining analysis suggests that class II Arf proteins are required at an early pre-Golgi step for dengue virus secretion. Using a horseradish peroxidase protein fused to a signal peptide, we show that class II Arfs act specifically on dengue virus secretion without altering the secretion of proteins through the constitutive secretory pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation data demonstrate that the dengue prM glycoprotein interacts with class II Arf proteins but not through its C-terminal VXPX motif. Finally, experiments performed with replication-competent dengue and yellow fever viruses demonstrate that the depletion of class II Arfs inhibits virus secretion, thus confirming their implication in the virus life cycle, although data obtained with West Nile virus pointed out the differences in virus-host interactions among flaviviruses. Our findings shed new light on a molecular mechanism used by dengue viruses during the late stages of the life cycle and demonstrate a novel function for class II Arf proteins.

JF  - The Biochemical journal
VL  - 401 3
SP  - 743
EP  - 52
AB  - Regulated proteolysis of the polyprotein precursor by the NS2B-NS3 protease is required for the propagation of infectious virions. Unless the structural and functional parameters of NS2B-NS3 are precisely determined, an understanding of its functional role and the design of flaviviral inhibitors will be exceedingly difficult. Our objectives were to define the substrate recognition pattern of the NS2B-NS3 protease of West Nile and Dengue virises (WNV and DV respectively). To accomplish our goals, we used an efficient, 96-well plate format, method for the synthesis of 9-mer peptide substrates with the general P4-P3-P2-P1-P1'-P2'-P3'-P4'-Gly structure. The N-terminus and the constant C-terminal Gly of the peptides were tagged with a fluorescent tag and with a biotin tag respectively. The synthesis was followed by the proteolytic cleavage of the synthesized, tagged peptides. Because of the strict requirement for the presence of basic amino acid residues at the P1 and the P2 substrate positions, the analysis of approx. 300 peptide sequences was sufficient for an adequate representation of the cleavage preferences of the WNV and DV proteinases. Our results disclosed the strict substrate specificity of the WNV protease for which the (K/R)(K/R)R/GG amino acid motifs was optimal. The DV protease was less selective and it tolerated well the presence of a number of amino acid residue types at either the P1' or the P2' site, as long as the other position was occupied by a glycine residue. We believe that our data represent a valuable biochemical resource and a solid foundation to support the design of selective substrates and synthetic inhibitors of flaviviral proteinases.

JF  - The Biochemical journal
VL  - 393 Pt 2
SP  - 503
EP  - 11
AB  - Mosquito-borne WNV (West Nile virus) is an emerging global threat. The NS3 proteinase, which is essential for the proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein precursor, is a promising drug target. We have isolated and biochemically characterized the recombinant, highly active NS3 proteinase. We have determined that the NS3 proteinase functions in a manner that is distantly similar to furin in cleaving the peptide and protein substrates. We determined that aprotinin and D-arginine-based 9-12-mer peptides are potent inhibitors of WNV NS3 with K(i) values of 26 nM and 1 nM respectively. Consistent with the essential role of NS3 activity in the life cycle of WNV and with the sensitivity of NS3 activity to the D-arginine-based peptides, we showed that nona-D-Arg-NH2 reduced WNV infection in primary neurons. We have also shown that myelin basic protein, a deficiency of which is linked to neurological abnormalities of the brain, is sensitive to NS3 proteolysis in vitro and therefore this protein represents a convenient test substrate for the studies of NS3. A three-dimensional model of WNV NS3 that we created may provide a structural guidance and a rationale for the subsequent design of fine-tuned inhibitors. Overall, our findings represent a foundation for in-depth mechanistic and structural studies as well as for the design of novel and efficient inhibitors of WNV NS3.

TI  - Combined Analysis of Multi-Study miRNA and mRNA Expression Data Shows Overlap of Selected miRNAs Involved in West Nile Virus Infections
JF  - Genes
VL  - 15
AB  - The emerging zoonotic West Nile virus (WNV) has serious impact on public health. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of WNV infections in mammalian hosts is important to develop improved diagnostic and treatment strategies. In this context, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been analyzed by several studies under different conditions and with different outcomes. A systematic comparison is therefore necessary. Furthermore, additional information from mRNA target expression data has rarely been taken into account to understand miRNA expression profiles under WNV infections. We conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available miRNA expression data from multiple independent studies, and analyzed them in a harmonized way to increase comparability. In addition, we used gene-set tests on mRNA target expression data to further gain evidence about differentially expressed miRNAs. For this purpose, we also studied the use of target information from different databases. We detected a substantial number of miRNA that emerged as differentially expressed from several miRNA datasets, and from the mRNA target data analysis as well. When using mRNA target data, we found that the targetscan databases provided the most useful information. We demonstrated improved miRNA detection through research synthesis of multiple independent miRNA datasets coupled with mRNA target set testing, leading to the discovery of multiple miRNAs which should be taken into account for further research on the molecular mechanism of WNV infections.

TI  - Common E Protein Determinants for Attenuation of Glycosaminoglycan-Binding Variants of Japanese Encephalitis and West Nile Viruses
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 8271
EP  - 8280
AB  - ABSTRACT Natural isolates and laboratory strains of West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) were attenuated for neuroinvasiveness in mouse models for flavivirus encephalitis by serial passage in human adenocarcinoma (SW13) cells. The passage variants displayed a small-plaque phenotype, augmented affinity for heparin-Sepharose, and a marked increase in specific infectivity for SW13 cells relative to the respective parental viruses, while the specific infectivity for Vero cells was not altered. Therefore, host cell adaptation of passage variants was most likely a consequence of altered receptor usage for virus attachment-entry with the involvement of cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in this process. In vivo blood clearance kinetics of the passage variants was markedly faster and viremia was reduced relative to the parental viruses, suggesting that affinity for GAG (ubiquitously present on cell surfaces and extracellular matrices) is a key determinant for the neuroinvasiveness of encephalitic flaviviruses. A difference in pathogenesis between WNV and JEV, which was reflected in more efficient growth in the spleen and liver of the WNV parent and passage variants, accounted for a less pronounced loss of neuroinvasiveness of GAG binding variants of WNV than JEV. Single gain-of-net-positive-charge amino acid changes at E protein residue 49, 138, 306, or 389/390, putatively positioned in two clusters on the virion surface, define molecular determinants for GAG binding and concomitant virulence attenuation that are shared by the JEV serotype flaviviruses.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 76

EP  - 10775
AB  - ABSTRACT We have previously reported successful trans-complementation of defective Kunjin virus genomic RNAs with a range of large lethal deletions in the nonstructural genes NS1, NS3, and NS5 (A. A. Khromykh et al., J. Virol. 74:3253-3263, 2000). In this study we have mapped further the minimal region in the NS5 gene essential for efficient trans-complementation of genome-length RNAs in repBHK cells to the first 316 of the 905 codons. To allow amplification and easy detection of complemented defective RNAs with deletions apparently affecting virus assembly, we have developed a dual replicon complementation system. In this system defective replicon RNAs with a deletion(s) in the nonstructural genes also encoded the puromycin resistance gene (PAC gene) and the reporter gene for β-galactosidase (β-Gal). Complementation of these defective replicon RNAs in repBHK cells resulted in expression of PAC and β-Gal which allowed establishment of cell lines stably producing replicating defective RNAs by selection with puromycin and comparison of replication efficiencies of complemented defective RNAs by β-Gal assay. Using this system we demonstrated that deletions in the C-terminal 434 codons of NS3 (codons 178 to 611) were complemented for RNA replication, while any deletions in the first 178 codons were not. None of the genome-length RNAs containing deletions in NS3 shown to be complementable for RNA replication produced secreted defective viruses during complementation in repBHK cells. In contrast, structural proteins produced from these complemented defective RNAs were able to package helper replicon RNA. The results define minimal regions in the NS3 and NS5 genes essential for the formation of complementable replication complex and show a requirement of NS3 in cis for virus assembly.

AB  - ABSTRACT The molecular mechanisms that define the specificity of flavivirus RNA encapsulation are poorly understood. Virions composed of the structural proteins of one flavivirus and the genomic RNA of a heterologous strain can be assembled and have been developed as live attenuated vaccine candidates for several flaviviruses. In this study, we discovered that not all combinations of flavivirus components are possible. While a West Nile virus (WNV) subgenomic RNA could readily be packaged by structural proteins of the DENV2 strain 16681, production of infectious virions with DENV2 strain New Guinea C (NGC) structural proteins was not possible, despite the very high amino acid identity between these viruses. Mutagenesis studies identified a single residue (position 101) of the DENV capsid (C) protein as the determinant for heterologous virus production. C101 is located at the P1′ position of the NS2B/3 protease cleavage site at the carboxy terminus of the C protein. WNV NS2B/3 cleavage of the DENV structural polyprotein was possible when a threonine (Thr101 in strain 16681) but not a serine (Ser101 in strain NGC) occupied the P1′ position, a finding not predicted by in vitro protease specificity studies. Critically, both serine and threonine were tolerated at the P1′ position of WNV capsid. More extensive mutagenesis revealed the importance of flanking residues within the polyprotein in defining the cleavage specificity of the WNV protease. A more detailed understanding of the context dependence of viral protease specificity may aid the development of new protease inhibitors and provide insight into associated patterns of drug resistance. IMPORTANCE West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses that cause considerable morbidity and mortality in humans. No specific antiflavivirus therapeutics are available for treatment of infection. Proteolytic processing of the flavivirus polyprotein is an essential step in the replication cycle and is an attractive target for antiviral development. The design of protease inhibitors has been informed by insights into the molecular details of the interactions of proteases and their substrates. In this article, studies of the processing of WNV and DENV capsid proteins by the WNV protease identified an unexpected contribution of the sequence surrounding critical residues within the cleavage site on protease specificity. This demonstration of context-dependent protease cleavage has implications for the design of chimeric flaviviruses, new therapeutics, and the interpretation of flavivirus protease substrate specificity studies.

TI  - Coupling between Replication and Packaging of Flavivirus RNA: Evidence Derived from the Use of DNA-Based Full-Length cDNA Clones of Kunjin Virus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 75
SP  - 4633
EP  - 4640
AB  - ABSTRACT In order to study whether flavivirus RNA packaging is dependent on RNA replication, we generated two DNA-based Kunjin virus constructs, pKUN1 and pKUN1dGDD, allowing continuous production of replicating (wild-type) and nonreplicating (with a deletion of the NS5 gene RNA-polymerase motif GDD) full-length Kunjin virus RNAs, respectively, via nuclear transcription by cellular RNA polymerase II. As expected, transfection of pKUN1 plasmid DNA into BHK cells resulted in the recovery of secreted infectious Kunjin virions. Transfection of pKUN1dGDD DNA into BHK cells, however, did not result in the recovery of any secreted virus particles containing encapsidated dGDD RNA, despite an apparent accumulation of this RNA in cells demonstrated by Northern blot analysis and its efficient translation demonstrated by detection of correctly processed labeled structural proteins (at least prM and E) both in cells and in the culture fluid using coimmunoprecipitation analysis with anti-E antibodies. In contrast, when dGDD RNA was produced even in much smaller amounts in pKUN1dGDD DNA-transfected repBHK cells (where it was replicated via complementation), it was packaged into secreted virus particles. Thus, packaging of defective Kunjin virus RNA could occur only when it was replicated. Our results with genome-length Kunjin virus RNA and the results with poliovirus replicon RNA (C. I. Nugent et al., J. Virol. 73:427–435, 1999), both demonstrating the necessity for the RNA to be replicated before it can be packaged, strongly suggest the existence of a common mechanism for minimizing amplification and transmission of defective RNAs among the quasispecies in positive-strand RNA viruses. This mechanism may thus help alleviate the high-copy error rate of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.

TI  - Crystal Structure of West Nile Virus Envelope Glycoprotein Reveals Viral Surface Epitopes

VL  - 80

EP  - 11008
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus, a member of the Flavivirus genus, causes fever that can progress to life-threatening encephalitis. The major envelope glycoprotein, E, of these viruses mediates viral attachment and entry by membrane fusion. We have determined the crystal structure of a soluble fragment of West Nile virus E. The structure adopts the same overall fold as that of the E proteins from dengue and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. The conformation of domain II is different from that in other prefusion E structures, however, and resembles the conformation of domain II in postfusion E structures. The epitopes of neutralizing West Nile virus-specific antibodies map to a region of domain III that is exposed on the viral surface and has been implicated in receptor binding. In contrast, we show that certain recombinant therapeutic antibodies, which cross-neutralize West Nile and dengue viruses, bind a peptide from domain I that is exposed only during the membrane fusion transition. By revealing the details of the molecular landscape of the West Nile virus surface, our structure will assist the design of antiviral vaccines and therapeutics.

TI  - Crystal Structure of a Novel Conformational State of the Flavivirus NS3 Protein: Implications for Polyprotein Processing and Viral Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83
SP  - 12895
EP  - 12906
AB  - ABSTRACT The flavivirus genome comprises a single strand of positive-sense RNA, which is translated into a polyprotein and cleaved by a combination of viral and host proteases to yield functional proteins. One of these, nonstructural protein 3 (NS3), is an enzyme with both serine protease and NTPase/helicase activities. NS3 plays a central role in the flavivirus life cycle: the NS3 N-terminal serine protease together with its essential cofactor NS2B is involved in the processing of the polyprotein, whereas the NS3 C-terminal NTPase/helicase is responsible for ATP-dependent RNA strand separation during replication. An unresolved question remains regarding why NS3 appears to encode two apparently disconnected functionalities within one protein. Here we report the 2.75-Å-resolution crystal structure of full-length Murray Valley encephalitis virus NS3 fused with the protease activation peptide of NS2B. The biochemical characterization of this construct suggests that the protease has little influence on the helicase activity and vice versa. This finding is in agreement with the structural data, revealing a single protein with two essentially segregated globular domains. Comparison of the structure with that of dengue virus type 4 NS2B-NS3 reveals a relative orientation of the two domains that is radically different between the two structures. Our analysis suggests that the relative domain-domain orientation in NS3 is highly variable and dictated by a flexible interdomain linker. The possible implications of this conformational flexibility for the function of NS3 are discussed.

JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry

EP  - 10689
AB  - Viruses of the family Flaviviridae are important human and animal pathogens. Among them, the Flaviviruses dengue (DENV) and West Nile (WNV) cause regular outbreaks with fatal outcomes. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity of the non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is a key activity for viral RNA replication. In this study, crystal structures of enzymatically active and inactive WNV RdRp domains were determined at 3.0- and 2.35-Å resolution, respectively. The determined structures were shown to be mostly similar to the RdRps of the Flaviviridae members hepatitis C and bovine viral diarrhea virus, although with unique elements characteristic for the WNV RdRp. Using a reverse genetic system, residues involved in putative interactions between the RNA-cap methyltransferase (MTase) and the RdRp domain of Flavivirus NS5 were identified. This allowed us to propose a model for the structure of the full-length WNV NS5 by in silico docking of the WNV MTase domain (modeled from our previously determined structure of the DENV MTase domain) onto the RdRp domain. The Flavivirus RdRp domain structure determined here should facilitate both the design of anti-Flavivirus drugs and structure-function studies of the Flavivirus replication complex in which the multifunctional NS5 protein plays a central role.

EP  - 11474
AB  - ABSTRACT The envelope glycoprotein (E) of West Nile virus (WNV) undergoes a conformational rearrangement triggered by low pH that results in a class II fusion event required for viral entry. Herein we present the 3.0-Å crystal structure of the ectodomain of WNV E, which reveals insights into the flavivirus life cycle. We found that WNV E adopts a three-domain architecture that is shared by the E proteins from dengue and tick-borne encephalitis viruses and forms a rod-shaped configuration similar to that observed in immature flavivirus particles. Interestingly, the single N-linked glycosylation site on WNV E is displaced by a novel α-helix, which could potentially alter lectin-mediated attachment. The localization of histidines within the hinge regions of E implicates these residues in pH-induced conformational transitions. Most strikingly, the WNV E ectodomain crystallized as a monomer, in contrast to other flavivirus E proteins, which have crystallized as antiparallel dimers. WNV E assembles in a crystalline lattice of perpendicular molecules, with the fusion loop of one E protein buried in a hydrophobic pocket at the DI-DIII interface of another. Dimeric E proteins pack their fusion loops into analogous pockets at the dimer interface. We speculate that E proteins could pivot around the fusion loop-pocket junction, allowing virion conformational transitions while minimizing fusion loop exposure.

AB  - West Nile virus, a human pathogen, is closely related to other medically important flaviviruses of global impact such as dengue virus. The infectious virus was purified from cell culture using polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and density-gradient centrifugation. Thin amorphously shaped crystals of the lipid-enveloped virus were grown in quartz capillaries equilibrated by vapor diffusion. Crystal diffraction extended at best to a resolution of about 25 A using synchrotron radiation. A preliminary analysis of the diffraction images indicated that the crystals had unit-cell parameters a approximately b approximately 480 A, gamma = 120 degrees , suggesting a tight hexagonal packing of one virus particle per unit cell.

TI  - Culex Mosquito Piwi4 Is Antiviral against Two Negative-Sense RNA Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Culex spp. mosquitoes transmit several pathogens concerning public health, including West Nile virus and Saint Louis encephalitis virus. Understanding the antiviral immune system of Culex spp. mosquitoes is important for reducing the transmission of these viruses. Mosquitoes rely on RNA interference (RNAi) to control viral replication. While the siRNA pathway in mosquitoes is heavily studied, less is known about the piRNA pathway. The piRNA pathway in mosquitoes has recently been connected to mosquito antiviral immunity. In Aedes aegypti, Piwi4 has been implicated in antiviral responses. The antiviral role of the piRNA pathway in Culex spp. mosquitoes is understudied compared to Ae. aegypti. Here, we aimed to identify the role of PIWI genes and piRNAs in Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex tarsalis cells during virus infection. We examined the effect of PIWI gene silencing on virus replication of two arboviruses and three insect-specific viruses in Cx. quinquefasciatus derived cells (Hsu) and Cx. tarsalis derived (CT) cells. We show that Piwi4 is antiviral against the La Crosse orthobunyavirus (LACV) in Hsu and CT cells, and the insect-specific rhabdovirus Merida virus (MERDV) in Hsu cells. None of the silenced PIWI genes impacted replication of the two flaviviruses Usutu virus (USUV) and Calbertado virus, or the phasivirus Phasi-Charoen-like virus. We further used small RNA sequencing to determine that LACV-derived piRNAs, but not USUV-derived piRNAs were generated in Hsu cells and that PIWI gene silencing resulted in a small reduction in vpiRNAs. Finally, we determined that LACV-derived DNA was produced in Hsu cells during infection, but whether this viral DNA is required for vpiRNA production remains unclear. Overall, we expanded our knowledge on the piRNA pathway and how it relates to the antiviral response in Culex spp mosquitoes.

TI  - Culex-Transmitted Diseases: Mechanisms, Impact, and Future Control Strategies using Wolbachia
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - Mosquitoes of the Culex genus are responsible for a large burden of zoonotic virus transmission globally. Collectively, they play a significant role in the transmission of medically significant diseases such as Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. Climate change, global trade, habitat transformation and increased urbanisation are leading to the establishment of Culex mosquitoes in new geographical regions. These novel mosquito incursions are intensifying concerns about the emergence of Culex-transmitted diseases and outbreaks in previously unaffected areas. New mosquito control methods are currently being developed and deployed globally. Understanding the complex interaction between pathogens and mosquitoes is essential for developing new control strategies for Culex species mosquitoes. This article reviews the role of Culex mosquitos as vectors of zoonotic disease, discussing the transmission of viruses across different species, and the potential use of Wolbachia technologies to control disease spread. By leveraging the insights gained from recent successful field trials of Wolbachia against Aedes-borne diseases, we comprehensively discuss the feasibility of using this technique to control Culex mosquitoes and the potential for the development of next generational Wolbachia-based control methods.

TI  - Cullin4 Is Pro-Viral during West Nile Virus Infection of Culex Mosquitoes
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - Although mosquitoes serve as vectors of many pathogens of public health importance, their response to viral infection is poorly understood. It also remains to be investigated whether viruses deploy some mechanism to be able to overcome this immune response. Here, we have used an RNA-Seq approach to identify differentially regulated genes in Culex quinquefasciatus cells following West Nile virus (WNV) infection, identifying 265 transcripts from various cellular pathways that were either upregulated or downregulated. Ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway genes, comprising 12% of total differentially regulated genes, were selected for further validation by real time RT-qPCR and functional analysis. It was found that treatment of infected cells with proteasomal inhibitor, MG-132, decreased WNV titers, indicating importance of this pathway during infection process. In infection models, the Culex ortholog of mammalian Cul4A/B (cullin RING ubiquitin ligase) was found to be upregulated in vitro as well as in vivo, especially in midguts of mosquitoes. Gene knockdown using dsRNA and overexpression studies indicated that Culex Cul4 acts as a pro-viral protein by degradation of CxSTAT via ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. We also show that gene knockdown of Culex Cul4 leads to activation of the Jak-STAT pathway in mosquitoes leading to decrease viral replication in the body as well as saliva. Our results suggest a novel mechanism adopted by WNV to overcome mosquito immune response and increase viral replication.

TI  - Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor blocks the production of West Nile virus-induced neuroinflammatory markers in astrocytes
JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 92
SP  - 507
EP  - 515
AB  - Inflammatory immune responses triggered initially to clear West Nile virus (WNV) infection later become detrimental and contribute to the pathological processes such as blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and neuronal death, thus complicating WNV-associated encephalitis (WNVE). It has been demonstrated previously that WNV infection in astrocytes results in induction of multiple matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which mediate BBB disruption. Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and their product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), modulate neuroinflammation and regulate the production of multiple inflammatory molecules including MMPs. Therefore, this study determined and characterized the pathophysiological consequences of the expression of COX enzymes in human brain cortical astrocytes (HBCAs) following WNV infection. Whilst COX-1 mRNA expression did not change, WNV infection significantly induced RNA and protein expression of COX-2 in HBCAs. Similarly, PGE2 production was also enhanced significantly in infected HBCAs and was blocked in the presence of the COX-2-specific inhibitor NS-398, thus suggesting that COX-2, and not COX-1, was the source of the increased PGE2. Treatment of infected HBCAs with NS-398 attenuated the expression of MMP-1, -3 and -9 in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, expression of interleukin-1β, -6 and -8, which were markedly elevated in infected HBCAs, exhibited a significant reduction in their levels in the presence of NS-398. These results provide direct evidence that WNV-induced COX-2/PGE2 is involved in modulating the expression of multiple neuroinflammatory mediators, thereby directly linking COX-2 with WNV disease pathogenesis. The ability of COX-2 inhibitors to modulate WNV-induced COX-2 and PGE2 signalling warrants further investigation in an animal model as a potential approach for clinical management of neuroinflammation associated with WNVE.

TI  - Cyclosporine Inhibits Flavivirus Replication through Blocking the Interaction between Host Cyclophilins and Viral NS5 Protein
JF  - Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy
VL  - 53
SP  - 3226
EP  - 3235
AB  - ABSTRACT Although flaviviruses cause significant human diseases, no effective therapy is currently available. Host factors essential for viral replication are potential targets for antiviral development. Here we report that cyclophilins (CyPs), a family of cellular peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases), play a role in flavivirus replication. Huh-7.5 cells with knockdown of different isoforms of CyP were less efficient than parental cells in supporting flavivirus replication, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus, and yellow fever virus. The low viral replication in CyP A (CyPA) knockdown cells could be rescued by trans supplying of a wild-type CyPA but not by trans supplying of a mutant CyPA (defective in the PPIase activity), indicating that the isomerase activity of CyPA is critical for viral replication. Immunoprecipitation and biochemical pulldown analyses showed that CyPA interacts with WNV genomic RNA and viral NS5 protein in the replication complex. Furthermore, antiviral experiments demonstrated that cyclosporine (Cs; an 11-amino-acid cyclic peptide known to block the PPIase activity of CyPA) inhibits flavivirus replication in cell culture at nontoxic concentrations. Time-of-addition and transient replicon results indicated that Cs inhibits flavivirus at the step of viral RNA synthesis. Biochemical analysis showed that Cs directly blocks the interaction between CyPA and WNV NS5 protein. Our results suggest that host CyPA is a component of flavivirus replication complex and could be targeted for potential antiviral development.

VL  - 6
AB  - Abstract West Nile virus (WNV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus and the leading cause of viral encephalitis in the continental United States. It belongs to the family Flaviviridae which includes other important human pathogens such as dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Zika viruses (ZIKV). Despite several decades of research, no specific antiviral drugs are available to treat flavivirus infections. The present study characterizes the interaction between the WNV NS3 and NS5 proteins for the purpose of identifying hotspots in the protein-protein interaction which could be targeted for the development of antiviral therapeutics. We previously developed an interaction model in silico based on data available in the literature. Here, potential interacting residues on NS3 and NS5 were mutated in a WNV replicon, and seven mutations in the NS3 protein were found to drastically reduce viral replication. In addition to being well conserved among mosquito-borne flaviviruses, these residues are located on the protein’s surface in two clusters which might be interesting new targets for future drug development.

TI  - Deciphering the molecular basis for nucleotide selection by the West Nile virus RNA helicase
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 38
SP  - 5493
EP  - 5506
AB  - The West Nile virus RNA helicase uses the energy derived from the hydrolysis of nucleotides to separate complementary strands of RNA. Although this enzyme has a preference for ATP, the bias towards this purine nucleotide cannot be explained on the basis of specific protein–ATP interactions. Moreover, the enzyme does not harbor the characteristic Q-motif found in other helicases that regulates binding to ATP. In the present study, we used structural homology modeling to generate a model of the West Nile virus RNA helicase active site that provides instructive findings on the interaction between specific amino acids and the ATP substrate. In addition, we evaluated both the phosphohydrolysis and the inhibitory potential of a collection of 30 synthetic purine analogs. A structure-guided alanine scan of 16 different amino acids was also performed to clarify the contacts that are made between the enzyme and ATP. Our study provides a molecular rationale for the bias of the enzyme for ATP by highlighting the specific functional groups on ATP that are important for binding. Moreover, we identified three new essential amino acids (Arg-185, Arg-202 and Asn-417) that are critical for phosphohydrolysis. Finally, we provide evidence that a region located upstream of motif I, which we termed the nucleotide specificity region, plays a functional role in nucleotide selection which is reminiscent to the role exerted by the Q-motif found in other helicases.

TI  - Defective Inflammatory Monocyte Development in IRF8-Deficient Mice Abrogates Migration to the West Nile Virus-Infected Brain
JF  - Journal of Innate Immunity
VL  - 7
SP  - 102
EP  - 112
AB  - IRF8 (interferon-regulatory factor-8) plays a critical role in regulating myeloid cell differentiation. However, the role of this transcription factor in the development of Ly6C+ inflammatory monocytes and their migration to the infected brain has not been examined. We have previously shown that West Nile virus (WNV) infection of wild-type (WT) mice triggers a significant increase in numbers of Ly6C+ monocytes in the bone marrow. These cells traffic via the blood to the infected brain, where they give rise to proinflammatory macrophages. Here, we show that WNV-infected IRF8-deficient (IRF8-/-) mice had significantly reduced numbers of Ly6C+ monocytes in the periphery, with few of these cells found in the blood. Furthermore, low numbers of inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages were observed in the brains of IRF8-/- mice throughout infection. Adoptive transfer of IRF8-/- Ly6C+ monocytes demonstrated that these cells were intrinsically unable to traffic to the inflamed brain. Low expression of the chemokine receptor CCR2 and integrin VLA-4 by IRF8-/- monocytes likely contributed to this defect, as the interactions between these proteins and their ligands are critical for monocyte egress and migration to inflammatory foci. These data highlight a critical role for IRF8 in inflammatory monocyte differentiation and migration during WNV infection.

TI  - Defining the Chemokine Basis for Leukocyte Recruitment during Viral Encephalitis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 9553
EP  - 9567
AB  - ABSTRACT The encephalitic response to viral infection requires local chemokine production and the ensuing recruitment of immune and inflammatory leukocytes. Accordingly, chemokine receptors present themselves as plausible therapeutic targets for drugs aimed at limiting encephalitic responses. However, it remains unclear which chemokines are central to this process and whether leukocyte recruitment is important for limiting viral proliferation and survival in the brain or whether it is predominantly a driver of coincident inflammatory pathogenesis. Here we examine chemokine expression and leukocyte recruitment in the context of avirulent and virulent Semliki Forest virus (SFV) as well as West Nile virus infection and demonstrate rapid and robust expression of a variety of inflammatory CC and CXC chemokines in all models. On this basis, we define a chemokine axis involved in leukocyte recruitment to the encephalitic brain during SFV infection. CXCR3 is the most active; CCR2 is also active but less so, and CCR5 plays only a modest role in leukocyte recruitment. Importantly, inhibition of each of these receptors individually and the resulting suppression of leukocyte recruitment to the infected brain have no effect on viral titer or survival following infection with a virulent SFV strain. In contrast, simultaneous blockade of CXCR3 and CCR2 results in significantly reduced mortality in response to virulent SFV infection. In summary, therefore, our data provide an unprecedented level of insight into chemokine orchestration of leukocyte recruitment in viral encephalitis. Our data also highlight CXCR3 and CCR2 as possible therapeutic targets for limiting inflammatory damage in response to viral infection of the brain. IMPORTANCE Brain inflammation (encephalitis) in response to viral infection can lead to severe illness and even death. This therefore represents an important clinical problem and one that requires the development of new therapeutic approaches. Central to the pathogenesis of encephalitis is the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the infected brain, a process driven by members of the chemokine family. Here we provide an in-depth analysis of the chemokines involved in leukocyte recruitment to the virally infected brain and demonstrate that simultaneous blockade of two of these receptors, namely, CXCR3 and CCR2, does not alter viral titers within the brain but markedly reduces inflammatory leukocyte recruitment and enhances survival in a murine model of lethal viral encephalitis. Our results therefore highlight chemokine receptors as plausible therapeutic targets in treating viral encephalitis.

TI  - Degradation of MicroRNA miR-466d-3p by Japanese Encephalitis Virus NS3 Facilitates Viral Replication and Interleukin-1β Expression
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - Host miRNAs have been reported to regulate JEV-induced inflammation in the CNS. We found that JEV infection could reduce expression of host miRNA. The helicase region of the NS3 protein bound specifically to miRNA precursors and could lead to incorrect unwinding of miRNA precursors, thereby reducing the expression of mature miRNAs. This observation led to two major findings. First, our results suggested that JEV NS3 protein induced miR-466d-3p degradation, which promoted IL-1β expression and JEV replication. Second, arginine molecules on NS3 were the main miRNA-binding sites, because we demonstrated that miRNA degradation was abolished if arginines at R226 and R202 were mutated. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of JEV and reveals several amino acid sites that could be mutated for a JEV vaccine. ABSTRACT Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection alters microRNA (miRNA) expression in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the mechanism contributing to miRNA regulation in the CNS is not known. We discovered global degradation of mature miRNA in mouse brains and neuroblastoma (NA) cells after JEV infection. Integrative analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs suggested that several significantly downregulated miRNAs and their targeted mRNAs were clustered into an inflammation pathway. Transfection with miRNA 466d-3p (miR-466d-3p) decreased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression and inhibited JEV replication in NA cells. However, miR-466d-3p expression increased after JEV infection in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that viral protein expression reduced miR-466d-3p expression. We generated all the JEV coding proteins and demonstrated NS3 helicase protein to be a potent miRNA suppressor. The NS3 proteins of Zika virus, West Nile virus, and dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) and DENV-2 also decreased miR-466d-3p expression. Results from helicase-blocking assays and in vitro unwinding assays demonstrated that NS3 could unwind pre-miR-466d and induce miRNA dysfunction. Computational models and an RNA immunoprecipitation assay revealed arginine-rich domains of NS3 to be crucial for pre-miRNA binding and degradation of host miRNAs. Importantly, site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues in NS3 revealed that R226G and R202W reduced the binding affinity and degradation of pre-miR-466d. These results expand the function of flavivirus helicases beyond unwinding duplex RNA to degrade pre-miRNAs. Hence, we revealed a new mechanism for NS3 in regulating miRNA pathways and promoting neuroinflammation. IMPORTANCE Host miRNAs have been reported to regulate JEV-induced inflammation in the CNS.

TI  - Degradation of miR-466d-3p by JEV NS3 facilitates viral replication and IL-1β expression
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Previous studies revealed that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection alters the expression of miRNA in central nervous system (CNS). However, the mechanism of JEV infection contributes to the regulation of miRNAs in CNS remain obscure. Here, we found that a global degradation of mature miRNA in mouse brain and neuroblastoma cells after JEV infection. In additional, the integrative analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs suggests that those down-regulated miRNAs are primarily targeted inflammation genes and the miR-466d-3p target the IL-1β which in the middle of those inflammation genes. Transfection of miR-466d-3p decreased the IL-1β expression and inhibited the JEV replication in NA cells. Interestingly, the miR-466d-3p level increased after JEV infection in the presence of cycloheximide, which indicated that viral protein expression reduces miR-466d-3p. Therefore, we generated all the JEV coding protein and demonstrated that NS3 is a potent miRNA suppressor. Furthermore, the NS3 of ZIKA virus, WNV, DENV1 and DENV2 also decreased the expression of miR-466d-3p. The in vitro unwinding assay demonstrated that the NS3 could unwind the pre-miR-466d and induce the disfunction of miRNA. Using computational models and RNA immunoprecipitation assay, we found that arginine-rich domains of NS3 are critical for pre-miRNA binding and the degradation of host miRNAs. Importantly, site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues revealed that R226G and R202W significantly reduced the binding affinity and degradation of pre-miR-466d. Together, these results extend the helicase of Flavivirus function beyond unwinding duplex RNA to the decay of pre-miRNAs, which provides a new mechanism of NS3 in regulating miRNA pathways and promoting the neuroinflammation. Author Summary Host miRNAs had been reported to regulate JEV induced inflammation in central nervous system. We found that the NS3 of JEV can reduce most of host miRNA expression. The helicase region of the NS3 specifically binds to precursors of miRNA and lead to incorrect unwinding of precursors of miRNAs which inhibits the function of miRNAs. This observation leads to two major findings. First, we identified the miR-466d-3p targets to the host IL-1β and E protein of JEV, and NS3 degrades the miR-466d-3p to promote the brain inflammation and viral replication. Second, we proved that the arginine on the helicase of NS3 is the main miRNA binding sites, and the miRNA degradation by NS3 was abolished when the R226 and R202 were mutated on the NS3. These findings were also confirmed with NS3 of ZIKA virus, WNV and DENV which could decrease the expression level of miR-466d-3p to enhance the inflammation. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of encephalitis caused by JEV, and reveals several amino acid sites to further attenuate the JEV vaccine.

EP  - 9
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are important causes of human encephalitis cases, which result in a high mortality ratio and neurological sequelae after recovery. Understanding the mechanism of neuropathogenicity in these viral infections is important for the development of specific antiviral therapy. Here, we focused on human-derived neuronal and glial cells to understand the cellular responses against WNV and JEV infection. It was demonstrated that early IFN-β induction regulated virus replication in glioblastoma tbl98G cells, whereas delayed IFN-β induction resulted in efficient virus replication in neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Moreover, the concealing of viral dsRNA in the intracellular membrane resulted in the delayed IFN response in SK-N-SH cells. These results, which showed different IFN responses between human neuronal and glial cells after WNV or JEV infection, are expected to contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms for neuropathology in these viral infections.

TI  - Delineating the Role of Aedes aegypti ABC Transporter Gene Family during Mosquito Development and Arboviral Infection via Transcriptome Analyses
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 10
AB  - Aedes aegypti acts as a vector for several arboviral diseases that impose a major socio-economic burden. Moreover, the absence of a vaccine against these diseases and drug resistance in mosquitoes necessitates the development of new control strategies for vector-borne diseases. ABC transporters that play a vital role in immunity and other cellular processes in different organisms may act as non-canonical immune molecules against arboviruses, however, their role in mosquito immunity remains unexplored. This study comprehensively analyzed various genetic features of putative ABC transporters and classified them into A-H subfamilies based on their evolutionary relationships. Existing RNA-sequencing data analysis indicated higher expression of cytosolic ABC transporter genes (E & F Subfamily) throughout the mosquito development, while members of other subfamilies exhibited tissue and time-specific expression. Furthermore, comparative gene expression analysis from the microarray dataset of mosquito infected with dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses revealed 31 commonly expressed ABC transporters suggesting a potentially conserved transcriptomic signature of arboviral infection. Among these, only a few transporters of ABCA, ABCC and ABCF subfamily were upregulated, while most were downregulated. This indicates the possible involvement of ABC transporters in mosquito immunity.

TI  - Dendritic cell-associated MAVS is required to control West Nile virus replication and ensuing humoral immune responses
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 14
AB  - Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) is a critical innate immune signaling protein that directs the actions of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway of RNA virus recognition and initiation of anti-viral immunity against West Nile virus (WNV). In the absence of MAVS, mice die more rapidly after infection with the pathogenic WNV-Texas (TX) strain, but also produce elevated WNV-specific IgG concomitant with increased viral burden. Here we investigated whether there was a B cell intrinsic role for MAVS during the development of protective humoral immunity following WNV infection. MAVS-/- mice survived infection from the non-pathogenic WNV-Madagascar (MAD) strain, with limited signs of disease. Compared to wildtype (WT) controls, WNV-MAD-infected MAVS-/- mice had elevated serum neutralizing antibodies, splenic germinal center B cells, plasma cells and effector T cells. We found that when rechallenged with the normally lethal WNV-TX, MAVS-/- mice previously infected with WNV-MAD were protected from disease. Thus, protective humoral and cellular immune responses can be generated in absence of MAVS. Mice with a conditional deletion of MAVS only in CD11c+ dendritic cells phenocopied MAVS whole body knockout mice in their humoral responses to WNV-MAD, displaying elevated virus titers and neutralizing antibodies. Conversely, a B cell-specific deletion of MAVS had no effect on immune responses to WNV-MAD compared to WT controls. Thus, MAVS in dendritic cells is required to control WNV replication and thereby regulate downstream humoral immune responses.

TI  - Dengue Virus NS Proteins Inhibit RIG-I/MAVS Signaling by Blocking TBK1/IRF3 Phosphorylation: Dengue Virus Serotype 1 NS4A Is a Unique Interferon-Regulating Virulence Determinant
JF  - mBio
VL  - 6
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) replication is inhibited by the prior addition of type I interferon or by RIG-I agonists that elicit RIG-I/MAVS/TBK1/IRF3-dependent protective responses. DENV infection of primary human endothelial cells (ECs) results in a rapid increase in viral titer, which suggests that DENV inhibits replication-restrictive RIG-I/interferon beta (IFN-β) induction pathways within ECs. Our findings demonstrate that DENV serotype 4 (DENV4) nonstructural (NS) proteins NS2A and NS4B inhibited RIG-I-, MDA5-, MAVS-, and TBK1/IKKε-directed IFN-β transcription (>80%) but failed to inhibit IFN-β induction directed by STING or constitutively active IRF3-5D. Expression of NS2A and NS4B dose dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3, which suggests that they function at the level of TBK1 complex activation. NS2A and NS4B from DENV1/2/4, as well as the West Nile virus NS4B protein, commonly inhibited TBK1 phosphorylation and IFN-β induction. A comparative analysis of NS4A proteins across DENVs demonstrated that DENV1, but not DENV2 or DENV4, NS4A proteins uniquely inhibited TBK1. These findings indicate that DENVs contain conserved (NS2A/NS4B) and DENV1-specific (NS4A) mechanisms for inhibiting RIG-I/TBK1-directed IFN responses. Collectively, our results define DENV NS proteins that restrict IRF3 and IFN responses and thereby facilitate DENV replication and virulence. Unique DENV1-specific NS4A regulation of IFN induction has the potential to be a virulence determinant that contributes to the increased severity of DENV1 infections and the immunodominance of DENV1 responses during tetravalent DENV1-4 vaccination. IMPORTANCE Our findings demonstrate that NS2A and NS4B proteins from dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, and 4 are inhibitors of RIG-I/MDA5-directed interferon beta (IFN-β) induction and that they accomplish this by blocking TBK1 activation. We determined that IFN inhibition is functionally conserved across NS4B proteins from West Nile virus and DENV1, -2, and -4 viruses. In contrast, DENV1 uniquely encodes an extra IFN regulating protein, NS4A, that inhibits TBK1-directed IFN induction. DENV1 is associated with an increase in severe patient disease, and added IFN regulation by the DENV1 NS4A protein may contribute to increased DENV1 replication, immunodominance, and virulence. The regulation of IFN induction by nonstructural (NS) proteins suggests their potential roles in enhancing viral replication and spread and as potential protein targets for viral attenuation. DENV1-specific IFN regulation needs to be considered in vaccine strategies where enhanced DENV1 replication may interfere with DENV2-4 seroconversion within coadministered tetravalent DENV1-4 vaccines.

JF  - Autophagy
VL  - 13
SP  - 322
EP  - 332
AB  - ABSTRACT The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is exploited by several diverse viruses during their infectious life cycles. Flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), utilize the ER as a source of membranes to establish their replication organelles and to facilitate their assembly and eventual maturation along the secretory pathway. To maintain normal homeostasis, host cells have evolved highly efficient processes to dynamically regulate the ER, such as through reticulophagy, a selective form of autophagy that leads to ER degradation. Here, we identify the ER-localized reticulophagy receptor FAM134B as a host cell restriction factor for both DENV and ZIKV. We show that RNAi-mediated depletion of FAM134B significantly enhances both DENV and ZIKV replication at an early stage of the viral life cycle. Consistent with its role as an antiviral host factor, we found that several flaviviruses including DENV, ZIKV, and West Nile virus (WNV), utilize their NS3 virally-encoded proteases to directly cleave FAM134B at a single site within its reticulon homology domain (RHD). Mechanistically, we show that NS3-mediated cleavage of FAM134B blocks the formation of ER and viral protein-enriched autophagosomes, suggesting that the cleavage of FAM134B serves to specifically suppress the reticulophagy pathway. These findings thus point to an important role for FAM134B and reticulophagy in the regulation of flavivirus infection and suggest that these viruses specifically target these pathways to promote viral replication.

EP  - 93
AB  - The induction of apoptotic cell death is a prominent cytopathic effect of dengue (DEN) viruses. One of the key questions to be addressed is which viral components induce apoptosis in DEN virus-infected cells. This study investigated whether the small membrane (M) protein was involved in the induction of apoptosis by DEN virus. This was addressed by using a series of enhanced green fluorescent protein-fused DEN proteins. Evidence is provided that intracellular production of the M ectodomains (residues M-1 to M-40) of all four DEN serotypes triggered apoptosis in host cells such as mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2a and human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The M ectodomains of the wild-type strains of Japanese encephalitis, West Nile and yellow fever viruses also had proapoptotic properties. The export of the M ectodomain from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane appeared to be essential for the initiation of apoptosis. The study found that anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 protected HepG2 cells against the death-promoting activity of the DEN M ectodomain. This suggests that the M ectodomain exerts its cytotoxic effects by activating a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The cytotoxicity of the DEN M ectodomain reflected the intrinsic proapoptotic properties of the nine carboxy-terminal amino acids (residues M-32 to M-40) designated ApoptoM: Residue M-36 was unique in that it modulated the death-promoting activity of the M ectodomain. Defining the ApoptoM-activated signalling pathways leading to apoptosis will provide the basis for studying how the M protein might play a key role in the fate of the flavivirus-infected cells.

JF  - Pharmaceutics
VL  - 14
AB  - Dengue, West Nile and Zika viruses are vector-borne flaviviruses responsible for numerous disease outbreaks in both Hemispheres. Despite relatively low mortality, infection may lead to potentially severe situations such as (depending on the virus): hypovolemic shock, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, congenital malformations (e.g., microcephaly) and, in some situations, death. Moreover, outbreaks also have major socioeconomic repercussions, especially in already vulnerable societies. Thus far, only generic symptoms relief is possible, as there are no specific treatments available yet. Dengvaxia was the world’s first dengue vaccine. However, it is not fully effective. Prophylactic approaches against West Nile and Zika viruses are even more limited. Therefore, therapeutic strategies are required and will be discussed hereafter. We will first briefly present these viruses’ epidemiology, life cycle and structure. Then, we introduce the clinical presentation, diagnosis approaches and available vaccines. Finally, we list and discuss promising compounds at discovery and preclinical development stages already deposited at the GlobalData database and divided into three main types, according to therapeutic molecule: antibody-based, peptide-based molecules and, other compounds. To conclude, we discuss and compare promising developments, useful for future therapies against these three flaviviruses of major concern to human health.

JF  - Biological Chemistry
VL  - 391

EP  - 559
AB  - Abstract Flaviviral NS2B/NS3 heterocomplex serine proteases are a primary target for anti-flavivirus drug discovery. To gain insights into the enzymatic properties and molecular determinants of flaviviral NS2B/NS3 protease substrate specificity in host cells, we developed and applied a novel series of membrane-anchored red-shifted fluorescent protein substrates to detect West Nile virus (WNV) NS2B/NS3 endoproteolytic activity in human cells. The substrate consists of a fluorescent reporter group (DsRed) tethered to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by a membrane-anchoring domain. Between the two domains is a specific peptide linker that corresponds to the NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, NS3/NS4A, and NS4B/NS5 protein junctions within the WNV polyprotein precursor. When the protease cleaves the peptide linker, the DsRed reporter group is released, changing its localization in the cell from membrane-bound punctate perinuclear to diffuse cytoplasmic. This change in protein location can be monitored by fluorescent microscopy, and cleavage products can be quantified by Western blotting. Our data demonstrate the robustness of our trans-cleavage fluorescence assay to capture single-cell imaging of membrane-associated WNV NS2B/NS3 endoproteolytic activity and to perform in-cell selectivity profiling of the NS2B/NS3 protease. Our study is the first to provide cellular insights into the biological and enzymatic properties of a prime target for inhibitors of WNV replication.

TI  - Differential Effects of Mutations in NS4B on West Nile Virus Replication and Inhibition of Interferon Signaling
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 11809
EP  - 11816
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a human pathogen that can cause symptomatic infections associated with meningitis and encephalitis. Previously, we demonstrated that replication of WNV inhibits the interferon (IFN) signal transduction pathway by preventing the accumulation of phosphorylated Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) (J. T. Guo et al., J. Virol. 79:1343-1350, 2005). Through a genetic analysis, we have now identified a determinant on the nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) that controls IFN resistance in HeLa cells expressing subgenomic WNV replicons lacking the structural genes. However, in the context of infectious genomes, the same determinant did not influence IFN signaling. Thus, our results indicate that NS4B may be sufficient to inhibit the IFN response in replicon cells and suggest a role for structural genes, or as yet unknown interactions, in the inhibition of the IFN signaling pathway during WNV infections.

JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 95
SP  - 862
EP  - 867
AB  - The neuroinflammatory response to West Nile virus (WNV) infection can be either protective or pathological depending on the context. Although several studies have examined chemokine profiles within brains of WNV-infected mice, little is known about how various cell types within the central nervous system (CNS) contribute to chemokine expression. Here, we assessed chemokine expression in brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes, which comprise the major components of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), in response to a non-pathogenic (WNV-MAD78) and a highly pathogenic (WNV-NY) strain of WNV. Higher levels of the chemokine CCL5 were detected in WNV-MAD78-infected brain endothelial monolayers compared with WNV-NY-infected cells. However, the opposite profile was observed in WNV-infected astrocytes, indicating that pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of WNV provoke different CCL5 profiles at the BBB. Thus, cells comprising the BBB may contribute to a dynamic pro-inflammatory response within the CNS that evolves as WNV infection progresses.

TI  - Dimerization of Flavivirus NS4B Protein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 3379
EP  - 3391
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus replication is mediated by a complex machinery that consists of viral enzymes, nonenzymatic viral proteins, and host factors. Many of the nonenzymatic viral proteins, such as NS4B, are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. How these membrane proteins function in viral replication is poorly understood. Here we report a robust method to express and purify dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus NS4B proteins. The NS4B proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, reconstituted in dodecyl maltoside (DDM) detergent micelles, and purified to >95% homogeneity. The recombinant NS4B proteins dimerized in vitro, as evidenced by gel filtration, chemical cross-linking, and multiangle light scattering experiments. The dimeric form of NS4B was also detected when the protein was expressed alone in cells as well as in cells infected with DENV type 2 (DENV-2). Mutagenesis analysis showed that the cytosolic loop (amino acids 129 to 165) and the C-terminal region (amino acids 166 to 248) are responsible for NS4B dimerization. trans-Complementation experiments showed that (i) two genome-length RNAs containing distinct NS4B lethal mutations could not trans-complement each other, (ii) the replication defect of NS4B mutant RNA could be restored in cells containing DENV-2 replicons, and (iii) expression of wild-type NS4B protein alone was not sufficient to restore the replication of the NS4B mutant RNA. Collectively, the results indicate that trans-complementation of a lethal NS4B mutant RNA requires wild-type NS4B presented from a replication complex. IMPORTANCE The reported expression and purification system has made it possible to study the biochemistry and structure of flavivirus NS4B proteins. The finding of flavivirus NS4B dimerization and the mapping of regions important for NS4B dimerization provide the possibility to inhibit viral replication through blocking NS4B dimerization. The requirement of NS4B in the context of the replication complex for successful trans-complementation enhances our understanding of NS4B in flavivirus replication.

TI  - Direct Activation of Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) by PF-06409577 Inhibits Flavivirus Infection through Modification of Host Cell Lipid Metabolism
JF  - Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy
VL  - 62
AB  - ABSTRACT Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are a group of RNA viruses that constitute global threats for human and animal health. Replication of these pathogens is strictly dependent on cellular lipid metabolism. We have evaluated the effect of the pharmacological activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of lipid metabolism, on the infection of three medically relevant flaviviruses, namely, West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and dengue virus (DENV). WNV is responsible for recurrent outbreaks of meningitis and encephalitis, affecting humans and horses worldwide. ZIKV has caused a recent pandemic associated with birth defects (microcephaly), reproductive disorders, and severe neurological complications (Guillain-Barré syndrome). DENV is the etiological agent of the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease, which can induce a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue. Our results showed, for the first time, that activation of AMPK using the specific small molecule activator PF-06409577 reduced WNV, ZIKV, and DENV infection. This antiviral effect was associated with an impairment of viral replication due to the modulation of host cell lipid metabolism exerted by the compound. These results support that the pharmacological activation of AMPK, which currently constitutes an important pharmacological target for human diseases, could also provide a feasible approach for broad-spectrum host-directed antiviral discovery.

JF  - Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology
VL  - 68
SP  - 1061
EP  - 1072
AB  - Neuroinvasive West Nile virus (WNV) infections may cause acute flaccid paralysis (AFP); in fatal cases, anterior horn cell loss is presumed to be caused by direct viral infection. In related animal models, however, glutamate excitotoxicity mediates bystander injury of uninfected anterior horn cells, suggesting additional pathogenic mechanisms. We examined expression of the principal excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) of astrocytes (i.e. EAAT-2 in humans, glutamate transporter 1 in hamsters) in the spinal cord of human WNV-induced AFP patients and in hamsters with WNV-induced AFP by immunohistochemistry. Glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptic and dendritic markers (i.e. synaptophysin, microtubule-associated protein 2), immune activation (HLA-DR), and viral antigens were also evaluated. Humans and hamsters with WNV-induced AFP had decreased spinal gray matter EAAT expression despite greater numbers of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes compared with controls. Areas of diminished EAAT expression showed reduced synaptic and dendritic protein expression and prominent local inflammation but few infected neurons. These findings suggest that WNV infection results in local immune activation within the spinal cord that in turn causes a failure of astrocyte glutamate reuptake even as the number of astrocytes increases; rising extracellular glutamate levels may then drive excitotoxic injury of both infected and uninfected anterior horn cells. The pathogenesis of this increasingly common disorder likely involves immune response and excitotoxicity mechanisms that are potential therapeutic targets.

TI  - Distinct RNA Elements Confer Specificity to Flavivirus RNA Cap Methylation Events
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 4412
EP  - 4421
AB  - ABSTRACT The 5′ end of the flavivirus plus-sense RNA genome contains a type 1 cap (m7GpppAmG), followed by a conserved stem-loop structure. We report that nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) from four serocomplexes of flaviviruses specifically methylates the cap through recognition of the 5′ terminus of viral RNA. Distinct RNA elements are required for the methylations at guanine N-7 on the cap and ribose 2′-OH on the first transcribed nucleotide. In a West Nile virus (WNV) model, N-7 cap methylation requires specific nucleotides at the second and third positions and a 5′ stem-loop structure; in contrast, 2′-OH ribose methylation requires specific nucleotides at the first and second positions, with a minimum 5′ viral RNA of 20 nucleotides. The cap analogues GpppA and m7GpppA are not active substrates for WNV methytransferase. Footprinting experiments using Gppp- and m7Gppp-terminated RNAs suggest that the 5′ termini of RNA substrates interact with NS5 during the sequential methylation reactions. Cap methylations could be inhibited by an antisense oligomer targeting the first 20 nucleotides of WNV genome. The viral RNA-specific cap methylation suggests methyltransferase as a novel target for flavivirus drug discovery.

TI  - Drak2 Contributes to West Nile Virus Entry into the Brain and Lethal Encephalitis1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 181
SP  - 2084
EP  - 2091
AB  - Death-associated protein kinase-related apoptosis-inducing kinase-2 (Drak2), a member of the death-associated protein family of serine/threonine kinases, is specifically expressed in T and B cells. In the absence of Drak2, mice are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis due to a decrease in the number of cells infiltrating the CNS. In the present study, we investigated the role of Drak2 in West Nile virus (WNV)-induced encephalitis and found that Drak2−/− mice were also more resistant to lethal WNV infection than wild-type mice. Although Drak2−/− mice had an increase in the number of IFN-γ-producing T cells in the spleen after infection, viral levels in the peripheral tissues were not significantly different between these two groups of mice. In contrast, there was a reduced viral load in the brains of Drak2−/− mice, which was accompanied by a decrease in the number of Drak2−/− CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the brain following WNV infection. Moreover, we detected viral Ags in T cells isolated from the spleen or brain of WNV-infected mice. These results suggest that following a systemic infection, WNV might cross the blood brain barrier and enter the CNS by being carried by infected infiltrating T cells.

TI  - Dual roles for the ER membrane protein complex in flavivirus infection: viral entry and protein biogenesis
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 9
AB  - Hundreds of cellular host factors are required to support dengue virus infection, but their identity and roles are incompletely characterized. Here, we identify human host dependency factors required for efficient dengue virus-2 (DENV2) infection of human cells. We focused on two, TTC35 and TMEM111, which we previously demonstrated to be required for yellow fever virus (YFV) infection and others subsequently showed were also required by other flaviviruses. These proteins are components of the human endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC), which has roles in ER-associated protein biogenesis and lipid metabolism. We report that DENV, YFV and Zika virus (ZIKV) infections were strikingly inhibited, while West Nile virus infection was unchanged, in cells that lack EMC subunit 4. Furthermore, targeted depletion of EMC subunits in live mosquitoes significantly reduced DENV2 propagation in vivo. Using a novel uncoating assay, which measures interactions between host RNA-binding proteins and incoming viral RNA, we show that EMC is required at or prior to virus uncoating. Importantly, we uncovered a second and important role for the EMC. The complex is required for viral protein accumulation in a cell line harboring a ZIKV replicon, indicating that EMC participates in the complex process of viral protein biogenesis.

TI  - Dynamic Interactions of Post Cleaved NS2B Cofactor and NS3 Protease Identified by Integrative Structural Approaches
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Diseases caused by flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile Virus (WNV), are a serious threat to public health. The flavivirus single-stranded RNA genome is translated into a polyprotein which is cleaved into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins by the viral and cellular proteases. Non-structural (NS) protein 3 is a multifunctional protein that has N-terminal protease and C-terminal helicase domains. The NS3 protease requires co-factor NS2B for enzymatic activity and folding. Due to its essential role in viral replication, NS2B-NS3 protease is an attractive target for antiviral drugs. Despite the availability of crystal structures, dynamic interactions of the N- and C-termini of NS2B co-factor have been elusive due to their flexible fold. In this study, we employ integrative structural approaches combined with biochemical assays to elucidate the dynamic interactions of the flexible DENV4 NS2B and NS3 N- and C-termini. We captured the crystal structure of self-cleaved DENV4 NS2B47NS3 protease in post cleavage state. The intermediate conformation adopted in the reported structure can be targeted by allosteric inhibitors. Comparison of our new findings from DENV4 against previously studied ZIKV NS2B-NS3 proteins reveals differences in NS2B-NS3 function between the two viruses. No inhibition of protease activity was observed for unlinked DENV NS2B-NS3 in presence of the cleavage site while ZIKV NS2B-NS3 cleavage inhibits protease activity. Another difference is that binding of the NS2B C-terminus to DENV4 eNS2B47NS3Pro active site is mediated via interactions with P4-P6 residues while for ZIKV, the binding of NS2B C-terminus to active site is mediated by P1-P3 residues. The mapping of NS2B N- and C-termini with NS3 indicates that these intermolecular interactions occur mainly on the beta-barrel 2 of the NS3 protease domain. Our integrative approach enables a comprehensive understanding of the folding and dynamic interactions of DENV NS3 protease and its cofactor NS2B.

TI  - Dynamics of Tissue-Specific CD8+ T Cell Responses during West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 92
AB  - ABSTRACT The mouse model of West Nile virus (WNV), which is a leading cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis worldwide, has provided fundamental insights into the host and viral factors that regulate viral pathogenesis and infection outcome. In particular, CD8+ T cells are critical for controlling WNV replication and promoting protection against infection. Here, we present the characterization of a T cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic mouse with specificity for the immunodominant epitope in the WNV NS4B protein (here referred to as transgenic WNV-I mice). Using an adoptive-transfer model, we found that WNV-I CD8+ T cells behave similarly to endogenous CD8+ T cell responses, with an expansion phase in the periphery beginning around day 7 postinfection (p.i.) followed by a contraction phase through day 15 p.i. Through the use of in vivo intravascular immune cell staining, we determined the kinetics, expansion, and differentiation into effector and memory subsets of WNV-I CD8+ T cells within the spleen and brain. We found that red-pulp WNV-I CD8+ T cells were more effector-like than white-pulp WNV-I CD8+ T cells, which displayed increased differentiation into memory precursor cells. Within the central nervous system (CNS), we found that WNV-I CD8+ T cells were polyfunctional (gamma interferon [IFN-γ] and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]), displayed tissue-resident characteristics (CD69+ and CD103+), persisted in the brain through day 15 p.i., and reduced the viral burden within the brain. The use of these TCR-transgenic WNV-I mice provides a new resource to dissect the immunological mechanisms of CD8+ T cell-mediated protection during WNV infection. IMPORTANCE West Nile Virus (WNV) is the leading cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis worldwide. There are currently no approved therapeutics or vaccines for use in humans to treat or prevent WNV infection. CD8+ T cells are critical for controlling WNV replication and protecting against infection. Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of a novel TCR-transgenic mouse with specificity for the immunodominant epitope in the WNV NS4B protein. In this study, we determine the kinetics, proliferation, differentiation into effector and memory subsets, homing, and clearance of WNV in the CNS. Our findings provide a new resource to dissect the immunological mechanisms of CD8+ T cell-mediated protection during WNV infection.

TI  - Dysregulation of TLR3 Impairs the Innate Immune Response to West Nile Virus in the Elderly
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 7613
EP  - 7623
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has recently emerged in North America, and the elderly are particularly susceptible to severe neurological disease and death from infection with this virus. We have investigated the innate immune response of primary human macrophages to WNV in vitro and have found significant differences between the responsiveness of macrophages derived from younger donors and that from older donors. Binding of the glycosylated WNV envelope protein to the C-type lectin dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM3) grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) leads to a reduction in the expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in macrophages from young donors via the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-mediated pathway. This signaling is impaired in the elderly, and the elevated levels of TLR3 result in an elevation of cytokine levels. This alteration of the innate immune response with aging may contribute to the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and suggests a possible mechanism for the increased severity of WNV infection in older individuals.

TI  - Dysregulation of Toll-Like Receptor 7 Compromises Innate and Adaptive T Cell Responses and Host Resistance to an Attenuated West Nile Virus Infection in Old Mice
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 1333
EP  - 1344
AB  - ABSTRACT The elderly are known to have enhanced susceptibility to infections and an impaired capacity to respond to vaccination. West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has induced severe neurological symptoms, mostly in the elderly population. No vaccines are available for human use. Recent work showed that an attenuated WNV, a nonstructural (NS) 4B-P38G mutant, induced no lethality but strong immune responses in young (6- to 10-week-old) mice. While studying protective efficacy, we found unexpectedly that old (21- to 22-month) mice were susceptible to WNV NS4B-P38G mutant infection but were protected from subsequent lethal wild-type WNV challenge. Compared to responses in young mice, the NS4B-P38G mutant triggered higher inflammatory cytokine and interleukin-10 (IL-10) production, a delayed γδ T cell expansion, and lower antibody and WNV-specific T cell responses in old mice. Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is expressed on multiple types of cells. Impaired TLR7 signaling in old mice led to dendritic cell (DC) antigen-presenting function compromise and a reduced γδ T cell and regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion during NS4B-P38G mutant infection. R848, a TLR7 agonist, decreased host vulnerability in NS4B-P38G-infected old mice by enhancing γδ T cell and Treg expansion and the antigen-presenting capacity of DCs, thereby promoting T cell responses. In summary, our results suggest that dysregulation of TLR7 partially contributes to impaired innate and adaptive T cell responses and an enhanced vulnerability in old mice during WNV NS4B-P38G mutant infection. R848 increases the safety and efficacy during immunization of old mice with the WNV NS4B-P38G mutant. IMPORTANCE The elderly are known to have enhanced susceptibility to infections and an impaired capacity to respond to vaccination. West Nile virus (WNV), an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, has induced severe neurological symptoms more frequently in the elderly population. No vaccines are available for human use. Here, we used an aged mouse model to investigate the protective efficacy of an attenuated WNV, the nonstructural 4B-P38G mutant, which was previously shown to induce no lethality but strong immune responses in young adult mice. Studies that contribute to a mechanistic understanding of immune defects in the elderly will allow the development of strategies to improve responses to infectious diseases and to increase vaccine efficacy and safety in aging individuals.

TI  - Early B-Cell Activation after West Nile Virus Infection Requires Alpha/Beta Interferon but Not Antigen Receptor Signaling
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 10964
EP  - 10974
AB  - ABSTRACT The B-cell response against West Nile virus (WNV), an encephalitic Flavivirus of global concern, is critical to controlling central nervous system dissemination and neurological sequelae, including death. Here, using a well-characterized mouse model of WNV infection, we examine the factors that govern early B-cell activation. Subcutaneous inoculation with a low dose of replicating WNV results in extensive B-cell activation in the draining lymph node (LN) within days of infection as judged by upregulation of the surface markers CD69, class II major histocompatibility complex, and CD86 on CD19+ cells. B-cell activation in the LN but not the spleen was dependent on signals through the type I alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) receptor. Despite significant activation in the draining LN at day 3 after infection, WNV-specific B cells were not detected by immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunospot analysis until day 7. Liposome depletion experiments demonstrate that B-cell activation after WNV infection was not affected by the loss of F4/80+ or CD169+ subcapsular macrophages. Nonetheless, LN myeloid cells were essential for control of viral replication and survival from infection. Overall, our data suggest that the massive, early polyclonal B-cell activation occurring in the draining LN after WNV infection is immunoglobulin receptor and macrophage independent but requires sustained signals through the type I IFN-α/β receptor.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81

EP  - 9108
AB  - ABSTRACT Infection of cells with flaviviruses in vitro is reduced by pretreatment with small amounts of type I interferon (IFN-α/β). Similarly, pretreatment of animals with IFN and experiments using mice defective in IFN signaling have indicated a role for IFN in controlling flavivirus disease in vivo. These data, along with findings that flavivirus-infected cells block IFN signaling, suggest that flavivirus infection can trigger an IFN response. To investigate IFN gene induction by the very first cells infected during in vivo infection with the flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV), we infected mice with high-titer preparations of WNV virus-like particles (VLPs), which initiate viral genome replication in cells but fail to spread. These studies demonstrated a brisk production of IFN in vivo, with peak levels of over 1,000 units/ml detected in sera between 8 and 24 h after inoculation by either the intraperitoneal or footpad route. The IFN response was dependent on genome replication, and WNV genomes and WNV antigen-positive cells were readily detected in the popliteal lymph nodes (pLN) of VLP-inoculated mice. High levels of IFN mRNA transcripts and functional IFN were also produced in VLP-inoculated IFN regulatory factor 3 null (IRF3−/−) mice, indicating that IFN production was independent of the IRF3 pathways to IFN gene transcription, consistent with the IFN type produced (predominantly α).

TI  - Early induction of interferon-independent virus-specific ICAM-1 (CD54) expression by flavivirus in quiescent but not proliferating fibroblasts--implications for virus-host interactions.
JF  - Virology
VL  - 208 2
SP  - 437
EP  - 49
AB  - West Nile Virus (WNV) infection of human embryonic fibroblasts can induce expression of ICAM-1 by two distinct mechanisms. An early and direct mechanism occurs within 2 hr of virus infection which is cytokine independent, and an indirect mechanism occurs within 24 hr of virus infection and is regulated by the release of IFN-type 1. Virus-inactivated, conditioned supernatants removed from WNV-infected fibroblast cultures at 4 hr did not alter ICAM-1 expression on fresh, untreated fibroblasts, whereas conditioned supernatants from 24-hr-infected cultures induced small increases in ICAM-1 expression after incubation for 24 hr but not after 4 hr. These studies also demonstrate that the expression of ICAM-1 on fibroblasts in response to flavivirus is cell-cycle dependent. WNV can only induce increased ICAM-1 expression in quiescent fibroblasts in G0 phase. In contrast, induction of ICAM-1 after exposure to types 1 and 2 IFN is not cell-cycle dependent. Other viruses, including double-stranded DNA viruses, vaccinia, and adenovirus 2 and 5 and the single, positive-stranded RNA alphavirus, Semiliki Forest virus, did not induce ICAM-1 expression on fibroblasts after 24 hr. Another alphavirus, Ross river, was able to induce ICAM-1 but only by the indirect mechanism of type 1 IFN-dependent release. The closely related flavivirus, Kunjin, induced increased ICAM-1 expression in a manner similar to WNV. The ability of flaviviruses to induce increased ICAM-1 expression directly within a few hours of infection may be an important virus-host survival strategy promoting cell-cell adhesion and hence possible further viral infection/replication.

TI  - Effect of Wolbachia on Replication of West Nile Virus in a Mosquito Cell Line and Adult Mosquitoes
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 851
EP  - 858
AB  - ABSTRACT Wolbachia as an endosymbiont is widespread in insects and other arthropods and is best known for reproductive manipulations of the host. Recently, it has been shown that wMelpop and wMel strains of Wolbachia inhibit the replication of several RNA viruses, including dengue virus, and other vector-borne pathogens (e.g., Plasmodium and filarial nematodes) in mosquitoes, providing an alternative approach to limit the transmission of vector-borne pathogens. In this study, we tested the effect of Wolbachia on the replication of West Nile Virus (WNV). Surprisingly, accumulation of the genomic RNA of WNV for all three strains of WNV tested (New York 99, Kunjin, and New South Wales) was enhanced in Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti cells (Aag2). However, the amount of secreted virus was significantly reduced in the presence of Wolbachia. Intrathoracic injections showed that replication of WNV in A. aegypti mosquitoes infected with wMel strain of Wolbachia was not inhibited, whereas wMelPop strain of Wolbachia significantly reduced the replication of WNV in mosquitoes. Further, when wMelPop mosquitoes were orally fed with WNV, virus infection, transmission, and dissemination rates were very low in Wolbachia-free mosquitoes and were completely inhibited in the presence of Wolbachia. The results suggest that (i) despite the enhancement of viral genomic RNA replication in the Wolbachia-infected cell line the production of secreted virus was significantly inhibited, (ii) the antiviral effect in intrathoracically infected mosquitoes depends on the strain of Wolbachia, and (iii) replication of the virus in orally fed mosquitoes was completely inhibited in wMelPop strain of Wolbachia.

JF  - Journal of Enzyme Inhibition and Medicinal Chemistry
VL  - 32
SP  - 712
EP  - 721
AB  - Abstract West Nile virus (WNV) and Dengue virus (DENV) replication depends on the viral NS2B-NS3 protease and the host enzyme furin, which emerged as potential drug targets. Modification of our previously described WNV protease inhibitors by basic phenylalanine analogs provided compounds with reduced potency against the WNV and DENV protease. In a second series, their decarboxylated P1-trans-(4-guanidino)cyclohexylamide was replaced by an arginyl-amide moiety. Compound 4-(guanidinomethyl)-phenylacetyl-Lys-Lys-Arg-NH2 inhibits the NS2B-NS3 protease of WNV with an inhibition constant of 0.11 µM. Due to the similarity in substrate specificity, we have also tested the potency of our previously described multibasic furin inhibitors. Their further modification provided chimeric inhibitors with additional potency against the WNV and DENV proteases. A strong inhibition of WNV and DENV replication in cell culture was observed for the specific furin inhibitors, which reduced virus titers up to 10,000-fold. These studies reveal that potent inhibitors of furin can block the replication of DENV and WNV.

TI  - Effects of Organic Amendments on Microbiota Associated with the Culex nigripalpus Mosquito Vector of the Saint Louis Encephalitis and West Nile Viruses
JF  - mSphere
VL  - 2
AB  - Mosquito microbiota provide important physiological and ecological attributes to mosquitoes, including an impact on their susceptibility to pathogens, fitness, and sensitivity to mosquito control agents. Culex nigripalpus mosquito populations transmit various pathogens, including the Saint Louis and West Nile viruses, and proliferate in nutrient-rich environments, such as in wastewater treatment wetlands. Our study examined whether increases in nutrients within larval mosquito developmental habitats impact microbial communities associated with C. nigripalpus mosquitoes. We characterized the effects of organic enrichments on microbiomes associated with C. nigripalpus mosquitoes and identified potential bacterial microbiota that will be further investigated for whether they alter mosquito life history traits and for their potential role in the development of microbial-based control strategies. ABSTRACT Pollution from nutrients in aquatic habitats has been linked to increases in disease vectors, including mosquitoes and other pestiferous insects. One possibility is that changes in mosquito microbiomes are impacted by nutrient enrichments and that these changes affect various traits, including larval development, susceptibility to larval control agents, and susceptibility of the adult mosquitoes to pathogens. We tested this hypothesis using field mesocosms supplemented with low- and high-organic-nutrient regimens and then sampled microbial communities associated with the naturally colonizing Culex nigripalpus mosquito vector. By high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene sequences, we found no significant differences in overall microbial communities associated with sampled mosquitoes, despite detecting discernible differences in environmental variables, including pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient amendments. Nevertheless, indicator species analysis revealed that members of the Clostridiales were significantly associated with mosquitoes that originated from high-nutrient enrichments. In contrast, members of the Burkholderiales were associated with mosquitoes from the low-nutrient enrichment. High bacterial variability associated with the life stages of the C. nigripalpus was largely unaffected by levels of nutrient enrichments that impacted larval microbial resources, including bacteria, ciliates, and flagellates in the larval environments. IMPORTANCE Mosquito microbiota provide important physiological and ecological attributes to mosquitoes, including an impact on their susceptibility to pathogens, fitness, and sensitivity to mosquito control agents. Culex nigripalpus mosquito populations transmit various pathogens, including the Saint Louis and West Nile viruses, and proliferate in nutrient-rich environments, such as in wastewater treatment wetlands.

TI  - Elucidating the role of dsRNA sensing and Toll6 in antiviral responses of Culex quinquefasciatus cells
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - The first step of any immune response is the recognition of foreign molecular structures inside the host organism. An important molecule that is generally foreign to eukaryotic cells is long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which can be generated during virus replication. The mechanisms of sensing viral dsRNA are well-studied in mammalian systems but are only poorly understood in insects, including disease vectors such as Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. These mosquitoes are vectors for important arboviruses, such as West Nile virus, and Culex species mosquitoes are distributed across the globe in many temperate and tropical regions. The major antiviral response triggered by dsRNA in mosquitoes is RNA interference – a sequence-specific response which targets complementary viral RNA for degradation. However, here, we aimed to identify whether sequence-independent dsRNA sensing, mimicked by poly(I:C), can elicit an antiviral response. We observed a significant reduction in replication of La Crosse virus (LACV) in Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquito cells following poly(I:C) priming. We identified a number of antimicrobial peptides and Toll receptors that were upregulated at the transcript level by poly(I:C) stimulation. Notably, Toll6 was upregulated and we determined that a knockdown of Toll6 expression resulted also in increased LACV replication. Future efforts require genetic tools to validate whether the observed Toll6 antiviral activity is indeed linked to dsRNA sensing. However, large-scale functional genomic and proteomic approaches are also required to determine which downstream responses are part of the poly(I:C) elicited antiviral response.

EP  - 671
AB  - Abstract Neurological infections are often devastating in their clinical presentation. Although significant advances have made in neuroimaging techniques and molecular tools for diagnosis, as well as in anti-infective therapy, these diseases always difficult to diagnose and treat. Neuroparasitic infections and virus infections lead to neurological infections. In the nervous system, various cytokines and chemokines act as neuroinflammatory agents, neuromodulators, regulate neurodevelopment, and synaptic transmission. Among the most important cytokines, interleukins (ILs) are a large group of immunomodulatory proteins that elicit a wide variety of responses in cells and tissues. These ILs are involved in pro and anti-inflammatory effects, systemic inflammation, immune system modulation and play crucial roles in fighting cancer, infectious disease, and neurological disorders. Interleukin-34 (IL-34) identified by screening a comprehensive human protein library containing ∼3400 secreted and extracellular domain proteins in a human monocyte viability assay. Recent evidence has disclosed the crucial roles of IL-34 in the proliferation and differentiation of mononuclear phagocyte lineage cells, osteoclastogenesis, and inflammation. Additionally, IL-34 plays an important role in development, homeostasis, and disease. Dysregulation in IL-34 function can lead to various inflammatory and infectious diseases (e.g. Inflammatory bowel disease, liver fibrosis, Systemic Lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), neurological disorders (e.g. Alzheimer disease) and neurological infectious disease (e.g. West Nile virus disease). In this review, we explore the biological role of IL-34 in addition to various impairments caused by dysregulation in IL-34 and discuss their potential links that may lead to important therapeutic and/or preventive strategies for these disorders.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 72

EP  - 5977
AB  - ABSTRACT Kunjin virus (KUN) replicon RNA was encapsidated by a procedure involving two consecutive electroporations of BHK-21 cells, first with KUN replicon RNA C20DXrep (with prME and most of C deleted) and about 24 h later with a recombinant Semliki Forest virus (SFV) replicon RNA(s) expressing KUN structural proteins. The presence of KUN replicon RNA in encapsidated particles was demonstrated by its amplification and expression in newly infected BHK-21 cells, detected by Northern blotting with a KUN-specific probe and by immunofluorescence analysis with anti-NS3 antibodies. No infectious particles were produced when C20DXrep RNA and recombinant SFV RNAs were electroporated simultaneously. When the second electroporation was performed with a single SFV replicon RNA expressing the KUN contiguous prME genes and the KUN C gene together but under control of two separate 26S subgenomic promoters (SFV-prME-C107), a 10-fold-higher titer of infectious particles was achieved than when two different SFV replicon RNAs expressing the KUN C gene (SFV-C107) and prME genes (SFV-prME) separately were used. No SFV replicon RNAs expressing KUN structural proteins were encapsidated in secreted particles. Infectious particles pelleted by ultracentrifugation of the culture fluid from cells sequentially transfected with C20DXrep and SFV-prME-C107 RNAs were neutralized by preincubation with monoclonal antibodies to KUN E protein. Radioimmunoprecipitation analysis with anti-E antibodies of the culture fluid of the doubly transfected cells showed the presence of C, prM/M, and E proteins in the immunoprecipitated particles. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that the immunoprecipitated particles also contained KUN-specific RNA. The encapsidated replicon particles sedimented more slowly than KUN virions in a 5 to 25% sucrose density gradient and were uniformly spherical, with an ∼35-nm diameter, compared with ∼50 nm for KUN virions. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time packaging of flavivirus RNA intrans, and they exclude a role in packaging for virtually all of the structural region. Possible applications of the developed packaging system include the definition of the packaging signal(s) in flavivirus RNA as well as the amino acid motif(s) in the structural proteins involved in RNA encapsidation, virion assembly, and secretion. Furthermore, it could facilitate the development of a noninfectious vaccine delivery system based on encapsidation of a noncytopathic flavivirus replicon expressing heterologous genes.

TI  - Endocytosis of flavivirus NS1 is required for NS1-mediated endothelial hyperpermeability and is abolished by a single N-glycosylation site mutation
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 15
AB  - Arthropod-borne flaviviruses cause life-threatening diseases associated with endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leak. We recently found that vascular leak can be triggered by dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) via the disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer (EGL). However, the molecular determinants of NS1 required to trigger EGL disruption and the cellular pathway(s) involved remain unknown. Here we report that mutation of a single glycosylated residue of NS1 (N207Q) abolishes the ability of NS1 to trigger EGL disruption and induce endothelial hyperpermeability. Intriguingly, while this mutant bound to the surface of endothelial cells comparably to wild-type NS1, it was no longer internalized, suggesting that NS1 binding and internalization are distinct steps. Using endocytic pathway inhibitors and gene-specific siRNAs, we determined that NS1 was endocytosed into endothelial cells in a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent manner, which was required to trigger endothelial dysfunction in vitro and vascular leak in vivo. Finally, we found that the N207 glycosylation site is highly conserved among flaviviruses and is also essential for West Nile and Zika virus NS1 to trigger endothelial hyperpermeability via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These data provide critical mechanistic insight into flavivirus NS1-induced pathogenesis, presenting novel therapeutic and vaccine targets for flaviviral diseases.

TI  - Envelope Protein Glycosylation Status Influences Mouse Neuroinvasion Phenotype of Genetic Lineage 1 West Nile Virus Strains
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 8339
EP  - 8347
AB  - ABSTRACT The introduction of West Nile virus (WNV) into North America has been associated with relatively high rates of neurological disease and death in humans, birds, horses, and some other animals. Previous studies identified strains in both genetic lineage 1 and genetic lineage 2, including North American isolates of lineage 1, that were highly virulent in a mouse neuroinvasion model, while other strains were avirulent or significantly attenuated (D. W. C. Beasley, L. Li, M. T. Suderman, and A. D. T. Barrett, Virology 296:17-23, 2002). To begin to elucidate the basis for these differences, we compared a highly virulent New York 1999 (NY99) isolate with a related Old World lineage 1 strain, An4766 (ETH76a), which is attenuated for mouse neuroinvasion. Genomic sequencing of ETH76a revealed a relatively small number of nucleotide (5.1%) and amino acid (0.6%) differences compared with NY99. These differences were located throughout the genome and included five amino acid differences in the envelope protein gene. Substitution of premembrane and envelope genes of ETH76a into a NY99 infectious clone backbone yielded a virus with altered in vitro growth characteristics and a mouse virulence phenotype comparable to ETH76a. Further site-specific mutagenesis studies revealed that the altered phenotype was primarily mediated via loss of envelope protein glycosylation and that this was associated with altered stability of the virion at mildly acidic pH. Therefore, the enhanced virulence of North American WNV strains compared with other Old World lineage 1 strains is at least partly mediated by envelope protein glycosylation.

AB  - The hallmark attribute of North American West Nile virus (WNV) strains has been high pathogenicity in certain bird species. Surprisingly, this avian virulent WNV phenotype has not been observed during its geographical expansion into the Caribbean, Central America and South America. One WNV variant (TM171-03-pp1) isolated in Mexico has demonstrated an attenuated phenotype in two widely distributed North American bird species, American crows (AMCRs) and house sparrows (HOSPs). In order to identify genetic determinants associated with attenuated avian replication of the TM171-03-pp1 variant, chimeric viruses between the NY99 and Mexican strains were generated, and their replicative capacity was assessed in cell culture and in AMCR, HOSP and house finch avian hosts. The results demonstrated that mutations in both the pre-membrane (prM-I141T) and envelope (E-S156P) genes mediated the attenuation phenotype of the WNV TM171-03-pp1 variant in a chicken macrophage cell line and in all three avian species assayed. Inclusion of the prM-I141T and E-S156P TM171-03-pp1 mutations in the NY99 backbone was necessary to achieve the avian attenuation level of the Mexican virus. Furthermore, reciprocal incorporation of both prM-T141I and E-P156S substitutions into the Mexican virus genome was necessary to generate a virus that exhibited avian virulence equivalent to the NY99 virus. These structural changes may indicate the presence of new evolutionary pressures exerted on WNV populations circulating in Latin America or may signify a genetic bottleneck that has constrained their epiornitic potential in alternative geographical locations.

TI  - Envelope protein of the flavivirus Kunjin is apparently not glycosylated.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 59 Pt 1
SP  - 29
EP  - 38
AB  - The envelope protein E (formerly designated V3) of the flavivirus Kunjin was not labelled with radioactive galactose, mannose or glucosamine during virus growth in Vero cells. On electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, the envelope (E) protein migrated more rapidly than related intracellular virus-specified glycoproteins. Furthermore, E had a density in CsCl solution consistent with that of a protein lacking carbohydrate, and did not bind to concanavalin A-agarose. In contrast, the envelope glycoprotein of Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) did bind to concanavalin A under similar conditions and was readily labelled with radioactive mannose. These results suggested that the E protein of Kunjin virus was not glycosylated, a feature not shared with MVEV and West Nile virus (WNV), whose properties were consistent with the presence of oligosaccharides attached to the envelope proteins. When Kunjin virions were labelled with radioactive glucosamine, the label was contained in GP19 (formerly NV2). The glycopeptides derived by Pronase digestion of GP19 from Kunjin virions were larger than those derived from GP19 obtained from infected cells.

TI  - Enzymatic Characterization and Homology Model of a Catalytically Active Recombinant West Nile Virus NS3 Protease*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 279
SP  - 48535
EP  - 48542
AB  - West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus with a rapidly expanding global distribution. Infection causes severe neurological disease and fatalities in both human and animal hosts. The West Nile viral protease (NS2B-NS3) is essential for post-translational processing in host-infected cells of a viral polypeptide precursor into structural and functional viral proteins, and its inhibition could represent a potential treatment for viral infections. This article describes the design, expression, and enzymatic characterization of a catalytically active recombinant WNV protease, consisting of a 40-residue component of cofactor NS2B tethered via a noncleavable nonapeptide (G4SG4) to the N-terminal 184 residues of NS3. A chromogenic assay using synthetic para-nitroanilide (pNA) hexapeptide substrates was used to identify optimal enzyme-processing conditions (pH 9.5, I < 0.1 m, 30% glycerol, 1 mm CHAPS), preferred substrate cleavage sites, and the first competitive inhibitor (Ac-FASGKR-H, IC50 ∼1 μm). A putative three-dimensional structure of WNV protease, created through homology modeling based on the crystal structures of Dengue-2 and Hepatitis C NS3 viral proteases, provides some valuable insights for structure-based design of potent and selective inhibitors of WNV protease.

TI  - Essential Role of Cyclization Sequences in Flavivirus RNA Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 75
SP  - 6719
EP  - 6728
AB  - ABSTRACT A possible role in RNA replication for interactions between conserved complementary (cyclization) sequences in the 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of Flavivirus RNA was previously suggested but never tested in vivo. Using the M-fold program for RNA secondary-structure predictions, we examined for the first time the base-pairing interactions between the covalently linked 5′ genomic region (first ∼160 nucleotides) and the 3′ untranslated region (last ∼115 nucleotides) for a range of mosquito-borneFlavivirus species. Base-pairing occurred as predicted for the previously proposed conserved cyclization sequences. In order to obtain experimental evidence of the predicted interactions, the putative cyclization sequences (5′ or 3′) in the replicon RNA of the mosquito-borne Kunjin virus were mutated either separately, to destroy base-pairing, or simultaneously, to restore the complementarity. None of the RNAs with separate mutations in only the 5′ or only the 3′ cyclization sequences was able to replicate after transfection into BHK cells, while replicon RNA with simultaneous compensatory mutations in both cyclization sequences was replication competent. This was detected by immunofluorescence for expression of the major nonstructural protein NS3 and by Northern blot analysis for amplification and accumulation of replicon RNA. We then used the M-fold program to analyze RNA secondary structure of the covalently linked 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of three tick-borne virus species and identified a previously undescribed additional pair of conserved complementary sequences in locations similar to those of the mosquito-borne species. They base-paired with ΔG values of approximately −20 kcal, equivalent or greater in stability than those calculated for the originally proposed cyclization sequences. The results show that the base-pairing between 5′ and 3′ complementary sequences, rather than the nucleotide sequence per se, is essential for the replication of mosquito-borne Kunjin virus RNA and that more than one pair of cyclization sequences might be involved in the replication of the tick-borne Flavivirusspecies.

TI  - Evasion and disruption of innate immune signalling by hepatitis C and West Nile viruses
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Signalling pathways leading to type I interferon production are the first line of defence employed by the host to combat viruses, and represent a barrier that an invading virus must overcome in order to establish infection. In this review we highlight the ability of two members of the Flaviviridae, a globally distributed family of RNA viruses that represent a significant public health concern, to disrupt and evade these defences. Hepatitis C virus is a hepatotropic virus, infecting greater than 170 million people worldwide, while West Nile virus is a neurotropic virus that causes encephalitis in humans and horses. While these viruses cause distinct disease phenotypes, the ability of pathogenic strains to modulate the innate immune response is a key factor in influencing disease outcome. Both viruses have evolved unique strategies to target various aspects of type I interferon induction and signalling in order to prevent viral clearance and to promote virus replication.

TI  - Evidence for a Genetic and Physical Interaction between Nonstructural Proteins NS1 and NS4B That Modulates Replication of West Nile Virus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 7360
EP  - 7371
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus NS1 is a nonstructural glycoprotein that is expressed on the cell surface and secreted into the extracellular space. Despite its transit through the secretory pathway, NS1 is an essential gene linked to early viral RNA replication. How this occurs has remained a mystery given the disparate localization of NS1 and the viral RNA replication complex, as the latter is present on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We recently identified an N-terminal di-amino acid motif in NS1 that modulates protein targeting and affected viral replication. Exchange of two amino acids at positions 10 and 11 from dengue virus (DENV) into West Nile virus (WNV) NS1 (RQ10NK) changed its relative surface expression and secretion and attenuated infectivity. However, the phenotype of WNV containing NS1 RQ10NK was unstable, as within two passages heterogeneous plaque variants were observed. Here, using a mutant WNV encoding the NS1 RQ10NK mutation, we identified a suppressor mutation (F86C) in NS4B, a virally encoded transmembrane protein with loops on both the luminal and cytoplasmic sides of the ER membrane. Introduction of NS4B F86C specifically rescued RNA replication of mutant WNV but did not affect the wild-type virus. Mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation studies established a novel physical interaction between NS1 and NS4B, suggesting a mechanism for how luminal NS1 conveys signals to the cytoplasm to regulate RNA replication.

JF  - Biochemistry
VL  - 35 13
SP  - 4222
EP  - 30
AB  - The 3'-terminal nucleotides of the flavivirus genomic RNA form conserved secondary structures that may function as cis-acting signals for RNA replication. Here we provide evidence for the existence of a conserved pseudoknot structure at the 3' terminus of the flavivirus genomic RNA. A truncated version of the West Nile virus (WNV) 3'-terminal RNA sequence was used as the model for these studies. Circular dichroism spectra indicated the presence of a highly structured RNA conformation with a significant amount of A-form helix. Ribonuclease probing not only confirmed the presence of the predicted secondary structure, which consists of a long stem-loop (SL1) and a shorter stem-loop (SL2), but also suggested that base pairing occurs between nucleotides in the loop of SL2 and those in an internal loop strand located on the 5' side of SL1. Analysis of three mutant RNAs further supported the existence of pseudoknot interactions. UV-melting analysis of the WNV 3' model RNA showed three transitions with significant hyperchromicity at approximately 46, 62, and 79 degrees C. UV-melting analysis with either SL1 or SL2 RNA alone suggested that the 62 and 79 degree C transitions represent the unfolding of SL2 and SL1, respectively. The 46 degree C transition is most likely due to the opening of the proposed tertiary structure. A similar melting curve was obtained for another flavivirus (dengue-3 virus) 3'-terminal RNA, providing further support for the conservation of the structure among flaviviruses. Molecular modeling of the RNA indicated that a pseudoknot structure is a stereochemically and energetically reasonable model for the 3' terminus of flavivirus genomic RNA.

EP  - 12
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that is maintained in a bird-mosquito transmission cycle. Humans, horses and other non-avian vertebrates are usually incidental hosts. However, WNV is a neurotropic virus, which requires an efficient humoral response for the control of a neuroinvasive infection. The WNV genome encodes three structural (capsid, premembrane/membrane and envelope) and seven non-structural proteins. Bioinformatic analysis performed on the WNV genomes detected a conserved alternative open reading frame restricted to the lineage I virus. To quickly verify the existence of this putative protein, entitled West Nile Alternative Reading Frame 4 (WARF4), we produced a prokaryotic recombinant source of WARF4 and verified its immunogenicity in vivo by analyzing 43 horse serum samples, of which 15 were positive for antibodies to WNV premembrane and envelope (prM-E) proteins. Specific antibodies to WARF4 were significantly detected in 5 out of the 15 serum samples testing positive for antibodies to prM-E WNV proteins. Our findings provide evidence of a significant antibody response to the WARF4 protein in the serum of the horse testing positive for antibodies to prM-E proteins, thus indicating that this antigen might be a potential tool for further characterization of the immune response of WNV infections in humans as well.

TI  - Exclusion of West Nile Virus Superinfection through RNA Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83
SP  - 11765
EP  - 11776
AB  - ABSTRACT Superinfection exclusion is the ability of an established viral infection to interfere with a second viral infection. Using West Nile virus (WNV) as a model, we show that replicating replicons in BHK-21 cells suppress subsequent WNV infection. The WNV replicon also suppresses superinfections of other flaviviruses but not nonflaviviruses. Mode-of-action analysis indicates that the exclusion of WNV superinfection occurs at the step of RNA synthesis. The continuous culturing of WNV in the replicon-containing cells generated variants that could overcome the superinfection exclusion. The sequencing of the selected viruses revealed mutations in structural (prM S90R or envelope E138K) and nonstructural genes (NS4a K124R and peptide 2K V9M). Mutagenesis analysis showed that the mutations in structural genes nonselectively enhance viral infection in both naïve and replicon-containing BHK-21 cells; in contrast, the mutations in nonstructural genes more selectively enhance viral replication in the replicon-containing cells than in the naïve cells. Mechanistic analysis showed that the envelope mutation functions through the enhancement of virion attachment to BHK-21 cells, whereas the 2K mutation (and, to a lesser extent, the NS4a mutation) functions through the enhancement of viral RNA synthesis. Furthermore, we show that WNV superinfection exclusion is reversible by the treatment of the replicon cells with a flavivirus inhibitor. The preestablished replication of the replicon could be suppressed by infecting the cells with the 2K mutant WNV but not with the wild-type virus. These results suggest that WNV superinfection exclusion is a result of competition for intracellular host factors that are required for viral RNA synthesis.

TI  - Exocytosis and Fas mediated cytolytic mechanisms exert protection from West Nile virus induced encephalitis in mice
JF  - Immunology and Cell Biology
VL  - 82
AB  - Infection of mice with the flaviviruses West Nile virus (WNV) and Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) induces cytolytic T‐cell responses which are highly cross‐reactive on target cells infected with heterologous flaviviruses. Of C57BL/6 mice infected with low doses (102−106 PFU) of either virus, 30−40% develop encephalitis and die within 10−12 days1, 2. Mice with defects in the Fas or granule exocytosis (perforin and granzymes A and B) pathway of cellular cytotoxicity display reduced mortality and increased survival time when infected with MVE and are protected from encephalitis when deficient in both pathways. This contrasts with infection with WNV where defects in these cytolytic mechanisms increase the percentage of mice that succumb to encephalitis. Thus, no generalizations as to protective or detrimental effects of cytolytic effector functions in recovery from closely related flavivirus infections can be made. Virus−host immune interactions have to be assessed individually and cannot be generalized.

In this study, we show for the first time that a cell line from medically important arthropods, such as ticks, secretes extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes that mediate transmission of flavivirus RNA and proteins to the human cells. Our study shows that tick-borne Langat virus (LGTV), a model pathogen closely related to tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), profusely uses arthropod exosomes for transmission of viral RNA and proteins to the human- skin keratinocytes and blood endothelial cells. Cryo-electron microscopy showed the presence of purified arthropod/neuronal exosomes with the size range of 30 to 200 nm in diameter. Both positive and negative strands of LGTV RNA and viral envelope-protein were detected inside exosomes derived from arthropod, murine and human cells. Detection of Nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein in arthropod and neuronal exosomes further suggested that exosomes contain viral proteins. Viral RNA and proteins in exosomes derived from tick and mammalian cells were secured, highly infectious and replicative in all tested evaluations. Treatment with GW4869, a selective inhibitor that blocks exosome release affected LGTV loads in both arthropod and mammalian cell-derived exosomes. Transwell-migration assays showed that exosomes derived from infected-brain-microvascular endothelial cells (that constitute the blood-brain barrier) facilitated LGTV RNA and protein transmission, crossing of the barriers and infection of neuronal cells. Neuronal infection showed abundant loads of both tick-borne LGTV and mosquito-borne West Nile virus RNA in exosomes. Our data also suggest that exosome-mediated LGTV viral transmission is clathrin-dependent. Collectively, our results suggest that flaviviruses uses arthropod-derived exosomes as a novel means for viral RNA and protein transmission from the vector, and the vertebrate exosomes for dissemination within the host that may subsequently allow neuroinvasion and neuropathogenesis.

AB  - Complex interactions between microbial residents of mosquitoes and arboviruses are likely to influence many aspects of vectorial capacity and could potentially have profound effects on patterns of arbovirus transmission. Such interactions have not been well studied for West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) and Culex spp. mosquitoes. We utilized next-generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial genes derived from Culex pipiens Linnaeus following WNV exposure and/or infection and compared bacterial populations and broad immune responses to unexposed mosquitoes. Our results demonstrate that WNV infection increases the diversity of bacterial populations and is associated with up-regulation of classical invertebrate immune pathways including RNA interference (RNAi), Toll, and Jak-STAT (Janus kinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription). In addition, WNV exposure alone, without the establishment of infection, results in similar alterations to microbial and immune signatures, although to a lesser extent. Multiple bacterial genera were found in greater abundance in WNV-exposed and/or infected mosquitoes, yet the most consistent and notable was the genus Serratia.

TI  - Expression of Mosquito MicroRNA Aae-miR-2940-5p Is Downregulated in Response to West Nile Virus Infection To Restrict Viral Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 8457
EP  - 8467
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome from the Flaviviridae family. WNV is spread by mosquitoes and able to infect humans, causing encephalitis and meningitis that can be fatal; it therefore presents a significant risk for human health. In insects, innate response to RNA virus infection mostly relies on RNA interference and JAK/SAT pathways; however, some evidence indicates that it can also involve microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at posttranscriptional level and play an important role in a number of processes, including immunity and antiviral response. In this study, we focus on the miRNA-mediated response to WNV in mosquito cells. We demonstrate that in response to WNV infection the expression of a mosquito-specific miRNA, aae-miR-2940, is selectively downregulated in Aedes albopictus cells. This miRNA is known to upregulate the metalloprotease m41 FtsH gene, which we have also shown to be required for efficient WNV replication. Correspondingly, downregulation of aae-miR-2940 reduced the metalloprotease level and restricted WNV replication. Thus, we have identified a novel miRNA-dependent mechanism of antiviral response to WNV in mosquitoes. IMPORTANCE A detailed understanding of vector-pathogen interactions is essential to address the problems posed by vector-borne diseases. Host and viral miRNAs play an important role in regulating expression of viral and host genes involved in endogenous processes, including antiviral response. There has been no evidence to date for the role of mosquito miRNAs in response to flaviviruses. In this study, we show that downregulation of aae-miR-2940 in mosquito cells acts as a potential antiviral mechanism in the mosquito host to inhibit WNV replication by repressing the expression of the metalloprotease m41 FtsH gene, which is required for efficient WNV replication. This is the first identification of an miRNA-dependent antiviral mechanism in mosquitoes, which inhibits replication of WNV. Our findings should facilitate identification of targets in the mosquito genome that can be utilized to suppress vector population and/or limit WNV replication.

SP  - 122
EP  - 32
AB  - Dengue virus type 2 (DEN2), a member of the Flaviviridae family of positive-strand RNA viruses, contains a single RNA genome having a type I cap structure at the 5' end. The viral RNA is translated to produce a single polyprotein precursor that is processed to yield three virion proteins and at least seven nonstructural proteins (NS) in the infected host. NS3 is a multifunctional protein having a serine protease catalytic triad within the N-terminal 180 amino acid residues which requires NS2B as a cofactor for activation of protease activity. The C-terminal portion of this catalytic triad has conserved motifs present in several nucleoside triphosphatases (NTPases)/RNA helicases. In addition, subtilisin-treated West Nile (WN) virus NS3 from infected cells was reported to have 5'-RNA triphosphatase activity, suggesting its role in the synthesis of the 5'-cap structure. In this study, full-length DEN2 NS3 was expressed with an N-terminal histidine tag in Escherichia coli and purified in a soluble form. The purified protein has 5'-RNA triphosphatase activity that cleaves the gamma-phosphate moiety of the 5'-triphosphorylated RNA substrate. Biochemical and mutational analyses of the NS3 protein indicate that the nucleoside triphosphatase and 5'-RNA triphosphatase activities of NS3 share a common active site.

TI  - Extension of Flavivirus Protein C Differentially Affects Early RNA Synthesis and Growth in Mammalian and Arthropod Host Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83
SP  - 11201
EP  - 11210
AB  - ABSTRACT The translation of flaviviral RNA genomes yields a single polyprotein that is processed into the mature proteins by viral and host cell proteases. Mature capsid protein C is freed from the polyprotein by the viral NS2B/3 protease, cleaving in the C-terminal region of protein C in front of the signal sequence for prM. Protein C has been shown to be involved in viral assembly and RNA packaging. To examine further the role of protein C and its production by proteolysis, we replaced the NS2B/3 capsid cleavage site in tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) by the 2A protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus (TBEV-2A and WNV-2A). This obviated the need for NS2B/3 processing at the C terminus of mature protein C while simultaneously producing a 19-amino-acid extension on protein C. Infectious virions were generated with both viruses; the phenotype depended on the host cell. TBEV-2A replicated well in BHK-21 cells but was essentially incapable of replication in tick cells. In contrast, WNV-2A replicated well in mosquito cells but showed a small-plaque phenotype in Vero cells, with frequent production of larger plaques. Sequencing of viral RNA from the larger plaques showed substitutions in the signal sequence for prM, presumably improving coordinated protein processing at the C-prM junction. Furthermore, both TBEV-2A and WNV-2A were also defective in unpackaging and/or early RNA synthesis. Together, these results indicate a role for flavivirus protein C in both viral assembly and RNA replication, possibly by interacting with host cell factors required to set up the cell for RNA replication.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 11749
EP  - 11757
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus that causes encephalitis, most frequently in elderly and immunocompromised humans. Previous studies demonstrated that CD8+ T cells utilize perforin-dependent cytolytic mechanisms to limit WNV infection. Nonetheless, the phenotype of perforin-deficient CD8+ T cells was not as severe as that of an absence of CD8+ T cells, suggesting additional effector control mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) interactions to CD8+ T-cell-mediated control of WNV infection. Notably, the cell death receptor Fas was strongly upregulated on neurons in culture and in vivo after WNV infection. gld mice that were functionally deficient in FasL expression showed increased susceptibility to lethal WNV infection. Although antigen-specific priming of CD8+ T cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues was normal in gld mice, increased central nervous system (CNS) viral burdens and delayed clearance were observed. Moreover, the adoptive transfer of WNV-primed wild-type but not gld CD8+ T cells to recipient CD8−/− or gld mice efficiently limited infection in the CNS and enhanced survival rates. Overall, our data suggest that CD8+ T cells also utilize FasL effector mechanisms to contain WNV infection in Fas-expressing neurons in the CNS.

TI  - Fast type I interferon response protects astrocytes from flavivirus infection and virus-induced cytopathic effects
JF  - Journal of Neuroinflammation
VL  - 13
AB  - Neurotropic flaviviruses such as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) are causative agents of severe brain-related diseases including meningitis, encephalitis, and microcephaly. We have previously shown that local type I interferon response within the central nervous system (CNS) is involved in the protection of mice against tick-borne flavivirus infection. However, the cells responsible for mounting this protective response are not defined. Primary astrocytes were isolated from wild-type (WT) and interferon alpha receptor knock out (IFNAR−/−) mice and infected with neurotropic flaviviruses. Viral replication and spread, IFN induction and response, and cellular viability were analyzed. Transcriptional levels in primary astrocytes treated with interferon or supernatant from virus-infected cells were analyzed by RNA sequencing and evaluated by different bioinformatics tools. Here, we show that astrocytes control viral replication of different TBEV strains, JEV, WNV, and ZIKV. In contrast to fibroblast, astrocytes mount a rapid interferon response and restrict viral spread. Furthermore, basal expression levels of key interferon-stimulated genes are high in astrocytes compared to mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Bioinformatic analysis of RNA-sequencing data reveals that astrocytes have established a basal antiviral state which contributes to the rapid viral recognition and upregulation of interferons. The most highly upregulated pathways in neighboring cells were linked to type I interferon response and innate immunity. The restriction in viral growth was dependent on interferon signaling, since loss of the interferon receptor, or its blockade in wild-type cells, resulted in high viral replication and virus-induced cytopathic effects. Astrocyte supernatant from TBEV-infected cells can restrict TBEV growth in astrocytes already 6 h post infection, the effect on neurons is highly reinforced, and astrocyte supernatant from 3 h post infection is already protective. These findings suggest that the combination of an intrinsic constitutive antiviral response and the fast induction of type I IFN production by astrocytes play an important role in self-protection of astrocytes and suppression of flavivirus replication in the CNS.

AB  - Dengue virus and other flaviviruses such as the yellow fever, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses are emerging vector‐borne human pathogens that affect annually more than 100 million individuals and that may cause debilitating and potentially fatal hemorrhagic and encephalitic diseases. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs for the treatment of flavivirus‐associated disease. A better understanding of the flavivirus–host interactions during the different events of the flaviviral life cycle may be essential when developing novel antiviral strategies. The flaviviral non‐structural protein 4b (NS4b) appears to play an important role in flaviviral replication by facilitating the formation of the viral replication complexes and in counteracting innate immune responses such as the following: (i) type I IFN signaling; (ii) RNA interference; (iii) formation of stress granules; and (iv) the unfolded protein response. Intriguingly, NS4b has recently been shown to constitute an excellent target for the selective inhibition of flavivirus replication. We here review the current knowledge on NS4b. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Flaviviruses are a genus of (+)ssRNA (positive ssRNA) enveloped viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of cells of diverse species from arthropods to mammals. Many are important human pathogens such as DENV-1-4 (dengue virus types 1-4), WNV (West Nile virus), YFV (yellow fever virus), JEV (Japanese encephalitis virus) and TBEV (tick-borne encephalitis). Given their RNA genomes it is not surprising that flaviviral life cycles revolve around critical RNA transactions. It is these we highlight in the present article. First, we summarize the mechanisms governing flaviviral replication and the central role of conserved RNA elements and viral protein-RNA interactions in RNA synthesis, translation and packaging. Secondly, we focus on how host RNA-binding proteins both benefit and inhibit flaviviral replication at different stages of their life cycle in mammalian hosts. Thirdly, we cover recent studies on viral non-coding RNAs produced in flavivirus-infected cells and how these RNAs affect various aspects of cellular RNA metabolism. Together, the article puts into perspective the central role of flaviviral RNAs in modulating both viral and cellular functions.

JF  - Viruses
VL  - 7
SP  - 4640
EP  - 4656
AB  - Genome replication in flavivirus requires (−) strand RNA synthesis, (+) strand RNA synthesis, and 5′-RNA capping and methylation. To carry out viral genome replication, flavivirus assembles a replication complex, consisting of both viral and host proteins, on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Two major components of the replication complex are the viral non-structural (NS) proteins NS3 and NS5. Together they possess all the enzymatic activities required for genome replication, yet how these activities are coordinated during genome replication is not clear. We provide an overview of the flaviviral genome replication process, the membrane-bound replication complex, and recent crystal structures of full-length NS5. We propose a model of how NS3 and NS5 coordinate their activities in the individual steps of (−) RNA synthesis, (+) RNA synthesis, and 5′-RNA capping and methylation.

AB  - Members of the Flaviviridae family are posing a significant threat to human health worldwide. Many flaviviruses are capable of inducing severe inflammation in humans. Flaviviridae nonstructural proteins, apart from their canonical roles in viral replication, have noncanonical functions strongly affecting antiviral innate immunity. Among these functions, antagonism of type I IFN is the most investigated; meanwhile, more data are accumulated on their role in the other pathways of innate response. This review systematizes the last known data on the role of Flaviviridae nonstructural proteins in molecular mechanisms of triggering inflammation, with an emphasis on their interactions with TLRs and RLRs, interference with NF-κB and cGAS-STING signaling, and activation of inflammasomes.

TI  - Flavivirus NS1 Structures Reveal Surfaces for Associations with Membranes and the Immune System
JF  - Science
VL  - 343
SP  - 881
EP  - 885
AB  - Two-Faced Viral Protein Flaviviruses cause human diseases such as West Nile fever and dengue fever. The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has multiple functions in flavivirus biology and is a target for vaccine development. Dimeric NS1 is essential for replication of the viral genome inside host cells, while hexameric NS1 is secreted and plays a role in evasion of the immune system. Akey et al. (p. 881, published online 6 February; see the Perspective by Shi) report crystal structures for full-length glycosylated NS1 from West Nile and dengue viruses. The structures show a hexamer comprised of three dimers. The structural analysis together with liposome and mutational studies identify a membrane interacting surface on one face of the dimer and an immune evasion surface on the other. The structure of a viral protein provides a basis for understanding its function and could guide vaccine development. [Also see Perspective by Shi] Flaviviruses, the human pathogens responsible for dengue fever, West Nile fever, tick-borne encephalitis, and yellow fever, are endemic in tropical and temperate parts of the world. The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) functions in genome replication as an intracellular dimer and in immune system evasion as a secreted hexamer. We report crystal structures for full-length, glycosylated NS1 from West Nile and dengue viruses. The NS1 hexamer in crystal structures is similar to a solution hexamer visualized by single-particle electron microscopy. Recombinant NS1 binds to lipid bilayers and remodels large liposomes into lipoprotein nanoparticles. The NS1 structures reveal distinct domains for membrane association of the dimer and interactions with the immune system and are a basis for elucidating the molecular mechanism of NS1 function.

TI  - Flavivirus NS1 Triggers Tissue-Specific Disassembly of Intercellular Junctions Leading to Barrier Dysfunction and Vascular Leak in a GSK-3β-Dependent Manner
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected cells and contributes to endothelial barrier dysfunction and vascular leak in a tissue-dependent manner. This phenomenon occurs in part via disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) lining the endothelium. Additionally, we and others have shown that soluble DENV NS1 induces disassembly of intercellular junctions (IJCs), a group of cellular proteins critical for maintaining endothelial homeostasis and regulating vascular permeability; however, the specific mechanisms by which NS1 mediates IJC disruption remain unclear. Here, we investigated the relative contribution of five flavivirus NS1 proteins, from dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), and yellow fever (YFV) viruses, to the expression and localization of the intercellular junction proteins β-catenin and VE-cadherin in endothelial cells from human umbilical vein and brain tissues. We found that flavivirus NS1 induced the mislocalization of β-catenin and VE-cadherin in a tissue-dependent manner, reflecting flavivirus disease tropism. Mechanistically, we observed that NS1 treatment of cells triggered internalization of VE-cadherin, likely via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and phosphorylation of β-catenin, part of a canonical IJC remodeling pathway during breakdown of endothelial barriers that activates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Supporting this model, we found that a chemical inhibitor of GSK-3β reduced both NS1-induced permeability of human umbilical vein and brain microvascular endothelial cell monolayers in vitro and vascular leakage in a mouse dorsal intradermal model. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction and identify GSK-3β as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of vascular leakage during severe dengue disease.

TI  - Flavivirus NS4A-induced Autophagy Protects Cells against Death and Enhances Virus Replication*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 286
SP  - 22147
EP  - 22159
AB  - Flaviviruses include the most prevalent and medically challenging viruses. Persistent infection with flaviviruses of epithelial cells and hepatocytes that do not undergo cell death is common. Here, we report that, in epithelial cells, up-regulation of autophagy following flavivirus infection markedly enhances virus replication and that one flavivirus gene, NS4A, uniquely determines the up-regulation of autophagy. Dengue-2 and Modoc (a murine flavivirus) kill primary murine macrophages but protect epithelial cells and fibroblasts against death provoked by several insults. The flavivirus-induced protection derives from the up-regulation of autophagy, as up-regulation of autophagy by starvation or inactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin also protects the cells against insult, whereas inhibition of autophagy via inactivation of PI3K nullifies the protection conferred by flavivirus. Inhibition of autophagy also limits replication of both Dengue-2 and Modoc virus in epithelial cells. Expression of flavivirus NS4A is sufficient to induce PI3K-dependent autophagy and to protect cells against death; expression of other viral genes, including NS2A and NS4B, fails to protect cells against several stressors. Flavivirus NS4A protein induces autophagy in epithelial cells and thus protects them from death during infection. As autophagy is vital to flavivirus replication in these cells, NS4A is therefore also identified as a critical determinant of flavivirus replication.

TI  - Flavivirus Nonstructural Protein NS5 Dysregulates HSP90 to Broadly Inhibit JAK/STAT Signaling
JF  - Cells
VL  - 9
AB  - Pathogenic flaviviruses antagonize host cell Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling downstream of interferons α/β. Here, we show that flaviviruses inhibit JAK/STAT signaling induced by a wide range of cytokines beyond interferon, including interleukins. This broad inhibition was mapped to viral nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) binding to cellular heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), resulting in reduced Janus kinase–HSP90 interaction and thus destabilization of unchaperoned JAKs (and other kinase clients) of HSP90 during infection by Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. Our studies implicate viral dysregulation of HSP90 and the JAK/STAT pathway as a critical determinant of cytokine signaling control during flavivirus infection.

JF  - Muscle & Nerve
VL  - 15
SP  - 1271
EP  - 1277
AB  - Infection of human embryonic myoblasts by West Nile virus (WNV), a flavivirus, caused significant upregulation of class I and II MHC expression as determined by flow cytometry. After 48 hours at a multiplicity of infection of 5 pfu/cell, a sixfold increase in MHC class I expression was induced from initially low levels of expression. In contrast, MHC class II was induced de novo to five times the control fluorescence level. At least 70% of the cells were infected as determined using fluorescence microscopy and anti‐WNV antibody labeling. Myoblasts were > 90% pure as shown by anti–Leu‐19 labeling. MHC class I (but not class II) was increased threefold after exposure to virus‐inactivated supernatant from 48‐hour–infected cells, indicating the presence of factor(s) contributing to the MHC class I increase. These findings may be important in establishing a link between viral infection of human cells and induction of inflammatory autoimmune disease. We discuss the possibility of using WNV as an in vivo model. © 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 66 ( Pt 9)
SP  - 1969
EP  - 82
AB  - The mode of entry of West Nile virus (WNV) into the macrophage-like cell line P388D1 was investigated at the electron microscopical level using synchronized infections. The presence of the antiviral monoclonal antibody F6/16A at a concentration that enhanced viral attachment to P388D1 cells ninefold made no difference to the entry pathway of WNV. In both the absence and presence of F6/16A the initial uptake of single viral particles was mediated by coated pits, and started within 30 s of warming the cells to 37 degrees C. Viral particles later appeared in fully or partially coated vesicles and later in uncoated prelysosomal endocytic vacuoles before degradation in lysosomes. However, aggregates of viral particles (five or more virus particles in cross-section), appeared to be phagocytosed whole by cells in a process which involved aggregates being engulfed by extensions of the plasma membrane. This process exhibited a slower time course than the uptake of single viral particles, becoming prominent 15 to 30 min after warming the cells to 37 degrees C. The involvement of a prelysosomal vacuolar compartment in the entry process was shown by a failure to stain for acid phosphatase. This compartment could be specifically loaded with viral particles when viral internalization occurred at 20 degrees C in the presence of 50 mM-ammonium chloride.

TI  - Flavivirus infection induces indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase in human monocyte‐derived macrophages via tumor necrosis factor and NF‐κB
JF  - Journal of Leukocyte Biology
VL  - 91
AB  - Infection with West Nile virus (WNV) via a mosquito bite results in local viral replication in the skin, followed by viremia. Thus, tissue macrophages are ideally located to prevent the dissemination of WNV throughout the host. The current study shows that WNV infection of human monocyte‐derived macrophages (MDM) results in increased WNV mRNA, protein, and infectious virions at 24 h p.i. with a decline in titer after 48 h. Concomitant with viral control was the robust induction of indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase (IDO) and resultant metabolism of L‐tryptophan (L‐Trp) to kynurenine. In WNV‐exposed cultures, IDO protein was induced primarily in noninfected versus viral‐infected MDM. Whereas WNV infection increased the production of IFN‐α, IFN‐β, and TNF, only antibody neutralization of TNF attenuated IDO expression and activity. WNV infection also activated NF‐κB, and inhibition of this pathway with BMS‐345541 abrogated IDO induction. Similar results were also obtained with MDM infected with the related flavivirus, Japanese encephalitis virus. Whereas IDO‐mediated L‐Trp metabolism can exhibit antiviral properties, inhibition of IDO activity in MDM with L‐1‐MT or the addition of excess L‐Trp did not affect viral control. However, culturing MDM in L‐Trp‐deficient medium or overexpression of IDO in cells prior to infection significantly attenuated WNV replication, which was reversed by adding excess L‐Trp. Together, these data support that although IDO is not required by MDM for the clearance of established viral infection, the spread of flavivirus infection is limited by IDO expressed in uninfected, neighboring cells.

TI  - Flavivirus internalization is regulated by a size-dependent endocytic pathway
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 115
SP  - 4246
EP  - 4251
AB  - Significance Flaviviruses are a globally important group of human viral pathogens. These viruses enter cells by hijacking an endocytic pathway, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, used by cells to take up growth factors and nutrients. While most cargo is small, virions are large, and we identified host factors specifically required for the internalization of large cargo including these viruses. These studies define a set of requirements for viral internalization and which may be amenable to therapeutic interventions. Flaviviruses enter host cells through the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the spectrum of host factors required for this process are incompletely understood. Here we found that lymphocyte antigen 6 locus E (LY6E) promotes the internalization of multiple flaviviruses, including West Nile virus, Zika virus, and dengue virus. Perhaps surprisingly, LY6E is dispensable for the internalization of the endogenous cargo transferrin, which is also dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis for uptake. Since viruses are substantially larger than transferrin, we reasoned that LY6E may be required for uptake of larger cargoes and tested this using transferrin-coated beads of similar size as flaviviruses. LY6E was indeed required for the internalization of transferrin-coated beads, suggesting that LY6E is selectively required for large cargo. Cell biological studies found that LY6E forms tubules upon viral infection and bead internalization, and we found that tubule formation was dependent on RNASEK, which is also required for flavivirus internalization, but not transferrin uptake. Indeed, we found that RNASEK is also required for the internalization of transferrin-coated beads, suggesting it functions upstream of LY6E. These LY6E tubules resembled microtubules, and we found that microtubule assembly was required for their formation and flavivirus uptake. Since microtubule end-binding proteins link microtubules to downstream activities, we screened the three end-binding proteins and found that EB3 promotes virus uptake and LY6E tubularization. Taken together, these results highlight a specialized pathway required for the uptake of large clathrin-dependent endocytosis cargoes, including flaviviruses.

TI  - Flavivirus prM interacts with MDA5 and MAVS to inhibit RLR antiviral signaling
JF  - Cell & Bioscience
VL  - 13
AB  - Background Vector-borne flaviviruses, including tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), pose a growing threat to public health worldwide, and have evolved complex mechanisms to overcome host antiviral innate immunity. However, the underlying mechanisms of flavivirus structural proteins to evade host immune response remain elusive. Results We showed that TBEV structural protein, pre-membrane (prM) protein, could inhibit type I interferon (IFN-I) production. Mechanically, TBEV prM interacted with both MDA5 and MAVS and interfered with the formation of MDA5-MAVS complex, thereby impeding the nuclear translocation and dimerization of IRF3 to inhibit RLR antiviral signaling. ZIKV and WNV prM was also demonstrated to interact with both MDA5 and MAVS, while dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) and YFV prM associated only with MDA5 or MAVS to suppress IFN-I production. In contrast, JEV prM could not suppress IFN-I production. Overexpression of TBEV and ZIKV prM significantly promoted the replication of TBEV and Sendai virus. Conclusion Our findings reveal the immune evasion mechanisms of flavivirus prM, which may contribute to understanding flavivirus pathogenicity, therapeutic intervention and vaccine development.

JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 90 13
SP  - 6218
EP  - 22
AB  - Flavivirus protein biosynthesis involves the proteolytic processing of a single polyprotein precursor by host- and virus-encoded proteinases. In this study, the requirement for the proteolytic function of the viral proteinase NS3 for correct processing of a polyprotein segment encompassing the Murray Valley encephalitis virus structural proteins is shown. The NS3-mediated cleavage in the structural polyprotein region presumably releases the capsid protein from its membrane anchor and triggers the appearance of the premembrane (prM) protein. This suggests that cleavage of prM by signal peptidase in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum is under control of a cytoplasmic cleavage catalyzed by a viral proteinase. The function of the viral proteinase is also essential for secretion of flaviviral spike proteins when expressed from cDNA via vaccinia virus recombinants or in COS cell transfections. This has important implications for the design of flavivirus subunit vaccines.

TI  - Flaviviruses Are Sensitive to Inhibition of Thymidine Synthesis Pathways
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 9411
EP  - 9419
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus has emerged as a global health threat to over one-third of humankind. As a positive-strand RNA virus, dengue virus relies on the host cell metabolism for its translation, replication, and egress. Therefore, a better understanding of the host cell metabolic pathways required for dengue virus infection offers the opportunity to develop new approaches for therapeutic intervention. In a recently described screen of known drugs and bioactive molecules, we observed that methotrexate and floxuridine inhibited dengue virus infections at low micromolar concentrations. Here, we demonstrate that all serotypes of dengue virus, as well as West Nile virus, are highly sensitive to both methotrexate and floxuridine, whereas other RNA viruses (Sindbis virus and vesicular stomatitis virus) are not. Interestingly, flavivirus replication was restored by folinic acid, a thymidine precursor, in the presence of methotrexate and by thymidine in the presence of floxuridine, suggesting an unexpected role for thymidine in flavivirus replication. Since thymidine is not incorporated into RNA genomes, it is likely that increased thymidine production is indirectly involved in flavivirus replication. A possible mechanism is suggested by the finding that p53 inhibition restored dengue virus replication in the presence of floxuridine, consistent with thymidine-less stress triggering p53-mediated antiflavivirus effects in infected cells. Our data reveal thymidine synthesis pathways as new and unexpected therapeutic targets for antiflaviviral drug development.

TI  - Flavivirus–Host Interaction Landscape Visualized through Genome-Wide CRISPR Screens
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Flaviviruses comprise several important human pathogens which cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Like any other virus, they are obligate intracellular parasites. Therefore, studying the host cellular factors that promote or restrict their replication and pathogenesis becomes vital. Since inhibiting the host dependency factors or activating the host restriction factors can suppress the viral replication and propagation in the cell, identifying them reveals potential targets for antiviral therapeutics. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has provided an effective means of producing customizable genetic modifications and performing forward genetic screens in a broad spectrum of cell types and organisms. The ease, rapidity, and high reproducibility of CRISPR technology have made it an excellent tool for carrying out genome-wide screens to identify and characterize viral host dependency factors systematically. Here, we review the insights from various Genome-wide CRISPR screens that have advanced our understanding of Flavivirus-Host interactions.

TI  - Flavors of Flaviviral RNA Structure: towards an Integrated View of RNA Function from Translation through Encapsidation
JF  - Bioessays
VL  - 41
AB  - For many viruses, RNA is the holder of genetic information and serves as the template for both replication and translation. While host and viral proteins play important roles in viral decision‐making, the extent to which viral RNA (vRNA) actively participates in translation and replication might be surprising. Here, the focus is on flaviviruses, which include common human scourges such as dengue, West Nile, and Zika viruses, from an RNA‐centric viewpoint. In reviewing more recent findings, an attempt is made to fill knowledge gaps and revisit some canonical views of vRNA structures involved in replication. In particular, alternative views are offered on the nature of the flaviviral promoter and genome cyclization, and the feasibility of refining in vitro‐derived models with modern RNA probing and sequencing methods is pointed out. By tracing vRNA structures from translation through encapsidation, a dynamic molecule closely involved in the self‐regulation of viral replication is revealed.

TI  - Functional Analysis of Mosquito-Borne Flavivirus Conserved Sequence Elements within 3′ Untranslated Region of West Nile Virus by Use of a Reporting Replicon That Differentiates between Viral Translation and RNA Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 77
SP  - 10004
EP  - 10014
AB  - ABSTRACT We have developed a reporting replicon of West Nile virus (WNV) that could be used to quantitatively distinguish viral translation and RNA replication. A Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene was fused in-frame with the open reading frame of a subgenomic replicon in the position where the viral structural region was deleted, resulting in RlucRep. Transfection of BHK cells with RlucRep RNA yielded two distinctive Rluc signal peaks, one between 2 and 10 h and the other after 26 h posttransfection. By contrast, only the 2- to 10-h Rluc signal peak was observed in cells transfected with a mutant replicon containing an inactivated viral polymerase NS5 (RlucRep-NS5mt). Immunofluorescence and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays showed that the levels of viral protein expression and RNA replication increased in cells transfected with the RlucRep but not in those transfected with the RlucRep-NS5mt. These results suggest that the Rluc signal that occurred at 2 to 10 h posttransfection reflects viral translation of the input replicon, while the Rluc activity after 26 h posttransfection represents RNA replication. Using this system, we showed that mutations of conserved sequence (CS) elements within the 3′ untranslated region of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses did not significantly affect WNV translation but severely diminished or completely abolished RNA replication. Mutations of CS1 that blocked the potential base pairing with a conserved sequence in the 5′ region of the capsid gene (5′CS) abolished RNA replication. Restoration of the 5′CS-CS1 interaction rescued viral replication. Replicons containing individual deletions of CS2, repeated CS2 (RCS2), CS3, or RCS3 were viable, but their RNA replication was dramatically compromised. These results demonstrate that genome cyclization through the 5′CS-CS1 interaction is essential for WNV RNA replication, whereas CS2, RCS2, CS3, and RCS3 facilitate, but are dispensable for, WNV replication.

TI  - Functional Characterization of cis and trans Activity of the Flavivirus NS2B-NS3 Protease*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 282
SP  - 12883
EP  - 12892
AB  - Flaviviruses are serious human pathogens for which treatments are generally lacking. The proteolytic maturation of the 375-kDa viral polyprotein is one target for antiviral development. The flavivirus serine protease consists of the N-terminal domain of the multifunctional nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) and an essential 40-residue cofactor (NS2B40) within viral protein NS2B. The NS2B-NS3 protease is responsible for all cytoplasmic cleavage events in viral polyprotein maturation. This study describes the first biochemical characterization of flavivirus protease activity using full-length NS3. Recombinant proteases were created by fusion of West Nile virus (WNV) NS2B40 to full-length WNV NS3. The protease catalyzed two autolytic cleavages. The NS2B/NS3 junction was cleaved before protein purification. A second site at Arg459↓Gly460 within the C-terminal helicase region of NS3 was cleaved more slowly. Autolytic cleavage reactions also occurred in NS2B-NS3 recombinant proteins from yellow fever virus, dengue virus types 2 and 4, and Japanese encephalitis virus. Cis and trans cleavages were distinguished using a noncleavable WNV protease variant and two types of substrates as follows: an inactive variant of recombinant WNV NS2B-NS3, and cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins fused by a dodecamer peptide encompassing a natural cleavage site. With these materials, the autolytic cleavages were found to be intramolecular only. Autolytic cleavage of the helicase site was insensitive to protein dilution, confirming that autolysis is intramolecular. Formation of an active protease was found to require neither cleavage of NS2B from NS3 nor a free NS3 N terminus. Evidence was also obtained for product inhibition of the protease by the cleaved C terminus of NS2B.

TI  - Functional Information Stored in the Conserved Structural RNA Domains of Flavivirus Genomes
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - The genus Flavivirus comprises a large number of small, positive-sense single-stranded, RNA viruses able to replicate in the cytoplasm of certain arthropod and/or vertebrate host cells. The genus, which has some 70 member species, includes a number of emerging and re-emerging pathogens responsible for outbreaks of human disease around the world, such as the West Nile, dengue, Zika, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Like other RNA viruses, flaviviruses have a compact RNA genome that efficiently stores all the information required for the completion of the infectious cycle. The efficiency of this storage system is attributable to supracoding elements, i.e., discrete, structural units with essential functions. This information storage system overlaps and complements the protein coding sequence and is highly conserved across the genus. It therefore offers interesting potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes our knowledge of the features of flavivirus genome functional RNA domains. It also provides a brief overview of the main achievements reported in the design of antiviral nucleic acid-based drugs targeting functional genomic RNA elements.

TI  - Functional Roles and Host Interactions of Orthoflavivirus Non-Structural Proteins During Replication
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - Orthoflavivirus, a genus encompassing arthropod-borne, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses in the Flaviviridae family, represents clinically relevant viruses that pose significant threats to human and animal health worldwide. With warming climates and persistent urbanization, arthropod vectors and the viruses they transmit continue to widen their geographic distribution, expanding endemic zones. Flaviviruses such as dengue virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus cause debilitating and fatal infections globally. In 2024, the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization declared the current dengue situation a Multi-Country Grade 3 Outbreak, the highest level. FDA-approved treatment options for diseases caused by flaviviruses are limited or non-existent, and vaccines are suboptimal for many flaviviruses. Understanding the molecular characteristics of the flavivirus life cycle, virus-host interactions, and resulting pathogenesis in various cells and model systems is critical for developing effective therapeutic intervention strategies. This review will focus on the virus-host interactions of mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses from the virus replication and assembly perspective, emphasizing the interplay between viral non-structural proteins and host pathways that are hijacked for their advantage. Highlighting interaction pathways, including innate immunity, intracellular movement, and membrane modification, emphasizes the need for rigorous and targeted antiviral research and development against these re-emerging viruses.

JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 183
SP  - 650
EP  - 660
AB  - West Nile virus is an emerging pathogen that can cause fatal neurological disease. A recombinant human mAb, mAb11, has been described as a candidate for the prevention and treatment of West Nile disease. Using a yeast surface display epitope mapping assay and neutralization escape mutant, we show that mAb11 recognizes the fusion loop, at the distal end of domain II of the West Nile virus envelope protein. Ab mAb11 cross-reacts with all four dengue viruses and provides protection against dengue (serotypes 2 and 4) viruses. In contrast to the parental West Nile virus, a neutralization escape variant failed to cause lethal encephalitis (at higher infectious doses) or induce the inflammatory responses associated with blood-brain barrier permeability in mice, suggesting an important role for the fusion loop in viral pathogenesis. Our data demonstrate that an intact West Nile virus fusion loop is critical for virulence, and that human mAb11 targeting this region is efficacious against West Nile virus infection. These experiments define the molecular determinant on the envelope protein recognized by mAb11 and demonstrate the importance of this region in causing West Nile encephalitis.

TI  - G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 2 Promotes Flaviviridae Entry and Replication
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 6
AB  - Flaviviruses cause a wide range of severe diseases ranging from encephalitis to hemorrhagic fever. Discovery of host factors that regulate the fate of flaviviruses in infected cells could provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of infection and therefore facilitate the development of anti-flaviviral drugs. We performed genome-scale siRNA screens to discover human host factors required for yellow fever virus (YFV) propagation. Using a 2×2 siRNA pool screening format and a duplicate of the screen, we identified a high confidence list of YFV host factors. To find commonalities between flaviviruses, these candidates were compared to host factors previously identified for West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV). This comparison highlighted a potential requirement for the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family, GRKs, for flaviviral infection. The YFV host candidate GRK2 (also known as ADRBK1) was validated both in siRNA-mediated knockdown HuH-7 cells and in GRK−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Additionally, we showed that GRK2 was required for efficient propagation of DENV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) indicating that GRK2 requirement is conserved throughout the Flaviviridae. Finally, we found that GRK2 participates in multiple distinct steps of the flavivirus life cycle by promoting both entry and RNA synthesis. Together, our findings identified GRK2 as a novel regulator of flavivirus infection and suggest that inhibition of GRK2 function may constitute a new approach for treatment of flavivirus associated diseases.

TI  - GRP78 Is an Important Host Factor for Japanese Encephalitis Virus Entry and Replication in Mammalian Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Southeast Asia with potential to become a global pathogen. Here, we identify glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) as an important host protein for virus entry and replication. Using the plasma membrane fractions from mouse neuronal (Neuro2a) cells, mass spectroscopy analysis identified GRP78 as a protein interacting with recombinant JEV envelope protein domain III. GRP78 was found to be expressed on the plasma membranes of Neuro2a cells, mouse primary neurons, and human epithelial Huh-7 cells. Antibodies against GRP78 significantly inhibited JEV entry in all three cell types, suggesting an important role of the protein in virus entry. Depletion of GRP78 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly blocked JEV entry into Neuro2a cells, further supporting its role in virus uptake. Immunofluorescence studies showed extensive colocalization of GRP78 with JEV envelope protein in virus-infected cells. This interaction was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation studies. Additionally, GRP78 was shown to have an important role in JEV replication, as treatment of cells post-virus entry with subtilase cytotoxin that specifically cleaved GRP78 led to a substantial reduction in viral RNA replication and protein synthesis, resulting in significantly reduced extracellular virus titers. Our results indicate that GRP78, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperon of the HSP70 family, is a novel host factor involved at multiple steps of the JEV life cycle and could be a potential therapeutic target. IMPORTANCE Recent years have seen a rapid spread of mosquito-borne diseases caused by flaviviruses. The flavivirus family includes West Nile, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and Zika viruses, which are major threats to public health with potential to become global pathogens. JEV is the major cause of viral encephalitis in several parts of Southeast Asia, affecting a predominantly pediatric population with a high mortality rate. This study is focused on identification of crucial host factors that could be targeted to cripple virus infection and ultimately lead to development of effective antivirals. We have identified a cellular protein, GRP78, that plays a dual role in virus entry and virus replication, two crucial steps of the virus life cycle, and thus is a novel host factor that could be a potential therapeutic target.

TI  - Gamma Interferon Plays a Crucial Early Antiviral Role in Protection against West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 5338
EP  - 5348
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) causes a severe central nervous system (CNS) infection in humans, primarily in the elderly and immunocompromised. Prior studies have established an essential protective role of several innate immune response elements, including alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β), immunoglobulin M, γδ T cells, and complement against WNV infection. In this study, we demonstrate that a lack of IFN-γ production or signaling results in increased vulnerability to lethal WNV infection by a subcutaneous route in mice, with a rise in mortality from 30% (wild-type mice) to 90% (IFN-γ−/− or IFN-γR−/− mice) and a decrease in the average survival time. This survival pattern in IFN-γ−/− and IFN-γR−/− mice correlated with higher viremia and greater viral replication in lymphoid tissues. The increase in peripheral infection led to early CNS seeding since infectious WNV was detected several days earlier in the brains and spinal cords of IFN-γ−/− or IFN-γR−/− mice. Bone marrow reconstitution experiments showed that γδ T cells require IFN-γ to limit dissemination by WNV. Moreover, treatment of primary dendritic cells with IFN-γ reduced WNV production by 130-fold. Collectively, our experiments suggest that the dominant protective role of IFN-γ against WNV is antiviral in nature, occurs in peripheral lymphoid tissues, and prevents viral dissemination to the CNS.

AB  - Partial N-terminal amino acid analyses of five radiolabelled non-structural (ns) proteins specified by Kunjin (KUN) virus provided positive identification of NS3, NS5 and three previously hypothetical ns proteins of flaviviruses, ns2a, ns2b and ns4b. Their correct gene order was obtained from their deduced amino acid sequences. Thus the gene order for KUN virus relative to that proposed for yellow fever (YF) virus was as follows: KUN 5'...GP44.P19.P10.P71.(?).P21.P98-3', YF 5'...NS1.ns2a.ns2b.NS3.ns4a.ns4b.NS5 -3'. The identity of GP44 as NS1 was assumed from the known nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences; ns4a was not identified. The cleavage sites in the polyprotein for KUN NS2B, NS3 and NS5 were identical, Lys-Arg decreased Gly, similar in form to the sequence Arg-Arg decreased Ser defined at the cleavage sites of YF NS3 and NS5. A new consensus cleavage site for NS1, NS2A and NS4B in the form Val-X-Ala decreased, where X is any one of several uncharged amino acids, was found at corresponding sites homologous to those of KUN virus in all published flavivirus sequences (a total of 18 sites). NS1 and NS4B, but not NS2A, were preceded by a putative signal sequence.

TI  - Genetic Interaction of Flavivirus Nonstructural Proteins NS1 and NS4A as a Determinant of Replicase Function
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 73
SP  - 4611
EP  - 4621
AB  - ABSTRACT Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of yellow fever virus (YF) is a glycoprotein localized to extracytoplasmic compartments within infected cells. We have previously shown that NS1 can be supplied intrans and is required for viral RNA replication, a process thought to occur in membrane-bound cytoplasmic complexes. Here we report that the NS1 gene from a related virus, dengue virus (DEN), is unable to function in the process of YF RNA replication. This virus-specific incompatibility leads to a lack of initial minus-strand accumulation, suggesting that DEN NS1 is unable to productively interact with the YF replicase. Based on a YF deletion mutant that requires NS1 in trans, a genetic screen for suppressor mutants was used to select virus variants able to utilize DEN NS1. In three independent selections, a single mutation was mapped to the NS4A gene, which encodes a putative transmembrane replicase component. This mutation, as well as several additional mutations, was engineered into the NS1-deficient genome and confirmed a genetic interaction between NS1 and NS4A. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for integrating NS1 into the cytoplasmic process of RNA replication.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82

AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus methyltransferase catalyzes both guanine N7 and ribose 2′-OH methylations of the viral RNA cap (GpppA-RNA→m7GpppAm-RNA). The methyltransferase is physically linked to an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in the flaviviral NS5 protein. Here, we report genetic interactions of West Nile virus (WNV) methyltransferase with the RdRp and the 5′-terminal stem-loop of viral genomic RNA. Genome-length RNAs, containing amino acid substitutions of D146 (a residue essential for both cap methylations) in the methyltransferase, were transfected into BHK-21 cells. Among the four mutant RNAs (D146L, D146P, D146R, and D146S), only D146S RNA generated viruses in transfected cells. Sequencing of the recovered viruses revealed that, besides the D146S change in the methyltransferase, two classes of compensatory mutations had reproducibly emerged. Class 1 mutations were located in the 5′-terminal stem-loop of the genomic RNA (a G35U substitution or U38 insertion). Class 2 mutations resided in NS5 (K61Q in methyltransferase and W751R in RdRp). Mutagenesis analysis, using a genome-length RNA and a replicon of WNV, demonstrated that the D146S substitution alone was lethal for viral replication; however, the compensatory mutations rescued replication, with the highest rescuing efficiency occurring when both classes of mutations were present. Biochemical analysis showed that a low level of N7 methylation of the D146S methyltransferase is essential for the recovery of adaptive viruses. The methyltransferase K61Q mutation facilitates viral replication through improved N7 methylation activity. The RdRp W751R mutation improves viral replication through an enhanced polymerase activity. Our results have clearly established genetic interactions among flaviviral methyltransferase, RdRp, and the 5′ stem-loop of the genomic RNA.

TI  - Genetic Variants and Susceptibility to Neurological Complications Following West Nile Virus Infection

EP  - 1037
AB  - Abstract To determine genetic factors predisposing to neurological complications following West Nile virus infection, we analyzed a cohort of 560 neuroinvasive case patients and 950 control patients for 13 371 mostly nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The top 3 SNPs on the basis of statistical significance were also in genes of biological plausibility: rs2066786 in RFC1 (replication factor C1) (P = 1.88 × 10−5; odds ratio [OR], 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .56–.81]); rs2298771 in SCN1A (sodium channel, neuronal type I α subunit) (P = 5.87 × 10−5; OR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.21–1.77]); and rs25651 in ANPEP (ananyl aminopeptidase) (P = 1.44 × 10−4; OR, 0.69 [95% CI, .56–.83]). Additional genotyping of these SNPs in a separate sample of 264 case patients and 296 control patients resulted in a lack of significance in the replication cohort; joint significance was as follows: rs2066786, P = .0022; rs2298771, P = .005; rs25651, P = .042. Using mostly nonsynonymous variants, we therefore did not identify genetic variants associated with neuroinvasive disease.

TI  - Genetic Variation in OAS1 Is a Risk Factor for Initial Infection with West Nile Virus in Man
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 5
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a re-emerging pathogen that can cause fatal encephalitis. In mice, susceptibility to WNV has been reported to result from a single point mutation in oas1b, which encodes 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthetase 1b, a member of the type I interferon-regulated OAS gene family involved in viral RNA degradation. In man, the human ortholog of oas1b appears to be OAS1. The ‘A’ allele at SNP rs10774671 of OAS1 has previously been shown to alter splicing of OAS1 and to be associated with reduced OAS activity in PBMCs. Here we show that the frequency of this hypofunctional allele is increased in both symptomatic and asymptomatic WNV seroconverters (Caucasians from five US centers; total n = 501; OR = 1.6 [95% CI 1.2–2.0], P = 0.0002 in a recessive genetic model). We then directly tested the effect of this SNP on viral replication in a novel ex vivo model of WNV infection in primary human lymphoid tissue. Virus accumulation varied markedly among donors, and was highest for individuals homozygous for the ‘A’ allele (P<0.0001). Together, these data identify OAS1 SNP rs10774671 as a host genetic risk factor for initial infection with WNV in humans.

JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases

EP  - 5
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) causes disease in approximately 20% of infected humans. We previously reported that homozygosity for CCR5Delta32, a nonfunctional variant of chemokine receptor CCR5, is markedly increased among symptomatic WNV-seropositive patients from Arizona and Colorado. To confirm this, we analyzed cohorts from California and Illinois. An increase in CCR5-deficient subjects was found in both (for California, odds ratio [OR], 4.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.5-11.9] [P= .004]; for Illinois, OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 0.9-11.2] [P= .06]). A meta-analysis of all 4 cohorts showed an OR of 4.2 (95% CI, 2.1-8.3 [P= .0001]). Thus, CCR5 deficiency is a strong and consistent risk factor for symptomatic WNV infection in the United States.

AB  - SUMMARY The epidemiology of West Nile virus (WNV) in Israel is different from other neighbouring countries in the Middle East where disease burden has been minimal. We analysed a cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish patients with symptomatic WNV infection (n = 39), and WNV-negative controls (n = 61), for nine genetic variants that has been suggested to be associated with susceptibility to WNV. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms were significantly more frequent in WNV-infected than non-infected individuals, rs7280422 (MX1) [odds ratio (OR) 4·05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2·04–8·03, P < 0·001] and rs3213545 (OASL) (OR 1·85, 95% CI 1·03–3·3, P = 0·03). Genetic polymorphism may play a significant role in susceptibility to WNV infection in Ashkenazi Jews

JF  - The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene
VL  - 33 4
SP  - 715
EP  - 24
AB  - Mutant and geographical strains of Culex tritaeniorhynchus were compared for West Nile (WN) virus susceptibility by feeding on a high-titered blood-virus suspension. Eleven strains also were selected from 2-21 generations for an increase and/or a reduction of oral susceptibility using 90% and 10% infective virus doses, respectively. Only one of the 20 strains tested, e ma, was significantly less susceptible than the control strain. In the selection experiments, none of the strains showed a consistent decrease in susceptibility, but the Changa Manga II (CM) strain showed a sustained increase in susceptibility from generations F11-F21 when selection was discontinued. Reciprocal cross-matings and back-crosses were set up between the selected CM strain and two of the morphological mutant strains, e ma and re e ae, carrying homozygous recessive markers. The resulting progeny were tested for susceptibility to WN virus infection and the ability to replicate virus to high-titers after infection. These results suggest that the trait of increased susceptibility is dominant over resistance. The enhanced ability of infected mosquitoes to replicate WN virus showed partial dominance. Both of these traits appear to be polyfactorial, and are apparently associated with more than one chromosome in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus.

TI  - Genome-Wide CRISPR Screen Identifies RACK1 as a Critical Host Factor for Flavivirus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Cellular factors are critical in all facets of viral lifecycles, where overlapping interactions between the virus and host can be exploited as possible avenues for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Using a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening approach to identify novel cellular factors important for flavivirus replication we identified RACK1 as a pro-viral host factor for both mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2. ABSTRACT Cellular factors have important roles in all facets of the flavivirus replication cycle. Deciphering viral-host protein interactions is essential for understanding the flavivirus life cycle as well as development of effective antiviral strategies. To uncover novel host factors that are co-opted by multiple flaviviruses, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome wide knockout (KO) screen was employed to identify genes required for replication of Zika virus (ZIKV). Receptor for Activated Protein C Kinase 1 (RACK1) was identified as a novel host factor required for ZIKV replication, which was confirmed via complementary experiments. Depletion of RACK1 via siRNA demonstrated that RACK1 is important for replication of a wide range of mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses, including West Nile Virus (WNV), Dengue Virus (DENV), Powassan Virus (POWV) and Langat Virus (LGTV) as well as the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, but not for YFV, EBOV, VSV or HSV. Notably, flavivirus replication was only abrogated when RACK1 expression was dampened prior to infection. Utilising a non-replicative flavivirus model, we show altered morphology of viral replication factories and reduced formation of vesicle packets (VPs) in cells lacking RACK1 expression. In addition, RACK1 interacted with NS1 protein from multiple flaviviruses; a key protein for replication complex formation. Overall, these findings reveal RACK1’s crucial role to the biogenesis of pan-flavivirus replication organelles. IMPORTANCE Cellular factors are critical in all facets of viral lifecycles, where overlapping interactions between the virus and host can be exploited as possible avenues for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Using a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening approach to identify novel cellular factors important for flavivirus replication we identified RACK1 as a pro-viral host factor for both mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2. Using an innovative flavivirus protein expression system, we demonstrate for the first time the impact of the loss of RACK1 on the formation of viral replication factories known as 'vesicle packets' (VPs). In addition, we show that RACK1 can interact with numerous flavivirus NS1 proteins as a potential mechanism by which VP formation can be induced by the former.

TI  - Genome-Wide RNAi Screen Identifies Broadly-Acting Host Factors That Inhibit Arbovirus Infection
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 10
AB  - Vector-borne viruses are an important class of emerging and re-emerging pathogens; thus, an improved understanding of the cellular factors that modulate infection in their respective vertebrate and insect hosts may aid control efforts. In particular, cell-intrinsic antiviral pathways restrict vector-borne viruses including the type I interferon response in vertebrates and the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in insects. However, it is likely that additional cell-intrinsic mechanisms exist to limit these viruses. Since insects rely on innate immune mechanisms to inhibit virus infections, we used Drosophila as a model insect to identify cellular factors that restrict West Nile virus (WNV), a flavivirus with a broad and expanding geographical host range. Our genome-wide RNAi screen identified 50 genes that inhibited WNV infection. Further screening revealed that 17 of these genes were antiviral against additional flaviviruses, and seven of these were antiviral against other vector-borne viruses, expanding our knowledge of invertebrate cell-intrinsic immunity. Investigation of two newly identified factors that restrict diverse viruses, dXPO1 and dRUVBL1, in the Tip60 complex, demonstrated they contributed to antiviral defense at the organismal level in adult flies, in mosquito cells, and in mammalian cells. These data suggest the existence of broadly acting and functionally conserved antiviral genes and pathways that restrict virus infections in evolutionarily divergent hosts.

TI  - Helicase Domain of West Nile Virus NS3 Protein Plays a Role in Inhibition of Type I Interferon Signalling
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 9
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus that can cause encephalitis in mammalian and avian hosts. In America, the virulent WNV strain (NY99) is causing yearly outbreaks of encephalitis in humans and horses, while in Australia the less virulent Kunjin strain of WNV strain has not been associated with significant disease outbreaks until a recent 2011 large outbreak in horses (but not in humans) caused by NSW2011 strain. Using chimeric viruses between NY99 and NSW2011 strains we previously identified a role for the non-structural proteins of NY99 strain and especially the NS3 protein, in enhanced virus replication in type I interferon response-competent cells and increased virulence in mice. To further define the role of NY99 NS3 protein in inhibition of type I interferon response, we have generated and characterised additional chimeric viruses containing the protease or the helicase domains of NY99 NS3 on the background of the NSW2011 strain. The results identified the role for the helicase but not the protease domain of NS3 protein in the inhibition of type I interferon signalling and showed that helicase domain of the more virulent NY99 strain performs this function more efficiently than helicase domain of the less virulent NSW2011 strain. Further analysis with individual amino acid mutants identified two amino acid residues in the helicase domain primarily responsible for this difference. Using chimeric replicons, we also showed that the inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) signalling was independent of other known functions of NS3 in RNA replication and assembly of virus particles.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83
SP  - 5581
EP  - 5591
AB  - ABSTRACT The internal hydrophobic sequence within the flaviviral capsid protein (protein C) plays an important role in the assembly of infectious virions. Here, this sequence was analyzed in a West Nile virus lineage I isolate (crow V76/1). An infectious cDNA clone was constructed and used to introduce deletions into the internal hydrophobic domain which comprises helix α2 and part of the loop intervening helices α2 and α3. In total, nine capsid deletion mutants (4 to 14 amino acids long) were constructed and tested for virus viability. Some of the short deletions did not significantly affect growth in cell culture, whereas larger deletions removing almost the entire hydrophobic region significantly impaired viral growth. Efficient growth of the majority of mutants could, however, be restored by the acquisition of second-site mutations. In most cases, these resuscitating mutations were point mutations within protein C changing individual amino acids into more hydrophobic residues, reminiscent of what had been observed previously for another flavivirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus. However, we also identified viable spontaneous pseudorevertants with more than one-third of the capsid protein removed, i.e., 36 or 37 of a total of 105 residues, including all of helix α3 and a hydrophilic segment connecting α3 and α4. These large deletions are predicted to induce formation of large, predominantly hydrophobic fusion helices which may substitute for the loss of the internal hydrophobic domain, underlining the unrivaled structural and functional flexibility of protein C.

TI  - Homologs of Human Dengue-Resistance Genes, FKBP1B and ATCAY, Confer Antiviral Resistance in Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes
JF  - Insects
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted by mosquitoes and is a major public health concern. The study of innate mosquito defense mechanisms against DENV have revealed crucial roles for the Toll, Imd, JAK-STAT, and RNAi pathways in mediating DENV in the mosquito. Often overlooked in such studies is the role of intrinsic cellular defense mechanisms that we hypothesize to work in concert with the classical immune pathways to affect organismal defense. Our understanding of the molecular interaction of DENV with mosquito host cells is limited, and we propose to expand upon the recent results from a genome-scale, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based study that identified mammalian host proteins associated with resistance to dengue/West Nile virus (DENV/WNV) infection. The study identified 22 human DENV/WNV resistance genes (DVR), and we hypothesized that a subset would be functionally conserved in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, imparting cellular defense against flaviviruses in this species. We identified 12 homologs of 22 human DVR genes in the Ae. aegypti genome. To evaluate their possible role in cellular resistance/antiviral defense against DENV, we used siRNA silencing targeted against each of the 12 homologs in an Ae. aegypti cell line (Aag2) infected with DENV2 and identified that silencing of the two candidates, AeFKBP1 and AeATCAY, homologs of human FKBP1B and ATCAY, were associated with a viral increase. We then used dsRNA to silence each of the two genes in adult mosquitoes to validate the observed antiviral functions in vivo. Depletion of AeFKBP1 or AeATCAY increased viral dissemination through the mosquito at 14 days post-infection. Our results demonstrated that AeFKBP1 and AeATCAY mediate resistance to DENV akin to what has been described for their homologs in humans. AeFKBP1 and AeATCAY provide a rare opportunity to elucidate a DENV-resistance mechanism that may be evolutionarily conserved between humans and Ae. aegypti.

TI  - Host Factors Involved in West Nile Virus Replication
JF  - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
VL  - 951
AB  - Abstract: Viruses use cell proteins during many stages of their replication cycles, including attachment, entry, translation, transcription/replication, and assembly. Mutations in the cell proteins involved can cause disruptions of these critical host‐virus interactions, which in turn can affect the efficiency of virus replication. These host‐virus interactions also represent novel targets for the development of new antiviral agents. The different alleles of the murine Flv gene confer resistance or susceptibility to flavivirus‐induced disease and provide a natural mutant system for the study of a host protein that can alter the outcome of a flavivirus infection. Since flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus, replicate in mosquitoes, mammals, and birds during their natural transmission cycles, it is expected that the critical cell proteins used by these viruses will be ones that are highly conserved between divergent host species. Our laboratory has focused on the identification and characterization of the flavivirus resistance gene product and of cell proteins that interact with the 3′ terminal regions of the West Nile virus genomic and antigenomic RNAs. The 3′ terminal regions of the viral RNAs function as promotors for viral RNA replication. Cell proteins that bind to the viral 3′ RNAs were detected by gel shift and UV‐induced cross‐linking assays. Individual proteins were then purified and partially sequenced. Mutation of a mapped, protein‐binding site within the 3′ terminal region of the viral RNA in an infectious West Nile virus clone was used to demonstrate the functional importance of one of the cell proteins for efficient West Nile virus replication. Data from additional studies suggested possible roles for this viral RNA‐cell protein interaction during the flavivirus replication cycle.

AB  - Recent field studies have suggested that the dynamics of West Nile virus (WNV) transmission are influenced strongly by a few key super spreader bird species that function both as primary blood hosts of the vector mosquitoes (in particular Culex pipiens) and as reservoir-competent virus hosts. It has been hypothesized that human cases result from a shift in mosquito feeding from these key bird species to humans after abundance of the key birds species decreases. To test this paradigm, we performed a mosquito blood meal analysis integrating host-feeding patterns of Cx. pipiens, the principal vector of WNV in the eastern United States north of the latitude 36 degrees N and other mosquito species with robust measures of host availability, to determine host selection in a WNV-endemic area of suburban Chicago, Illinois, during 2005-2007. Results showed that Cx. pipiens fed predominantly (83%) on birds with a high diversity of species used as hosts (25 species). American robins (Turdus migratorius) were marginally overused and several species were underused on the basis of relative abundance measures, including the common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), and European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). Culex pipiens also fed substantially on mammals (19%; 7 species with humans representing 16%). West Nile virus transmission intensified in July of both years at times when American robins were heavily fed upon, and then decreased when robin abundance decreased, after which other birds species were selected as hosts. There was no shift in feeding from birds to mammals coincident with emergence of human cases. Rather, bird feeding predominated when the onset of the human cases occurred. Measures of host abundance and competence and Cx. pipiens feeding preference were combined to estimate the amplification fractions of the different bird species. Predictions were that approximately 66% of WNV-infectious Cx. pipiens became infected from feeding on just a few species of birds, including American robins (35%), blue jays (17%, Cyanocitta cristata), and house finches (15%, Carpodacus mexicanus).

VL  - 57

EP  - 432
AB  - Flaviviruses, such as the dengue virus and the West Nile virus (WNV), are arthropod-borne viruses that represent a global health problem. The flavivirus lifecycle is intimately connected to cellular lipids. Among the lipids co-opted by flaviviruses, we have focused on SM, an important component of cellular membranes particularly enriched in the nervous system. After infection with the neurotropic WNV, mice deficient in acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), which accumulate high levels of SM in their tissues, displayed exacerbated infection. In addition, WNV multiplication was enhanced in cells from human patients with Niemann-Pick type A, a disease caused by a deficiency of ASM activity resulting in SM accumulation. Furthermore, the addition of SM to cultured cells also increased WNV infection, whereas treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of SM synthesis reduced WNV infection. Confocal microscopy analyses confirmed the association of SM with viral replication sites within infected cells. Our results unveil that SM metabolism regulates flavivirus infection in vivo and propose SM as a suitable target for antiviral design against WNV.

TI  - Human MicroRNA miR-532-5p Exhibits Antiviral Activity against West Nile Virus via Suppression of Host Genes SESTD1 and TAB3 Required for Virus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 2388
EP  - 2402
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that naturally circulates between mosquitos and birds but can also infect humans, causing severe neurological disease. The early host response to WNV infection in vertebrates primarily relies on the type I interferon pathway; however, recent studies suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs) may also play a notable role. In this study, we assessed the role of host miRNAs in response to WNV infection in human cells. We employed small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to determine changes in the expression of host miRNAs in HEK293 cells infected with an Australian strain of WNV, Kunjin (WNVKUN), and identified a number of host miRNAs differentially expressed in response to infection. Three of these miRNAs were confirmed to be significantly upregulated in infected cells by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR and Northern blot analyses, and one of them, miR-532-5p, exhibited a significant antiviral effect against WNVKUN infection. We have demonstrated that miR-532-5p targets and downregulates expression of the host genes SESTD1 and TAB3 in human cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) depletion studies showed that both SESTD1 and TAB3 were required for efficient WNVKUN replication. We also demonstrated upregulation of mir-532-5p expression and a corresponding decrease in the expression of its targets, SESTD1 and TAB3, in the brains of WNVKUN -infected mice. Our results show that upregulation of miR-532-5p and subsequent suppression of the SESTD1 and TAB3 genes represent a host antiviral response aimed at limiting WNVKUN infection and highlight the important role of miRNAs in controlling RNA virus infections in mammalian hosts. IMPORTANCE West Nile virus (WNV) is a significant viral pathogen that poses a considerable threat to human health across the globe. There is no specific treatment or licensed vaccine available for WNV, and deeper insight into how the virus interacts with the host is required to facilitate their development. In this study, we addressed the role of host microRNAs (miRNAs) in antiviral response to WNV in human cells. We identified miR-532-5p as a novel antiviral miRNA and showed that it is upregulated in response to WNV infection and suppresses the expression of the host genes TAB3 and SESTD1 required for WNV replication. Our results show that upregulation of miR-532-5p and subsequent suppression of the SESTD1 and TAB3 genes represent an antiviral response aimed at limiting WNV infection and highlight the important role of miRNAs in controlling virus infections in mammalian hosts.

TI  - Human Sec3 protein is a novel transcriptional and translational repressor of flavivirus
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - The Flaviviridae family consists of several medically important pathogens such as West Nile virus (WNV) and Dengue virus (DENV). Flavivirus capsid (C) protein is a key structural component of virus particles. However, the role of C protein in the pathogenesis of arthropod‐borne flaviviruses is poorly understood. To examine whether flavivirus C protein can associate with cellular proteins, and contribute to viral pathogenesis, WNV/DENV C protein was screened against a human brain/liver cDNA yeast two‐hybrid library. This study identified human Sec3 exocyst protein (hSec3p) as a novel interacting partner of WNV and DENV C protein. Mutagenesis studies showed that the SH2 domain‐binding motif of hSec3p binds to the first 15 amino acids of C protein. We report for the first time that hSec3p can modulate virus production by affecting viral RNA transcription and translation through the sequestration of elongation factor 1α (EF1α). This molecular discovery shed light on the protective role of hSec3p during flavivirus infection. This study also highlighted the antagonistic mechanism adopted by flavivirus C protein that can negatively regulate the formation of hSec3p–EF1α complex by sequestering hSec3p to establish successful infection.

TI  - ICAM-1 Participates in the Entry of West Nile Virus into the Central Nervous System
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 4164
EP  - 4168
AB  - ABSTRACT Determining how West Nile virus crosses the blood-brain barrier is critical to understanding the pathogenesis of encephalitis. Here, we show that ICAM-1−/− mice are more resistant than control animals to lethal West Nile encephalitis. ICAM-1−/− mice have a lower viral load, reduced leukocyte infiltration, and diminished neuronal damage in the brain compared to control animals. This is associated with decreased blood-brain barrier leakage after viral infection. These data suggest that ICAM-1 plays an important role in West Nile virus neuroinvasion and that targeting ICAM-1 signaling may help control viral encephalitis.

TI  - IFN-Dependent and -Independent Reduction in West Nile Virus Infectivity in Human Dermal Fibroblasts
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 6
SP  - 1424
EP  - 1441
AB  - Although dermal fibroblasts are one of the first cell types exposed to West Nile virus (WNV) during a blood meal by an infected mosquito, little is known about WNV replication within this cell type. Here, we demonstrate that neuroinvasive, WNV-New York (WNV-NY), and nonneuroinvasive, WNV-Australia (WNV-AUS60) strains are able to infect and replicate in primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). However, WNV-AUS60 replication and spread within HDFs was reduced compared to that of WNV-NY due to an interferon (IFN)-independent reduction in viral infectivity early in infection. Additionally, replication of both strains was constrained late in infection by an IFN-β-dependent reduction in particle infectivity. Overall, our data indicates that human dermal fibroblasts are capable of supporting WNV replication; however, the low infectivity of particles produced from HDFs late in infection suggests that this cell type likely plays a limited role as a viral reservoir in vivo.

TI  - IL-10 Signaling Blockade Controls Murine West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 5
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne single-stranded RNA flavivirus, can cause significant human morbidity and mortality. Our data show that interleukin-10 (IL-10) is dramatically elevated both in vitro and in vivo following WNV infection. Consistent with an etiologic role of IL-10 in WNV pathogenesis, we find that WNV infection is markedly diminished in IL-10 deficient (IL-10−/−) mice, and pharmacologic blockade of IL-10 signaling by IL-10 neutralizing antibody increases survival of WNV-infected mice. Increased production of antiviral cytokines in IL-10−/− mice is associated with more efficient control of WNV infection. Moreover, CD4+ T cells produce copious amounts of IL-10, and may be an important cellular source of IL-10 during WNV infection in vivo. In conclusion, IL-10 signaling plays a negative role in immunity against WNV infection, and blockade of IL-10 signaling by genetic or pharmacologic means helps to control viral infection, suggesting a novel anti-WNV therapeutic strategy.

TI  - IL-1β Signaling Promotes CNS-Intrinsic Immune Control of West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 8
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging flavivirus capable of infecting the central nervous system (CNS) and mediating neuronal cell death and tissue destruction. The processes that promote inflammation and encephalitis within the CNS are important for control of WNV disease but, how inflammatory signaling pathways operate to control CNS infection is not defined. Here, we identify IL-1β signaling and the NLRP3 inflammasome as key host restriction factors involved in viral control and CNS disease associated with WNV infection. Individuals presenting with acute WNV infection displayed elevated levels of IL-1β in their plasma over the course of infection, suggesting a role for IL-1β in WNV immunity. Indeed, we found that in a mouse model of infection, WNV induced the acute production of IL-1β in vivo, and that animals lacking the IL-1 receptor or components involved in inflammasome signaling complex exhibited increased susceptibility to WNV pathogenesis. This outcome associated with increased accumulation of virus within the CNS but not peripheral tissues and was further associated with altered kinetics and magnitude of inflammation, reduced quality of the effector CD8+ T cell response and reduced anti-viral activity within the CNS. Importantly, we found that WNV infection triggers production of IL-1β from cortical neurons. Furthermore, we found that IL-1β signaling synergizes with type I IFN to suppress WNV replication in neurons, thus implicating antiviral activity of IL-1β within neurons and control of virus replication within the CNS. Our studies thus define the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and IL-1β signaling as key features controlling WNV infection and immunity in the CNS, and reveal a novel role for IL-1β in antiviral action that restricts virus replication in neurons.

TI  - IPS-1 Is Essential for the Control of West Nile Virus Infection and Immunity
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 6
AB  - The innate immune response is essential for controlling West Nile virus (WNV) infection but how this response is propagated and regulates adaptive immunity in vivo are not defined. Herein, we show that IPS-1, the central adaptor protein to RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling, is essential for triggering of innate immunity and for effective development and regulation of adaptive immunity against pathogenic WNV. IPS-1−/− mice exhibited increased susceptibility to WNV infection marked by enhanced viral replication and dissemination with early viral entry into the CNS. Infection of cultured bone-marrow (BM) derived dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages (Macs), and primary cortical neurons showed that the IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling was essential for triggering IFN defenses and controlling virus replication in these key target cells of infection. Intriguingly, infected IPS-1−/− mice displayed uncontrolled inflammation that included elevated systemic type I IFN, proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses, increased numbers of inflammatory DCs, enhanced humoral responses marked by complete loss of virus neutralization activity, and increased numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and non-specific immune cell proliferation in the periphery and in the CNS. This uncontrolled inflammatory response was associated with a lack of regulatory T cell expansion that normally occurs during acute WNV infection. Thus, the enhanced inflammatory response in the absence of IPS-1 was coupled with a failure to protect against WNV infection. Our data define an innate/adaptive immune interface mediated through IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling that regulates the quantity, quality, and balance of the immune response to WNV infection.

TI  - ISG15 facilitates cellular antiviral response to dengue and west nile virus infection in vitro
AB  - BackgroundDengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV), close siblings of the Flaviviridae family, are the causative agents of Dengue hemorraghic shock or West Nile meningoencephalitis respectively. Vaccines against these two flaviviruses are currently unavailable. Interferon- Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), encoding an ubiquitin-like protein, is significantly induced by type I interferons or viral infections. Its roles in viral infections, however, vary with viruses, being either anti- or pro-viral. The exact roles of ISG15 in DENV and WNV infections remain unknown. In the current study, we evaluated the relevancies of ISG15 to DENV and WNV infection of a mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7.FindingsQuantitative PCR showed that mouse Isg15 was dramatically induced in DENV or WNV- infected RAW264.7 cells compared with non-infected cells. Isg15 and two other Jak-Stat related genes, Socs1 and Socs3, were silenced using siRNA mediated RNA interference. The intracellular DENV and WNV loads, as determined by quantitative PCR, were significantly higher in Isg15 silenced cells than control cells. The expression levels of interferon beta 1 (Ifnb1) were increased significantly in Isg15, Socs1 or Socs3 siRNA treated cells. Further investigation indicated that protein modification by ISG15, so called ISGylation, was significantly enhanced in DENV-infected cells compared to that in non-infected cells.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that ISG15 plays an anti-DENV/WNV function via protein ISGylation.

TI  - Identification and Characterization of the Host Protein DNAJC14 as a Broadly Active Flavivirus Replication Modulator
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 7
AB  - Viruses in the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family are arthropod-transmitted and contribute to staggering numbers of human infections and significant deaths annually across the globe. To identify cellular factors with antiviral activity against flaviviruses, we screened a cDNA library using an iterative approach. We identified a mammalian Hsp40 chaperone protein (DNAJC14) that when overexpressed was able to mediate protection from yellow fever virus (YFV)-induced cell death. Further studies revealed that DNAJC14 inhibits YFV at the step of viral RNA replication. Since replication of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a member of the related Pestivirus genus, is also known to be modulated by DNAJC14, we tested the effect of this host factor on diverse Flaviviridae family members. Flaviviruses, including the pathogenic Asibi strain of YFV, Kunjin, and tick-borne Langat virus, as well as a Hepacivirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), all were inhibited by overexpression of DNAJC14. Mutagenesis showed that both the J-domain and the C-terminal domain, which mediates self-interaction, are required for anti-YFV activity. We found that DNAJC14 does not block YFV nor HCV NS2-3 cleavage, and using non-inhibitory mutants demonstrate that DNAJC14 is recruited to YFV replication complexes. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that endogenous DNAJC14 rearranges during infection and is found in replication complexes identified by dsRNA staining. Interestingly, silencing of endogenous DNAJC14 results in impaired YFV replication suggesting a requirement for DNAJC14 in YFV replication complex assembly. Finally, the antiviral activity of overexpressed DNAJC14 occurs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. DNAJC14 overexpression may disrupt the proper stoichiometry resulting in inhibition, which can be overcome upon restoration of the optimal ratios due to the accumulation of viral nonstructural proteins. Our findings, together with previously published work, suggest that the members of the Flaviviridae family have evolved in unique and important ways to interact with this host Hsp40 chaperone molecule.

TI  - Identification of Cellular Proteome Modifications in Response to West Nile Virus Infection*

VL  - 8
SP  - 1623
EP  - 1637
AB  - Flaviviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses that are a public health problem because of their widespread distribution and their ability to cause a variety of diseases in humans. West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne member of this genus and is the etiologic agent of West Nile encephalitis. Clinical manifestations of West Nile virus infection are diverse, and their pathogenic mechanisms depend on complex virus-cell interactions. In the present work, we used proteomics technology to analyze early Vero cell response to West Nile infection. The differential proteomes were resolved 24 h postinfection using two-dimensional DIGE followed by mass spectrometry identification. Quantitative analysis (at least 2-fold quantitative alteration, p < 0.05) revealed 127 differentially expressed proteins with 68 up-regulated proteins and 59 down-regulated proteins of which 93 were successfully identified. The implication for mammalian cellular responses to this neurotropic flavivirus infection was analyzed and made possible more comprehensive characterization of the virus-host interactions involved in pathogenesis. The present study thus provides large scale protein-related information that should be useful for understanding how the host metabolism is modified by West Nile infection and for identifying new potential targets for antiviral therapy.

AB  - Flaviviruses such as Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV) are major global pathogens for which safe and effective antiviral therapies are not currently available. To identify antiviral small molecules with well-characterized safety and bioavailability profiles, we screened a library of 2,907 approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds for inhibitors of ZIKV infection using a high-throughput cell-based immunofluorescence assay. Interestingly, estrogen receptor modulators raloxifene hydrochloride and quinestrol were among 15 compounds that significantly inhibited ZIKV infection in repeat screens. ABSTRACT Flaviviruses such as Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV) are major global pathogens for which safe and effective antiviral therapies are not currently available. To identify antiviral small molecules with well-characterized safety and bioavailability profiles, we screened a library of 2,907 approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds for inhibitors of ZIKV infection using a high-throughput cell-based immunofluorescence assay. Interestingly, estrogen receptor modulators raloxifene hydrochloride and quinestrol were among 15 compounds that significantly inhibited ZIKV infection in repeat screens. Subsequent validation studies revealed that these drugs effectively inhibit ZIKV, DENV, and WNV (Kunjin strain) infection at low micromolar concentrations with minimal cytotoxicity in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells and HTR-8 placental trophoblast cells. Since these cells lack detectable expression of estrogen receptors-α and -β (ER-α and ER-β) and similar antiviral effects were observed in the context of subgenomic DENV and ZIKV replicons, these compounds appear to inhibit viral RNA replication in a manner that is independent of their known effects on estrogen receptor signaling. Taken together, quinestrol, raloxifene hydrochloride, and structurally related analogues warrant further investigation as potential therapeutics for treatment of flavivirus infections.

AB  - ABSTRACT Interferons (IFNs) are key mediators of the host innate antiviral immune response. To identify IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that instigate an antiviral state against two medically important flaviviruses, West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV), we tested 36 ISGs that are commonly induced by IFN-α for antiviral activity against the two viruses. We discovered that five ISGs efficiently suppressed WNV and/or DENV infection when they were individually expressed in HEK293 cells. Mechanistic analyses revealed that two structurally related cell plasma membrane proteins, IFITM2 and IFITM3, disrupted early steps (entry and/or uncoating) of the viral infection. In contrast, three IFN-induced cellular enzymes, viperin, ISG20, and double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase, inhibited steps in viral proteins and/or RNA biosynthesis. Our results thus imply that the antiviral activity of IFN-α is collectively mediated by a panel of ISGs that disrupt multiple steps of the DENV and WNV life cycles.

TI  - Identification of Genes Critical for Resistance to Infection by West Nile Virus Using RNA-Seq Analysis

EP  - 1681
AB  - The West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging infection of biodefense concern and there are no available treatments or vaccines. Here we used a high-throughput method based on a novel gene expression analysis, RNA-Seq, to give a global picture of differential gene expression by primary human macrophages of 10 healthy donors infected in vitro with WNV. From a total of 28 million reads per sample, we identified 1,514 transcripts that were differentially expressed after infection. Both predicted and novel gene changes were detected, as were gene isoforms, and while many of the genes were expressed by all donors, some were unique. Knock-down of genes not previously known to be associated with WNV resistance identified their critical role in control of viral infection. Our study distinguishes both common gene pathways as well as novel cellular responses. Such analyses will be valuable for translational studies of susceptible and resistant individuals—and for targeting therapeutics—in multiple biological settings.

AB  - Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression during important biological processes including development and pathogen defense in most living organisms. Presently, no miRNAs have been identified in the mosquito Culex tarsalis (Diptera: Culicidae), one of the most important vectors of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America. We used small RNA sequencing data and in vitro and in vivo experiments to identify and validate a repertoire of miRNAs in Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes. Using bioinformatic approaches we analyzed small RNA sequences from the Cx. tarsalis CT embryonic cell line to discover orthologs for 86 miRNAs. Consistent with other mosquitoes such as Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus, miR-184 was found to be the most abundant miRNA in Cx. tarsalis. We also identified 20 novel miRNAs from the recently sequenced Cx. tarsalis genome, for a total of 106 miRNAs identified in this study. The presence of selected miRNAs was biologically validated in both the CT cell line and in adult Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes using RT–qPCR and sequencing. These results will open new avenues of research into the role of miRNAs in Cx. tarsalis biology, including development, metabolism, immunity, and pathogen infection.

TI  - Identification of Residues Critical for the Interferon Antagonist Function of Langat Virus NS5 Reveals a Role for the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Domain
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 6936
EP  - 6946
AB  - ABSTRACT All pathogenic flaviviruses examined thus far inhibit host interferon (IFN) responses by suppressing the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. Both Langat virus (LGTV; a member of the tick-borne encephalitis virus serogroup) and Japanese encephalitis virus use the nonstructural protein NS5 to suppress JAK-STAT signaling. However, NS5 is also critical to virus replication, contributing methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activities. The specific amino acid residues of NS5 involved in IFN antagonism are not known. Here, we demonstrate that the LGTV NS5 JAK-STAT inhibitory domain is contained between amino acids 355 and 735 (of 903), a range which lies within the RdRP domain. Furthermore, we identified two noncontiguous stretches of specific amino acids within the RdRP, 374 to 380 and 624 to 647, as critical for inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling. Despite considerable separation on the linear NS5 sequence, these residues localized adjacent to each other when modeled on the West Nile virus RdRP crystal structure. Due to the general conservation of RdRP structures, these results suggest that the specific residues identified act cooperatively to form a unique functional site on the RdRP responsible for JAK-STAT inhibition. This insight into the mechanism underlying flavivirus IFN evasion strategies will facilitate the design of antiviral therapeutics that potentiate the action of IFN during infection.

TI  - Identification of cis-Acting Nucleotides and a Structural Feature in West Nile Virus 3′-Terminus RNA That Facilitate Viral Minus Strand RNA Synthesis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 7622
EP  - 7636
AB  - ABSTRACT The 3′-terminal nucleotides (nt) of West Nile virus (WNV) genomic RNA form a penultimate 16-nt small stem-loop (SSL) and an 80-nt terminal stem-loop (SL). These RNA structures are conserved in divergent flavivirus genomes. A previous in vitro study using truncated WNV 3′ RNA structures predicted a putative tertiary interaction between the 5′ side of the 3′-terminal SL and the loop of the SSL. Although substitution or deletion of the 3′ G (nt 87) within the SSL loop, which forms the only G-C pair in the predicted tertiary interaction, in a WNV infectious clone was lethal, a finding consistent with the involvement in a functionally relevant pseudoknot interaction, extensive mutagenesis of nucleotides in the terminal SL did not identify a cis-acting pairing partner for this SSL 3′ G. However, both the sequence and the structural context of two adjacent base pairs flanked by symmetrical internal loops in the 3′-terminal SL were shown to be required for efficient viral RNA replication. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis confirmed the predicted SSL and SL structures but not the tertiary interaction. The SSL was previously reported to contain one of three eEF1A binding sites, and G87 in the SSL loop was shown to be involved in eEF1A binding. The nucleotides at the bottom part of the 3′-terminal SL switch between 3′ RNA-RNA and 3′-5′ RNA-RNA interactions. The data suggest that interaction of the 3′ SL RNA with eEF1A at three sites and a unique metastable structural feature may participate in regulating structural changes in the 3′-terminal SL.

TI  - Identification of conserved motifs in the Westnile virus envelope essential for particle secretion
JF  - BMC Microbiology
VL  - 13
SP  - 197
EP  - 197
AB  - Enveloped viruses utilize cellular membranes to bud from infected cells. The process of virion assembly and budding is often facilitated by the presence of certain conserved motifs within viral proteins in conjunction with cellular factors. We hence examined the West Nile Virus (WNV) Envelope protein for the presence of any such motifs and their functional characterization. We identified conserved 461PXAP464 and 349YCYL352 motifs in the WNV envelope glycoprotein bearing resemblance to retroviral late domains. Disruptive mutations of PXAP to LAAL and of the highly conserved Cys350 in the YCYL motif, led to a severe reduction in WNV particle production. Similar motifs in case of retroviruses are known to interact with components of host sorting machinery like PXAP with Tsg101 and YXXL with Alix. However, in the case of WNV, siRNA mediated depletion of Alix or Tsg101 did not have an effect on WNV release. Molecular modeling suggested that while the 461PXAP464 motif is surface accessible and could potentially interact with cellular proteins required for WNV assembly, the 349YCYL352 motif was found to be internal with Cys350 important for protein folding via disulphide bonding. The conserved 461PXAP464 and 349YCYL352 motifs in the WNV envelope are indispensable for WNV particle production. Although these motifs bear sequence similarity to retroviral late domains and are essential for WNV assembly, they are functionally distinct suggesting that they are not the typical late domain like motifs of retroviruses and may play a role other than Alix/Tsg101 utilization/dependence.

TI  - Identification of genetic variants associated with dengue or West Nile virus disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis
JF  - BMC Infectious Diseases
VL  - 18
AB  - BackgroundDengue and West Nile viruses are highly cross-reactive and have numerous parallels in geography, potential vector host (Aedes family of mosquitoes), and initial symptoms of infection. While the vast majority (> 80%) of both dengue and West Nile virus infections result in asymptomatic infections, a minority of individuals experience symptomatic infection and an even smaller proportion develop severe disease. The mechanisms by which these infections lead to severe disease in a subset of infected individuals is incompletely understood, but individual host differences including genetic factors and immune responses have been proposed. We sought to identify genetic risk factors that are associated with more severe disease outcomes for both viruses in order to shed light on possible shared mechanisms of resistance and potential therapeutic interventions.MethodsWe applied a search strategy using four major databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Global Health) to find all known genetic associations identified to date with dengue or West Nile virus disease. Here we present a review of our findings and a meta-analysis of genetic variants identified.ResultsWe found genetic variations that are significantly associated with infections of these viruses. In particular we found variation within the OAS1 (meta-OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.69–1.00) and CCR5 (meta-OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.08–1.53) genes is significantly associated with West Nile virus disease, while variation within MICB (meta-OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.68–3.29), PLCE1 (meta-OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.42–0.71), MBL2 (meta-OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.02–2.31), and IFN-γ (meta-OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.30–4.71), is associated with dengue disease.ConclusionsDespite substantial heterogeneity in populations studied, genes examined, and methodology, significant associations with genetic variants were found across studies within both diseases. These gene associations suggest a key role for immune mechanisms in susceptibility to severe disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of these genes in disease pathogenesis and may reveal additional genetic factors associated with disease severity.

JF  - Genes and immunity
VL  - 17

EP  - 304
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) infection results in a diverse spectrum of outcomes, and host genetics are likely to influence susceptibility to neuroinvasive disease (West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND)). We performed whole-exome sequencing of 44 individuals with WNND and identified alleles associated with severe disease by variant filtration in cases, kernel association testing in cases and controls and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) imputation into a larger cohort of WNND cases and seropositive controls followed by genome-wide association analysis. Variant filtration prioritized genes based on the enrichment of otherwise rare variants, but did not unambiguously implicate variants shared by a majority of cases. Kernel association demonstrated enrichment for risk and protective alleles in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and HLA-DQB1 loci that have well understood roles in antiviral immunity. Two loci, HERC5 and an intergenic region between CD83 and JARID2, were implicated by multiple imputed SNPs and exceeded genome-wide significance in a discovery cohort (n=862). SNPs at two additional loci, TFCP2L1 and CACNA1H, achieved genome-wide significance after association testing of directly genotyped and imputed SNPs in a discovery cohort (n=862) and a separate replication cohort (n=1387). The context of these loci suggests that immunoregulatory, ion channel and endothelial barrier functions may be important elements of the host response to WNV.

TI  - Identification of host genes leading to West Nile virus encephalitis in mice brain using RNA-seq analysis
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 6
AB  - Differential host responses may be critical determinants of distinct pathologies of West Nile virus (WNV) NY99 (pathogenic) and WNV Eg101 (non-pathogenic) strains. We employed RNA-seq technology to analyze global differential gene expression in WNV-infected mice brain and to identify the host cellular factors leading to lethal encephalitis. We identified 1,400 and 278 transcripts, which were differentially expressed after WNV NY99 and WNV Eg101 infections, respectively and 147 genes were common to infection with both the viruses. Genes that were up-regulated in infection with both the viruses were mainly associated with interferon signaling. Genes associated with inflammation and cell death/apoptosis were only expressed after WNV NY99 infection. We demonstrate that differences in the activation of key pattern recognition receptors resulted in the induction of unique innate immune profiles, which corresponded with the induction of interferon and inflammatory responses. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated that after WNV NY99 infection, TREM-1 mediated activation of toll-like receptors leads to the high inflammatory response. In conclusion, we have identified both common and specific responses to WNV NY99 and WNV Eg101 infections as well as genes linked to potential resistance to infection that may be targets for therapeutics.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 93 Pt 9
SP  - 1965
EP  - 75
AB  - The pre-membrane protein (prM) of West Nile virus (WNV) functions as a chaperone for correct folding of the envelope (E) protein, and prevents premature fusion during virus egress. However, little is known about its role in virulence. To investigate this, we compared the amino acid sequences of prM between a highly virulent North American strain (WNV(NY99)) and a weakly virulent Australian subtype (WNV(KUN)). Five amino acid differences occur in WNV(NY99) compared with WNV(KUN) (I22V, H43Y, L72S, S105A and A156V). When expressed in mammalian cells, recombinant WNV(NY99) prM retained native antigenic structure, and was partially exported to the cell surface. In contrast, WNV(KUN) prM (in the absence of the E protein) failed to express a conserved conformational epitope and was mostly retained at the pre-Golgi stage. Substitutions in residues 22 (Ile to Val) and 72 (Leu to Ser) restored the antigenic structure and cell surface expression of WNV(KUN) prM to the same level as that of WNV(NY99), and enhanced the secretion of WNV(KUN) prME particles when expressed in the presence of E. Introduction of the prM substitutions into a WNV(KUN) infectious clone (FLSDX) enhanced the secretion of infectious particles in Vero cells, and enhanced virulence in mice. These findings highlight the role of prM in viral particle secretion and virulence, and suggest the involvement of the L72S and I22V substitutions in modulating these activities.

VL  - 38
SP  - 5136
EP  - 5147
AB  - Abstract The Flavivirus genus comprise several important human pathogens, including dengue, West Nile, Yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. These enveloped viruses affect more than 2 billion people in the world, mainly in less developed countries. Although some vaccines exist for some flaviviruses, these vaccines are not universally available due to many factors and since their infections are a world-wide public health issue, the development of antiviral molecules is fundamental. Flavivirus membranes, through the help of the envelope E glycoprotein, fuse with endosomal compartments in a pH-dependent way to release their genome into the cytoplasm and require specific lipids, such as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), for efficient fusion. The fundamental role the envelope E protein has on viral entry and membrane fusion suggest that it is an essential antiviral target. In this work, we have used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the binding of the head-group of BMP to the tip of the envelope E proteins of ZIKV, DENV, TBEV and JEV viruses whose three-dimensional structures are known. Our results indicate that, apart from the fusion loop, there are different amino acid residues in different regions of the envelope E proteins of flaviviruses capable of binding the head-group of BMP. These regions should work together to accomplish the binding and fusion of the envelope and endosomal membranes and represent a new target to develop and design potent and effective antiviral agents capable of blocking flavivirus-endosome membrane fusion.

TI  - Immune Response to the West Nile Virus in Aged Non-Human Primates
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 5
AB  - Background Risk of encephalitis from West Nile virus (WNV) infection increases dramatically with age. Understanding the basis of this susceptibility requires development of suitable animal models. Here, we investigated the immune response to WNV in old non-human primates. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated clinical, immunological and virological correlates of WNV infection in aging non-human primates. Aged (17–30yrs) and adult (6–9yrs) Rhesus macaques (RM) were challenged with WNV in the presence or the absence of the mosquito salivary gland extract (SGE) to approximate natural infection. None of the 26 animals exhibited clinical signs of the disease. Quantitative PCR suggested discrete and short-lived viremia, but infectious virus was never isolated. There was markedly increased, age-independent, proliferation of CD3− non-B cells, followed by B-cell proliferation, which correlated to the loss of detectable WNV genomes. Moreover, animals primed with mosquito salivary gland extract exhibited reduced circulating WNV RNA. While we found the expected age-associated reduction in T cell proliferation, adaptive immunity did not correlate with infection outcome. That was further confirmed in a cohort of thymectomized and/or CD8 T-cell depleted Cynomolgus macaques (CM; N = 15), who also failed to develop WNV disease. Conclusions/significance Results are consistent with strong and age-independent innate resistance of macaques against WNV challenge. This animal model is therefore not suitable for vaccine and therapeutic testing against WNV. However, understanding the basis of their innate resistance against WNV in macaques could provide helpful clues to improve anti-WNV protection of older adults.

This review discusses our understanding of the interactions between virus and host that occur in the central nervous system (CNS), the outcome of which can be protection, viral pathogenesis, or immunopathogenesis. We will focus on defining the current state of knowledge of WNV entry, tropism, and host immune response in the CNS, all of which affect the balance between injury and successful clearance.

JF  - Viral immunology
VL  - 27 2

EP  - 47
AB  - Infections with West Nile virus (WNV) are typically asymptomatic, but some patients experience severe neurological disease and even death. Over 1500 fatalities have resulted from the more than 37,000 WNV cases in the USA between 1999 and 2012. While it is clear that age is a significant risk factor, markers of immune status associated with susceptibility to severe infections are incompletely defined. We have taken advantage of stable characteristics of individual status to profile immune markers from a stratified cohort of healthy subjects with a history of asymptomatic or severe infection with WNV. We characterized individual variations in antibody and serum cytokine levels and genome-wide transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood cells (PBMCs). While antibody levels were not significantly different between cohorts, we found that subjects with a history of severe infection had significantly lower levels of serum IL-4, and that these changes in IL-4 levels were associated with altered gene expression patterns in PBMCs. In addition, we identified a signature of 105 genes that displayed altered expression levels when comparing subjects with a history of asymptomatic or severe infection. These results suggest that systems-level analysis of immune system status can be used to identify factors relevant for susceptibility to severe infections, and specifically point to an important contribution for IL-4 in resistance to WNV infection.

TI  - Immune priming can prevent WNV establishment in Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes: evidence for immune priming based reversal of WNV-mediated immune suppression
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Mosquito-borne infectious diseases cause wide-spread loss of life and livelihood often in low-income settings. However, control of mosquito-vectored viral diseases such as West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) remains challenging. Here we use an existing feature of the insect immune system to effectively vaccinate Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes against WNV infection. We find that priming mosquitoes by exposure to inactivated WNV reduces their likelihood of developing transmissible infections of WNV after live infection. We used RNA sequencing to identify gene expression in response to WNV and JEV infection, and the role of prior priming exposure on constitutive and induced expression on infection. Infection with either Flavivirus causes broad suppression of gene expression. WNV and JEV infection resulted in suppression of different suites of genes with notable immune genes, such as antimicrobial peptides, being strongly suppressed on WNV infection. We hypothesise that the increased resistance to WNV infection seen in primed mosquitoes may be the result of priming nullifying the immune suppression found in non-primed WNV-fed mosquitoes, potentially through greater expression of mRNA regulatory genes such as cap-binding proteins in primed mosquitoes. Author summary Mosquitoes vector many devastating infectious diseases. Two such vectored viral diseases are West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Control of these diseases remains challenging, and no vaccine exists for WNV. Here, we tested whether we could instead vaccinate the mosquitoes against WNV. By injecting mosquitoes with dead WNV we found that we could reduce the number of infected mosquitoes by half. We then used whole-genome RNA sequencing to identify which genes are transcribed, which will help us understand genes that are important for this form of insect immune priming, and for responses to normal WNV and JEV infection. We found that WNV suppresses the expression of many immune genes but these genes are expressed normally in vaccinated mosquitoes. Our findings expand our understanding of mosquito infection with these viruses but also demonstrate how prior exposure to a disease can produce lasting protection.

JF  - Viral immunology
VL  - 32 1

EP  - 47
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a single-stranded RNA flavivirus and is a major cause of viral encephalitis worldwide. Experimental models of WNV infection in mice are commonly used to define acute neuroinflammatory responses in the brain. Alpha-synuclein (Asyn) is a protein of primarily neuronal origin and is a major cause of Parkinson's disease (PD), a disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons. Both WNV and PD pathologies are largely mediated by inflammation of the central nervous system (neuroinflammation) and have overlapping inflammatory pathways. In this review, we highlight the roles of the immune system in both diseases while comparing and contrasting both protective and pathogenic roles of immune cells and their effector proteins. Additionally, we review the current literature showing that Asyn is an important mediator of the immune response with diverging roles in PD (pathogenic) and WNV disease (neuroprotective).

TI  - Importin-7-dependent nuclear translocation of the Flavivirus core protein is required for infectious virus production
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 20
AB  - Flaviviridae is a family of positive-stranded RNA viruses, including human pathogens, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and West Nile virus (WNV). Nuclear localization of the viral core protein is conserved among Flaviviridae, and this feature may be targeted for developing broad-ranging anti-flavivirus drugs. However, the mechanism of core protein translocation to the nucleus and the importance of nuclear translocation in the viral life cycle remain unknown. We aimed to identify the molecular mechanism underlying core protein nuclear translocation. We identified importin-7 (IPO7), an importin-β family protein, as a nuclear carrier for Flaviviridae core proteins. Nuclear import assays revealed that core protein was transported into the nucleus via IPO7, whereas IPO7 deletion by CRISPR/Cas9 impaired their nuclear translocation. To understand the importance of core protein nuclear translocation, we evaluated the production of infectious virus or single-round-infectious-particles in wild-type or IPO7-deficient cells; both processes were significantly impaired in IPO7-deficient cells, whereas intracellular infectious virus levels were equivalent in wild-type and IPO7-deficient cells. These results suggest that IPO7-mediated nuclear translocation of core proteins is involved in the release of infectious virus particles of flaviviruses.

TI  - In Vitro and in Vivo Evaluation of Mutations in the NS Region of Lineage 2 West Nile Virus Associated with Neuroinvasiveness in a Mammalian Model
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 8
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) strains may differ significantly in neuroinvasiveness in vertebrate hosts. In contrast to genetic lineage 1 WNVs, molecular determinants of pathogenic lineage 2 strains have not been experimentally confirmed so far. A full-length infectious clone of a neurovirulent WNV lineage 2 strain (578/10; Central Europe) was generated and amino acid substitutions that have been shown to attenuate lineage 1 WNVs were introduced into the nonstructural proteins (NS1 (P250L), NS2A (A30P), NS3 (P249H) NS4B (P38G, C102S, E249G)). The mouse neuroinvasive phenotype of each mutant virus was examined following intraperitoneal inoculation of C57BL/6 mice. Only the NS1-P250L mutation was associated with a significant attenuation of virulence in mice compared to the wild-type. Multiplication kinetics in cell culture revealed significantly lower infectious virus titres for the NS1 mutant compared to the wild-type, as well as significantly lower amounts of positive and negative stranded RNA.

TI  - In vitro synthesis of West Nile virus proteins indicates that the amino-terminal segment of the NS3 protein contains the active centre of the protease which cleaves the viral polyprotein after multiple basic amino acids.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 72 ( Pt 4)
SP  - 851
EP  - 8
AB  - A virus-encoded protease that cleaves after multiple basic amino acid residues has been implicated in the processing of the flavivirus polyprotein. Recently, a computer search of amino acid residues which might form the active site of a protease led to the suggestion that the amino-terminal segment of the NS3 protein represents a serine protease. To examine this possibility we constructed an mRNA which encodes a polyprotein with an amino-terminal signal sequence derived from the influenza virus haemagglutinin, followed by a segment of the West Nile flavivirus polyprotein which includes the non-structural (NS) proteins NS2A, NS2B and the amino-terminal part of the NS3 protein. This polyprotein contains two sequences, located at the termini of the NS2B protein, which are cleaved by the viral protease that cleaves after multiple basic residues in the authentic polyprotein. The proteins that are generated by this mRNA during in vitro translation in the presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum membranes indicate that these two proteolytic cleavages occur in vitro. In vitro translation of polyproteins shortened at the carboxy terminus shows that a polyprotein which does not contain the complete set of proposed catalytic residues present in the NS3 protein segment accumulates as a membrane-associated molecule without proteolytic processing. Similarly, substitution of residue histidine 51 of the NS3 polyprotein segment, which is predicted to be part of the protease catalytic centre, with an alanine residue, blocks the processing of the polyprotein in vitro.

TI  - In-Depth Analysis of Genetic Variation Associated with Severe West Nile Viral Disease
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 8
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus which causes symptomatic disease in a minority of infected humans. To identify novel genetic variants associated with severe disease, we utilized data from an existing case-control study of WNV and included population controls for an expanded analysis. We conducted imputation and gene-gene interaction analysis in the largest and most comprehensive genetic study conducted to date for West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND). Within the imputed West Nile virus dataset (severe cases n = 381 and asymptomatic/mild controls = 441), we found novel loci within the MCF.2 Cell Line Derived Transforming Sequence Like (MCF2L) gene (rs9549655 and rs2297192) through the individual loci analyses, although none reached statistical significance. Incorporating population controls from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study on Aging (n = 9012) did not identify additional novel variants, a possible reflection of the cohort’s inclusion of individuals who could develop mild or severe WNV disease upon infection. Many of the top gene-gene interaction results were intergenic, with currently undefined biological roles, highlighting the need for further investigation into these regions and other identified gene targets in severe WNND. Further studies including larger sample sizes and more diverse populations reflective of those at risk are needed to fully understand the genetic architecture of severe WNDD and provide guidance on viable targets for therapeutic and vaccine development.

TI  - Increased Early RNA Replication by Chimeric West Nile Virus W956IC Leads to IPS-1-Mediated Activation of NF-κB and Insufficient Virus-Mediated Counteraction of the Resulting Canonical Type I Interferon Signaling
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 7952
EP  - 7965
AB  - ABSTRACT Although infections with “natural” West Nile virus (WNV) and the chimeric W956IC WNV infectious clone virus produce comparable peak virus yields in type I interferon (IFN) response-deficient BHK cells, W956IC infection produces higher levels of “unprotected” viral RNA at early times after infection. Analysis of infections with these two viruses in IFN-competent cells showed that W956IC activated NF-κB, induced higher levels of IFN-β, and produced lower virus yields than WNV strain Eg101. IPS-1 was required for both increased induction of IFN-β and decreased yields of W956IC. In Eg101-infected cells, phospho-STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation was blocked at all times analyzed, while some phospho-STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation was still detected at 8 h after infection in W956IC-infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and early viral protein levels were lower in these cells. A set of additional chimeras was made by replacing various W956IC gene regions with the Eg101 equivalents. As reported previously, for three of these chimeras, the low early RNA phenotype of Eg101 was restored in BHK cells. Analysis of infections with two of these chimeric viruses in MEFs detected lower early viral RNA levels, higher early viral protein levels, lower early IFN-β levels, and higher virus yields similar to those seen after Eg101 infection. The data suggest that replicase protein interactions directly or indirectly regulate genome switching between replication and translation at early times in favor of translation to minimize NF-κB activation and IFN induction by decreasing the amount of unprotected viral RNA, to produce sufficient viral protein to block canonical type I IFN signaling, and to efficiently remodel cell membranes for exponential genome amplification.

TI  - Induction of Endoplasmic Reticulum-Derived Replication-Competent Membrane Structures by West Nile Virus Non-Structural Protein 4B
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - Replication of flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae) occurs in specialized virus-induced membrane structures (IMS). The cellular composition of these IMS varies for different flaviviruses implying different organelle origins for IMS biogenesis. The role of flavivirus non-structural (NS) proteins for the alteration of IMS remains controversial. In this report, we demonstrate that West Nile virus strain New York 99 (WNVNY99) remodels the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to generate specialized IMS. Within these structures, we observed an element of the cis-Golgi, viral double-stranded RNA, and viral-envelope, NS1, NS4A and NS4B proteins using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Biochemical analysis and microscopy revealed that NS4B lacking the 2K-signal peptide associates with the ER membrane where it initiates IMS formation in WNV-infected cells. Co-transfection studies indicated that NS4A and NS4B always remain co-localized in the IMS and are associated with the same membrane fractions, suggesting that these proteins function cooperatively in virus replication and may be an ideal target for antiviral drug discovery.

JF  - Emerging Infectious Diseases
VL  - 8
SP  - 1379
EP  - 1384
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family of vector-borne pathogens. Clinical signs of WNV infection include neurologic symptoms, limb weakness, and encephalitis, which can result in paralysis or death. We report that the WNV-capsid (Cp) by itself induces rapid nuclear condensation and cell death in tissue culture. Apoptosis is induced through the mitochondrial pathway resulting in caspase-9 activation and downstream caspase-3 activation. Capsid gene delivery into the striatum of mouse brain or interskeletal muscle resulted in cell death and inflammation, likely through capsid-induced apoptosis in vivo. These studies demonstrate that the capsid protein of WNV may be responsible for aspects of viral pathogenesis through induction of the apoptotic cascade.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 5278
EP  - 5287
AB  - ABSTRACT MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding small RNAs that regulate multiple cellular processes, as well as the replication and pathogenesis of many DNA viruses and some RNA viruses. Examination of cellular miRNA profiles in West Nile virus (WNV)-infected HEK293 and SK-N-MC cells revealed increased expression of multiple miRNA species. One of these miRNAs, Hs_154, was significantly induced not only in WNV-infected neuronal cells in culture but also in the central nervous system tissues of infected mice and, upon transfection, caused a significant reduction in viral replication. Analysis of mRNA transcripts enriched through immunoprecipitation of the RNA-induced silencing complex identified several transcripts that contain seed sequence matches to Hs_154 in their 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Two of these targets, the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-coamplified and overexpressed protein (ECOP/VOPP1) proteins display reduced expression in WNV-infected cells, and the 3′ UTRs of these transcripts were sufficient to cause downregulation of expression in infected cells or in cells transfected with Hs_154, findings consistent with miRNA targeting of these transcripts. CTCF and ECOP have been shown to be associated with cell survival, implicating miRNA-directed repression of these targets in WNV-induced cell death. Consistent with this hypothesis, expression of these genes in WNV-infected cells results in a reduction in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis. These observations suggest that induction of Hs_154 expression after WNV infection modulates the apoptotic response to WNV and that cellular miRNA expression can be quickly altered during WNV infection to control aspects of the host response.

TI  - Infection of mouse neurones by West Nile virus is modulated by the interferon‐inducible 2′‐5′ oligoadenylate synthetase 1b protein
JF  - Immunology and Cell Biology
VL  - 81
AB  - Over the past 7 years, West Nile zoonosis has been an emerging concern for public health in Europe, Middle East and more recently in North America. West Nile virus causes epidemic outbreaks in humans and infected patients may exhibit severe neurological symptoms. Because susceptibility and sensitivity to West Nile virus infections may depend on host genetic factors, a mouse model has been established to investigate the genetic determinism of host susceptibility to West Nile virus. A nonsense mutation in gene encoding the 1b isoform of the 2′‐5′oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS1b) was constantly associated with the susceptibility of mouse strains to experimental West Nile virus infection. Oligoadenylate synthetase are interferon‐inducible proteins playing a role in the endogeneous antiviral pathway. It was of interest to establish whether interferon‐α and OAS 1B were sufficient to mediate resistance to West Nile virus infection. In the present study, we showed that interferon‐α had the ability to modulate West Nile virus infection in mouse. In vitro, interferon‐α protected mouse neuroblastoma cells against West Nile virus infection if cells have been pretreated with the cytokine for several hours. As a consequence of the presence of a stop codon, the Oas1b gene of the susceptible mice encodes a truncated and presumably inactive form, while resistant mice have a normal copy of the gene. Stable mouse neuroblastoma cell clones overexpressing mutant or wild‐type OAS 1B were established. Replication of West Nile virus was less efficient in cells that produce the normal copy of OAS 1B as compared to those expressing the truncated form. Our data illustrate the notion that interferon‐α and Oas genes may be critical for West Nile virus pathogenesis.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 83 Pt 10
SP  - 2427
EP  - 35
AB  - Both polarized epithelial Vero (C1008) and non-polarized Vero (control) cells were grown on permeable cell culture inserts and infected either apically or basolaterally with West Nile (WN) or Kunjin (KUN) virus. KUN virus (closely related to WN virus) was used as a comparison. Using indirect immunofluorescence and plaque assays of productive virus titres, entry of WN and KUN viruses was confined to the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. For the first time, these results provided evidence on the distribution of flavivirus-specific receptor(s) in polarized epithelial cells; that is to say that receptor expression was shown to be predominant at the apical surface. In addition, the release of these viruses from polarized Vero C1008 epithelial cells was also examined. Egress of WN virus strain Sarafend (S) was observed to occur predominantly at the apical surface of Vero C1008 cells. In contrast, the release of KUN virus was bi-directional from polarized Vero C1008 cells. Furthermore, disruption of the cellular microtubule network was shown to inhibit the apical release of WN (S) virus but had no effect on the release of KUN virus. Hence, the difference in the release of these closely related viruses suggested the involvement of a microtubule-dependent, polarized sorting mechanism for WN virus proteins but not for KUN virus proteins in polarized epithelial cells.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 10543
EP  - 10555
AB  - ABSTRACT The pathway of West Nile flavivirus early internalization events was mapped in detail in this study. Overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of Eps15 strongly inhibits West Nile virus (WNV) internalization, and pharmacological drugs that blocks clathrin also caused a marked reduction in virus entry but not caveola-dependent endocytosis inhibitory agent, filipin. Using immunocryoelectron microscopy, WNV particles were seen within clathrin-coated pits after 2 min postinfection. Double-labeling immunofluorescence assays and immunoelectron microscopy performed with anti-WNV envelope or capsid proteins and cellular markers (EEA1 and LAMP1) revealed the trafficking pathway of internalized virus particles from early endosomes to lysosomes and finally the uncoating of the virus particles. Disruption of host cell cytoskeleton (actin filaments and microtubules) with cytochalasin D and nocodazole showed significant reduction in virus infectivity. Actin filaments are shown to be essential during the initial penetration of the virus across the plasma membrane, whereas microtubules are involved in the trafficking of internalized virus from early endosomes to lysosomes for uncoating. Cells treated with lysosomotropic agents were largely resistant to infection, indicating that a low-pH-dependent step is required for WNV infection. In situ hybridization of DNA probes specific for viral RNA demonstrated the trafficking of uncoated viral RNA genomes to the endoplasmic reticulum.

TI  - Inflammasome Adaptor Protein Apoptosis-Associated Speck-Like Protein Containing CARD (ASC) Is Critical for the Immune Response and Survival in West Nile Virus Encephalitis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 3655
EP  - 3667
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus that has emerged globally as a significant cause of viral encephalitis in humans. The WNV-induced innate immune response, including production of antiviral cytokines, is critical for controlling virus infection. The adaptor protein ASC mediates a critical step in innate immune signaling by bridging the interaction between the pathogen recognition receptors and caspase 1 in inflammasome complexes, but its role in WNV immunopathogenesis is not defined. Here, we demonstrate that ASC is essential for interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production and development of effective host immunity against WNV. ASC-deficient mice exhibited increased susceptibility to WNV infection, and reduced survival was associated with enhanced virus replication in the peripheral tissues and central nervous system (CNS). Infection of cultured bone marrow-derived dendritic cells showed that ASC was essential for the activation of caspase 1, a key component of inflammasome assembly. ASC−/− mice exhibited attenuated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum. Intriguingly, infected ASC−/− mice also displayed reduced levels of alpha interferon (IFN-α) and IgM in the serum, indicating the overall protective role of ASC in restricting WNV infection. However, brains from ASC−/− mice displayed unrestrained inflammation, including elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IFN-γ, CCL2, and CCL5, which correlated with more pronounced activation of the astrocytes, enhanced infiltration of peripheral immune cells in the CNS, and increased neuronal cell death. Collectively, our data provide new insights into the role of ASC as an essential modulator of inflammasome-dependent and -independent immune responses to effectively control WNV infection.

TI  - Inflammatory Response Associated with West Nile Neuroinvasive Disease: A Systematic Review
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - Background: West Nile virus (WNV) infection is a seasonal arbovirosis with the potential to cause severe neurological disease. Outcomes of the infection from WNV depend on viral factors (e.g., lineage) and host-intrinsic factors (e.g., age, sex, immunocompromising conditions). Immunity is essential to control the infection but may also prove detrimental to the host. Indeed, the persistence of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines is associated with the development of blood–brain barrier (BBB) damage. Due to the importance of the inflammatory processes in the development of West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND), we reviewed the available literature on the subject. Methods: According to the 2020 updated PRISMA guidelines, all peer-reviewed articles regarding the inflammatory response associated with WNND were included. Results: One hundred and thirty-six articles were included in the data analysis and sorted into three groups (in vitro on-cell cultures, in vivo in animals, and in humans). The main cytokines found to be increased during WNND were IL-6 and TNF-α. We highlighted the generally small quantity and heterogeneity of information about the inflammatory patterns associated with WNND. Conclusions: Further studies are needed to understand the pathogenesis of WNND and to investigate the extent and the way the host inflammatory response either helps in controlling the infection or in worsening the outcomes. This might prove useful both for the development of target therapies and for the development of molecular markers allowing early identification of patients displaying an inflammatory response that puts them at a higher risk of developing neuroinvasive disease and who might thus benefit from early antiviral therapies.

TI  - Inhibition of Alpha/Beta Interferon Signaling by the NS4B Protein of Flaviviruses
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 8004
EP  - 8013
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses are insect-borne, positive-strand RNA viruses that have been disseminated worldwide. Their genome is translated into a polyprotein, which is subsequently cleaved by a combination of viral and host proteases to produce three structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins. The nonstructural protein NS4B of dengue 2 virus partially blocks activation of STAT1 and interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoters in cells stimulated with interferon (IFN). We have found that this function of NS4B is conserved in West Nile and yellow fever viruses. Deletion analysis shows that that the first 125 amino acids of dengue virus NS4B are sufficient for inhibition of alpha/beta IFN (IFN-α/β) signaling. The cleavable signal peptide at the N terminus of NS4B, a peptide with a molecular weight of 2,000, is required for IFN antagonism but can be replaced by an unrelated signal peptide. Coexpression of dengue virus NS4A and NS4B together results in enhanced inhibition of ISRE promoter activation in response to IFN-α/β. In contrast, expression of the precursor NS4A/B fusion protein does not cause an inhibition of IFN signaling unless this product is cleaved by the viral peptidase NS2B/NS3, indicating that proper viral polyprotein processing is required for anti-interferon function.

TI  - Inhibition of Interferon Signaling by the New York 99 Strain and Kunjin Subtype of West Nile Virus Involves Blockage of STAT1 and STAT2 Activation by Nonstructural Proteins
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 1934
EP  - 1942
AB  - ABSTRACT The interferon (IFN) response is the first line of defense against viral infections, and the majority of viruses have developed different strategies to counteract IFN responses in order to ensure their survival in an infected host. In this study, the abilities to inhibit IFN signaling of two closely related West Nile viruses, the New York 99 strain (NY99) and Kunjin virus (KUN), strain MRM61C, were analyzed using reporter plasmid assays, as well as immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses. We have demonstrated that infections with both NY99 and KUN, as well as transient or stable transfections with their replicon RNAs, inhibited the signaling of both alpha/beta IFN (IFN-α/β) and gamma IFN (IFN-γ) by blocking the phosphorylation of STAT1 and its translocation to the nucleus. In addition, the phosphorylation of STAT2 and its translocation to the nucleus were also blocked by KUN, NY99, and their replicons in response to treatment with IFN-α. IFN-α signaling and STAT2 translocation to the nucleus was inhibited when the KUN nonstructural proteins NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, and NS4B, but not NS1 and NS5, were expressed individually from the pcDNA3 vector. The results clearly demonstrate that both NY99 and KUN inhibit IFN signaling by preventing STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation and identify nonstructural proteins responsible for this inhibition.

TI  - Inhibition of West Nile Virus by Calbindin-D28k
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - Evidence indicates that West Nile virus (WNV) employs Ca2+ influx for its replication. Moreover, calcium buffer proteins, such as calbindin D28k (CB-D28k), may play an important role mitigating cellular destruction due to disease processes, and more specifically, in some neurological diseases. We addressed the hypothesis that CB-D28k inhibits WNV replication in cell culture and infected rodents. WNV envelope immunoreactivity (ir) was not readily co-localized with CB-D28k ir in WNV-infected Vero 76 or motor neuron-like NSC34 cells that were either stably or transiently transfected with plasmids coding for CB-D28k gene. This was confirmed in cultured cells fixed on glass coverslips and by flow cytometry. Moreover, WNV infectious titers were reduced in CB-D28k-transfected cells. As in cell culture studies, WNV env ir was not co-localized with CB-D28k ir in the cortex of an infected WNV hamster, or in the hippocampus of an infected mouse. Motor neurons in the spinal cord typically do not express CB-D28k and are susceptible to WNV infection. Yet, CB-D28k was detected in the surviving motor neurons after the initial phase of WNV infection in hamsters. These data suggested that induction of CB-D28k elicit a neuroprotective response to WNV infection.

AB  - BackgroundWest Nile virus (WNV) infection can cause severe meningitis and encephalitis in humans. Apoptosis was recently shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of WNV encephalitis. Here, we used WNV-infected glioma cells to study WNV-replication and WNV-induced apoptosis in human brain-derived cells.ResultsT98G cells are highly permissive for lytic WNV-infection as demonstrated by the production of infectious virus titre and the development of a characteristic cytopathic effect. WNV replication decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis as indicated by the activation of the effector caspase-3, the initiator caspases-8 and -9, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Truncation of BID indicated cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Inhibition of the caspases-8 or -9 inhibited PARP cleavage, demonstrating that both caspases are involved in WNV-induced apoptosis. Pan-caspase inhibition prevented WNV-induced apoptosis without affecting virus replication.ConclusionWe found that WNV infection induces cell death in the brain-derived tumour cell line T98G by apoptosis under involvement of constituents of the extrinsic as well as the intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Our results illuminate the molecular mechanism of WNV-induced neural cell death.

TI  - Inhibition of the Membrane Attack Complex by Dengue Virus NS1 through Interaction with Vitronectin and Terminal Complement Proteins
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 9570
EP  - 9581
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infects millions of people worldwide and is a major public health problem. DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a conserved glycoprotein that associates with membranes and is also secreted into the plasma in DENV-infected patients. The present study describes a novel mechanism by which NS1 inhibits the terminal complement pathway. We first identified the terminal complement regulator vitronectin (VN) as a novel DENV2 NS1 binding partner by using a yeast two-hybrid system. This interaction was further assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. The NS1-VN complex was also detected in plasmas from DENV-infected patients, suggesting that this interaction occurs during DENV infection. We also demonstrated that the DENV2 NS1 protein, either by itself or by interacting with VN, hinders the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and C9 polymerization. Finally, we showed that DENV2, West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) NS1 proteins produced in mammalian cells inhibited C9 polymerization. Taken together, our results points to a role for NS1 as a terminal pathway inhibitor of the complement system. IMPORTANCE Dengue is the most important arthropod-borne viral disease nowadays and is caused by dengue virus (DENV). The flavivirus NS1 glycoprotein has been characterized functionally as a complement evasion protein that can attenuate the activation of the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways. The present study describes a novel mechanism by which DENV NS1 inhibits the terminal complement pathway. We identified the terminal complement regulator vitronectin (VN) as a novel DENV NS1 binding partner, and the NS1-VN complex was detected in plasmas from DENV-infected patients, suggesting that this interaction occurs during DENV infection. We also demonstrated that the NS1-VN complex inhibited membrane attack complex (MAC) formation, thus interfering with the complement terminal pathway. Interestingly, NS1 itself also inhibited MAC activity, suggesting a direct role of this protein in the inhibition process. Our findings imply a role for NS1 as a terminal pathway inhibitor of the complement system.

TI  - Innate Immune Antagonism of Mosquito-Borne Flaviviruses in Humans and Mosquitoes
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Mosquito-borne viruses of the Flavivirus genus (Flaviviridae family) pose an ongoing threat to global public health. For example, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses are transmitted by infected mosquitoes and cause severe and fatal diseases in humans. The means by which mosquito-borne flaviviruses establish persistent infection in mosquitoes and cause disease in humans are complex and depend upon a myriad of virus-host interactions, such as those of the innate immune system, which are the main focus of our review. This review also covers the different strategies utilized by mosquito-borne flaviviruses to antagonize the innate immune response in humans and mosquitoes. Given the lack of antiviral therapeutics for mosquito-borne flaviviruses, improving our understanding of these virus-immune interactions could lead to new antiviral therapies and strategies for developing refractory vectors incapable of transmitting these viruses, and can also provide insights into determinants of viral tropism that influence virus emergence into new species.

AB  - Flaviviridae-caused diseases are a critical, emerging public health problem worldwide. Flaviviridae infections usually cause severe, acute or chronic diseases, such as liver damage and liver cancer resulting from a hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and high fever and shock caused by yellow fever. Many researchers worldwide are investigating the mechanisms by which Flaviviridae cause severe diseases. Flaviviridae can interfere with the host’s innate immunity to achieve their purpose of proliferation. For instance, dengue virus (DENV) NS2A, NS2B3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5; HCV NS2, NS3, NS3/4A, NS4B and NS5A; and West Nile virus (WNV) NS1 and NS4B proteins are involved in immune evasion. This review discusses the interplay between viral non-structural Flaviviridae proteins and relevant host proteins, which leads to the suppression of the host’s innate antiviral immunity.

TI  - Innate Immune Response of Primary Human Keratinocytes to West Nile Virus Infection and Its Modulation by Mosquito Saliva
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - West Nile Virus (WNV) is a flavivirus involved in many human infections worldwide. This arthropod-borne virus is directly co-inoculated with mosquito saliva through the epidermis and the dermis during blood meal. WNV starts replicating in the skin before migrating to the draining lymph node, leading to widespread viremia and in some cases to neurological symptoms. Skin is a complex organ composed of different cell types that together perform essential functions such as pathogen sensing, barrier maintenance and immunity. Keratinocytes, which represent 90% of the cells of the epidermis, are the organism's first line of defense, initiating innate immune response by recognizing pathogens through their pattern recognition receptors. Although WNV was previously known to replicate in human primary keratinocytes, the induced inflammatory response remains unknown. The aim of this study was first to characterize the inflammatory response of human primary keratinocytes to WNV infection and then, to assess the potential role of co-inoculated mosquito saliva on the keratinocyte immune response and viral replication. A type I and III interferon inflammatory response associated with an increase of IRF7 but not IRF3 mRNA expression, and dependent on infectious dose, was observed during keratinocyte infection with WNV. Expression of several interferon-stimulated gene mRNA was also increased at 24 h post-infection (p.i.); they included CXCL10 and interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT)-2 sustained up until 48 h p.i. Moreover, WNV infection of keratinocyte resulted in a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6) and various chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8 and CCL20) expression. The addition of Aedes aegypti or Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito saliva, two vectors of WNV infection, to infected keratinocytes led to a decrease of inflammatory response at 24 h p.i. However, only Ae. Aegypti saliva adjunction induced modulation of viral replication. In conclusion, this work describes for the first time the inflammatory response of human primary keratinocytes to WNV infection and its modulation in presence of vector mosquito saliva. The effects of mosquito saliva assessed in this work could be involved in the early steps of WNV replication in skin promoting viral spread through the body.

JF  - Immunology, Phenotype First: How Mutations Have Established New Principles and Pathways in Immunology
VL  - 321
SP  - 85
EP  - 100
AB  - Mouse susceptibility to experimental infections with flaviviruses is significantly influenced by a cluster of genes on chromosome 5 encoding a family of proteins with enzymatic properties, the 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS). Positional cloning of the locus in question has revealed that susceptibility of laboratory inbred strains to this class of virus is associated with a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the OAS1B isoform. Analysis of the molecular structure of the cluster in different mammalian species including human indicates that the cluster is extremely polymorphic with a highly variable number of genes and pseudogenes whose functions are not yet completely established. Although still preliminary, a few recent observations also substantiate a possible role for OAS1 in human susceptibility to viral infections (West Nile virus, SARS, etc.) and its possible involvement in some other diseases such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Finally, convergent observations indicate that the molecules encoded by the 2′–5′ OAS cluster might be involved in other fundamental cellular functions such as cell growth and differentiation, gene regulation, and apoptosis.

AB  - WNV continues to spread throughout the Western Hemisphere as virus activity in insects and animals has been reported in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands. West Nile virus (WNV) infects the central nervous system and causes severe disease primarily in humans who are immunocompromised or elderly. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which the immune system limits dissemination of WNV infection. Recent experimental studies in animals suggest important roles for both the innate and the adaptive immune responses in controlling WNV infection. Interferons, antibody, complement components and CD8+ T cells coordinate protection against severe infection and disease. These findings are analyzed in the context of recent approaches to vaccine development and immunotherapy against WNV.

JF  - World journal of virology
VL  - 2 2
SP  - 49
EP  - 56
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging neurotropic flavivirus that has recently spread to America and Southern Europe via an enzootic/epizootic bird-mosquito-bird transmission cycle. The virus can occasionally infect humans through mosquito bites, and man-to-man transmission has also been reported via infected blood or organ donation. In the human host, WNV causes asymptomatic infection in about 70%-80% of cases, while < 1% of clinical cases progress to severe neuroinvasive disease; long-term neurological sequelae are common in more than 50% of these severe cases. The pathogenesis of the neuroinvasive form of WNV infection remains incompletely understood, and risk factors for developing severe clinical illness are largely unknown. The innate immune response plays a major role in the control of WNV replication, which is supported by the fact that the virus has developed numerous mechanisms to escape the control of antiviral interferons. However, exaggerated inflammatory responses lead to pathology, mainly involving the central nervous system. This brief review presents the salient features of innate host responses, WNV immunoevasion strategies, and WNV-induced immunopathology.

TI  - Innate immune control of West Nile virus infection
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV), from the Flaviviridae family, is a re‐emerging zoonotic pathogen of medical importance. In humans, WNV infection may cause life‐threatening meningoencephalitis or long‐term neurologic sequelae. WNV is transmitted by Culex spp. mosquitoes and both the arthropod vector and the mammalian host are equipped with antiviral innate immune mechanisms sharing a common phylogeny. As far as the current evidence is able to demonstrate, mosquitoes primarily rely on RNA interference, Toll, Imd and JAK‐STAT signalling pathways for limiting viral infection, while mammals are provided with these and other more complex antiviral mechanisms involving antiviral effectors, inflammatory mediators, and cellular responses triggered by highly specialized pathogen detection mechanisms that often resemble their invertebrate ancestry. This mini‐review summarizes our current understanding of how the innate immune systems of the vector and the mammalian host react to WNV infection and shape its pathogenesis.

TI  - Insulin-mediated endothelin signaling is antiviral during West Nile virus infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 97
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus in the United States with approximately 2,000 cases each year. There are currently no approved human vaccines and a lack of prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. Understanding host responses to infection may reveal potential intervention targets to reduce virus replication and disease progression. The use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to understand innate immunity and host antiviral responses is well-established. Previous studies revealed that insulin-mediated signaling regulates WNV infection in invertebrates by regulating canonical antiviral pathways. Because insulin signaling is well-conserved across insect and mammalian species, we sought to determine if results using D. melanogaster can be extrapolated for the analysis of orthologous pathways in humans. Here, we identify insulin-mediated endothelin signaling using the D. melanogaster model and evaluate an orthologous pathway in human cells during WNV infection. We demonstrate that endothelin signaling reduces WNV replication through the activation of canonical antiviral signaling. Taken together, our findings show that endothelin-mediated antiviral immunity is broadly conserved across species and reduces replication of viruses that can cause severe human disease. IMPORTANCE Arboviruses, particularly those transmitted by mosquitoes, pose a significant threat to humans and are an increasing concern because of climate change, human activity, and expanding vector-competent populations. West Nile virus is of significant concern as the most frequent mosquito-borne disease transmitted annually within the continental United States. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized signaling pathway that impacts West Nile virus infection, namely endothelin signaling. Additionally, we demonstrate that we can successfully translate results obtained from D. melanogaster into the more relevant human system. Our results add to the growing field of insulin-mediated antiviral immunity and identify potential biomarkers or intervention targets to better address West Nile virus infection and severe disease.

TI  - Integrins modulate the infection efficiency of West Nile virus into cells
JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 94
SP  - 1723
EP  - 1733
AB  - The underlying mechanisms allowing West Nile virus (WNV) to replicate in a large variety of different arthropod, bird and mammal species are largely unknown but are believed to rely on highly conserved proteins relevant for viral entry and replication. Consistent with this, the integrin αvβ3 has been proposed lately to function as the cellular receptor for WNV. More recently published data, however, are not in line with this concept. Integrins are highly conserved among diverse taxa and are expressed by almost every cell type at high numbers. Our study was designed to clarify the involvement of integrins in WNV infection of cells. A cell culture model, based on wild-type and specific integrin knockout cell lines lacking the integrin subunits αv, β1 or β3, was used to investigate the susceptibility to WNV, and to evaluate binding and replication efficiencies of four distinct strains (New York 1999, Uganda 1937, Sarafend and Dakar). Though all cell lines were permissive, clear differences in replication efficiencies were observed. Rescue of the β3-integrin subunit resulted in enhanced WNV yields of up to 90 %, regardless of the virus strain used. Similar results were obtained for β1-expressing and non-expressing cells. Binding, however, was not affected by the expression of the integrins in question, and integrin blocking antibodies failed to have any effect. We conclude that integrins are involved in WNV infection but not at the level of binding to target cells.

TI  - Inter- and Intramolecular RNA–RNA Interactions Modulate the Regulation of Translation Mediated by the 3′ UTR in West Nile Virus
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 24
AB  - RNA viruses rely on genomic structural elements to accomplish the functions necessary to complete the viral cycle. These elements participate in a dynamic network of RNA–RNA interactions that determine the overall folding of the RNA genome and may be responsible for the fine regulation of viral replication and translation as well as the transition between them. The genomes of members of the genus Flavivirus are characterized by a complexly folded 3′ UTR with a number of RNA structural elements that are conserved across isolates of each species. The present work provides evidence of intra- and intermolecular RNA–RNA interactions involving RNA structural elements in the 3′ UTR of the West Nile virus genome. The intermolecular interactions can be visualized in vitro by the formation of molecular dimers involving the participation of at least the SLI and 3′DB elements. Certainly, the 3′ UTR of dengue virus, which lacks the SLI element, forms molecular dimers in lower quantities via a single interaction site, probably 3′DB. The functional analysis of sequence or deletion mutants revealed an inverse relationship between 3′ UTR dimerization and viral translation efficiency in cell cultures. A network of RNA–RNA interactions involving 3′ UTR structural elements might therefore exist, helping to regulate viral translation.

TI  - Interaction between the Cellular Protein eEF1A and the 3′-Terminal Stem-Loop of West Nile Virus Genomic RNA Facilitates Viral Minus-Strand RNA Synthesis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 10172
EP  - 10187
AB  - ABSTRACT RNase footprinting and nitrocellulose filter binding assays were previously used to map one major and two minor binding sites for the cell protein eEF1A on the 3′(+) stem-loop (SL) RNA of West Nile virus (WNV) (3). Base substitutions in the major eEF1A binding site or adjacent areas of the 3′(+) SL were engineered into a WNV infectious clone. Mutations that decreased, as well as ones that increased, eEF1A binding in in vitro assays had a negative effect on viral growth. None of these mutations affected the efficiency of translation of the viral polyprotein from the genomic RNA, but all of the mutations that decreased in vitro eEF1A binding to the 3′ SL RNA also decreased viral minus-strand RNA synthesis in transfected cells. Also, a mutation that increased the efficiency of eEF1A binding to the 3′ SL RNA increased minus-strand RNA synthesis in transfected cells, which resulted in decreased synthesis of genomic RNA. These results strongly suggest that the interaction between eEF1A and the WNV 3′ SL facilitates viral minus-strand synthesis. eEF1A colocalized with viral replication complexes (RC) in infected cells and antibody to eEF1A coimmunoprecipitated viral RC proteins, suggesting that eEF1A facilitates an interaction between the 3′ end of the genome and the RC. eEF1A bound with similar efficiencies to the 3′-terminal SL RNAs of four divergent flaviviruses, including a tick-borne flavivirus, and colocalized with dengue virus RC in infected cells. These results suggest that eEF1A plays a similar role in RNA replication for all flaviviruses.

TI  - Interaction of TIA-1/TIAR with West Nile and dengue virus products in infected cells interferes with stress granule formation and processing body assembly
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 104
SP  - 9041
EP  - 9046
AB  - The West Nile virus minus-strand 3′ terminal stem loop (SL) RNA was previously shown to bind specifically to cellular stress granule (SG) components, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) and the related protein TIAR. In vitro TIAR binding was 10 times more efficient than TIA-1. The 3′(−)SL functions as the promoter for genomic RNA synthesis. Colocalization of TIAR and TIA-1 with the viral replication complex components dsRNA and NS3 was observed in the perinuclear regions of West Nile virus- and dengue virus-infected cells. The kinetics of accumulation of TIAR in the perinuclear region was similar to those of genomic RNA synthesis. In contrast, relocation of TIA-1 to the perinuclear region began only after maximal levels of RNA synthesis had been achieved, except when TIAR was absent. Virus infection did not induce SGs and progressive resistance to SG induction by arsenite developed coincident with TIAR relocation. A progressive decrease in the number of processing bodies was secondarily observed in infected cells. These data suggest that the interaction of TIAR with viral components facilitates flavivirus genome RNA synthesis and inhibits SG formation, which prevents the shutoff of host translation.

TI  - Interaction of West Nile Virus with αvβ3 Integrin Mediates Virus Entry into Cells*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 279
SP  - 54533
EP  - 54541
AB  - The functional receptor for the flavivirus West Nile (WNV) infection has been characterized in this study with a combination of biochemical and molecular approaches. A 105-kDa protease-sensitive glycoprotein that binds WNV was isolated from the plasma membrane of cells permissive to WNV infection. The protein was subjected to peptide sequencing, and this glycoprotein was identified as a member of the integrin superfamily. Infection of WNV was shown to be markedly inhibited in Vero cells pretreated with blocking antibodies against αvβ3 integrin and its subunits by receptor competition assay. It was also noted that cells pretreated with antibodies against αvβ3 integrin can effectively inhibit flavivirus Japanese encephalitis but to a lesser extent flavivirus dengue infections. West Nile virus entry is independent of divalent cations and is not highly blocked by arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptides, suggesting that the interaction between the virus and αvβ3 integrin is not highly dependent on the classical RGD binding motif. In addition, gene silencing of the β3 integrin subunit in cells has resulted in cells largely resistant to WNV infection. In contrast, expression of recombinant human β3 integrin substantially increased the permissiveness of CS-1 melanoma cells for WNV infection. Soluble αvβ3 integrin can also effectively block WNV infection in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, WNV infection also triggered the outside-in signaling pathway via the activation of integrin-associated focal adhesion kinase. The identification of αvβ3 integrin as a receptor for WNV provides insight into virus-receptor interaction, hence creating opportunities in the development of anti-viral strategies against WNV infection.

TI  - Interactions between West Nile Virus and the Microbiota of Culex pipiens Vectors: A Literature Review
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - The flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV) naturally circulates between mosquitoes and birds, potentially affecting humans and horses. Different species of mosquitoes play a role as vectors of WNV, with those of the Culex pipiens complex being particularly crucial for its circulation. Different biotic and abiotic factors determine the capacity of mosquitoes for pathogen transmission, with the mosquito gut microbiota being recognized as an important one. Here, we review the published studies on the interactions between the microbiota of the Culex pipiens complex and WNV infections in mosquitoes. Most articles published so far studied the interactions between bacteria of the genus Wolbachia and WNV infections, obtaining variable results regarding the directionality of this relationship. In contrast, only a few studies investigate the role of the whole microbiome or other bacterial taxa in WNV infections. These studies suggest that bacteria of the genera Serratia and Enterobacter may enhance WNV development. Thus, due to the relevance of WNV in human and animal health and the important role of mosquitoes of the Cx. pipiens complex in its transmission, more research is needed to unravel the role of mosquito microbiota and those factors affecting this microbiota on pathogen epidemiology. In this respect, we finally propose future lines of research lines on this topic.

TI  - Interactions between the West Nile virus capsid protein and the host cell‐encoded phosphatase inhibitor, I2PP2A
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 9
AB  - The West Nile virus (WNV) capsid protein functions in virus assembly to package genomic RNA into nucleocapsid structures. It is becoming clear, that in addition to their structural roles, capsid proteins of RNA viruses have non‐structural functions. For example, the WNV capsid protein has been implicated as a pathogenic determinant. Presumably, many, if not all, of the non‐structural functions of this protein involve interactions with host cell‐encoded proteins. In the present study, we used affinity purification to isolate human proteins that bind to the WNV capsid protein. One of the capsid binding proteins is I2PP2A, a previously characterized inhibitor of the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A. Mapping studies revealed that capsid binding site overlaps with the region of I2PP2A that is required for inhibition of PP2A activity. Moreover, expression of the WNV capsid protein resulted in significantly increased PP2A activity and expected downstream events, such as inhibition of AP1‐dependent transcription. Infected cells treated with I2PP2A‐specific siRNAs produced less infectious virus than control siRNA‐transfected cells, but this difference was minimal. Together, our data indicate that interactions between WNV capsid and I2PP2A result in increased PP2A activity. Given the central role of this phosphatase in cellular physiology, capsid/I2PP2A interactions may yet prove to be important for viral pathogenesis.

TI  - Interference with the production of infectious viral particles and bimodal inhibition of replication are broadly conserved antiviral properties of IFITMs
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 13
AB  - IFITMs are broad antiviral factors that block incoming virions in endosomal vesicles, protecting target cells from infection. In the case of HIV-1, we and others reported the existence of an additional antiviral mechanism through which IFITMs lead to the production of virions of reduced infectivity. However, whether this second mechanism of inhibition is unique to HIV or extends to other viruses is currently unknown. To address this question, we have analyzed the susceptibility of a broad spectrum of viruses to the negative imprinting of the virion particles infectivity by IFITMs. The results we have gathered indicate that this second antiviral property of IFITMs extends well beyond HIV and we were able to identify viruses susceptible to the three IFITMs altogether (HIV-1, SIV, MLV, MPMV, VSV, MeV, EBOV, WNV), as well as viruses that displayed a member-specific susceptibility (EBV, DUGV), or were resistant to all IFITMs (HCV, RVFV, MOPV, AAV). The swapping of genetic elements between resistant and susceptible viruses allowed us to point to specificities in the viral mode of assembly, rather than glycoproteins as dominant factors of susceptibility. However, we also show that, contrarily to X4-, R5-tropic HIV-1 envelopes confer resistance against IFITM3, suggesting that viral receptors add an additional layer of complexity in the IFITMs-HIV interplay. Lastly, we show that the overall antiviral effects ascribed to IFITMs during spreading infections, are the result of a bimodal inhibition in which IFITMs act both by protecting target cells from incoming viruses and in driving the production of virions of reduced infectivity. Overall, our study reports for the first time that the negative imprinting of the virion particles infectivity is a conserved antiviral property of IFITMs and establishes IFITMs as a paradigm of restriction factor capable of interfering with two distinct phases of a virus life cycle.

TI  - Interferon Regulatory Factor 5-Dependent Immune Responses in the Draining Lymph Node Protect against West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 11007
EP  - 11021
AB  - ABSTRACT Upon activation of Toll-like and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways, the transcription factor IRF5 translocates to the nucleus and induces antiviral immune programs. The recent discovery of a homozygous mutation in the immunoregulatory gene guanine exchange factor dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (Dock2 mu/mu ) in several Irf5 −/− mouse colonies has complicated interpretation of immune functions previously ascribed to IRF5. To define the antiviral functions of IRF5 in vivo, we infected backcrossed Irf5 −/− × Dock2 wt/wt mice (here called Irf5 −/− mice) and independently generated CMV-Cre Irf5 fl/fl mice with West Nile virus (WNV), a pathogenic neurotropic flavivirus. Compared to congenic wild-type animals, Irf5 −/− and CMV-Cre Irf5 fl/fl mice were more vulnerable to WNV infection, and this phenotype was associated with increased infection in peripheral organs, which resulted in higher virus titers in the central nervous system. The loss of IRF5, however, was associated with only small differences in the type I interferon response systemically and in the draining lymph node during WNV infection. Instead, lower levels of several other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as fewer and less activated immune cells, were detected in the draining lymph node 2 days after WNV infection. WNV-specific antibody responses in Irf5 −/− mice also were blunted in the context of live or inactivated virus infection and this was associated with fewer antigen-specific memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells. Our results with Irf5 −/− mice establish a key role for IRF5 in shaping the early innate immune response in the draining lymph node, which impacts the spread of virus infection, optimal B cell immunity, and disease pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Although the roles of IRF3 and IRF7 in orchestrating innate and adaptive immunity after viral infection are established, the function of the related transcription factor IRF5 remains less certain. Prior studies in Irf5 −/− mice reported conflicting results as to the contribution of IRF5 in regulating type I interferon and adaptive immune responses. The lack of clarity may stem from a recently discovered homozygous loss-of-function mutation of the immunoregulatory gene Dock2 in several colonies of Irf5 −/− mice. Here, using a mouse model with a deficiency in IRF5 and wild-type Dock2 alleles, we investigated how IRF5 modulates West Nile virus (WNV) pathogenesis and host immune responses. Our in vivo studies indicate that IRF5 has a key role in shaping the early proinflammatory cytokine response in the draining lymph node, which impacts immunity and control of WNV infection.

TI  - Interferon Regulatory Factor IRF-7 Induces the Antiviral Alpha Interferon Response and Protects against Lethal West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 8465
EP  - 8475
AB  - ABSTRACT Type I interferon (IFN-α/β) comprises a family of immunomodulatory cytokines that are critical for controlling viral infections. In cell culture, many RNA viruses trigger IFN responses through the binding of RNA recognition molecules (RIG-I, MDA5, and TLR-3) and induction of interferon regulatory factor IRF-3-dependent gene transcription. Recent studies with West Nile virus (WNV) have shown that type I IFN is essential for restricting infection and that a deficiency of IRF-3 results in enhanced lethality. However, IRF-3 was not required for optimal systemic IFN production in vivo or in vitro in macrophages. To begin to define the transcriptional factors that regulate type I IFN after WNV infection, we evaluated IFN induction and virus control in IRF-7−/− mice. Compared to congenic wild-type mice, IRF-7−/− mice showed increased lethality after WNV infection and developed early and elevated WNV burdens in both peripheral and central nervous system tissues. As a correlate, a deficiency of IRF-7 blunted the systemic type I IFN response in mice. Consistent with this, IFN-α gene expression and protein production were reduced and viral titers were increased in IRF-7−/− primary macrophages, fibroblasts, dendritic cells, and cortical neurons. In contrast, in these cells the IFN-β response remained largely intact. Our data suggest that the early protective IFN-α response against WNV occurs through an IRF-7-dependent transcriptional signal.

TI  - Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 (IRF-1) Shapes Both Innate and CD8+ T Cell Immune Responses against West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 7
AB  - Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 is an immunomodulatory transcription factor that functions downstream of pathogen recognition receptor signaling and has been implicated as a regulator of type I interferon (IFN)-αβ expression and the immune response to virus infections. However, this role for IRF-1 remains controversial because altered type I IFN responses have not been systemically observed in IRF-1 -/- mice. To evaluate the relationship of IRF-1 and immune regulation, we assessed West Nile virus (WNV) infectivity and the host response in IRF-1 -/- cells and mice. IRF-1 -/- mice were highly vulnerable to WNV infection with enhanced viral replication in peripheral tissues and rapid dissemination into the central nervous system. Ex vivo analysis revealed a cell-type specific antiviral role as IRF-1 -/- macrophages supported enhanced WNV replication but infection was unaltered in IRF-1 -/- fibroblasts. IRF-1 also had an independent and paradoxical effect on CD8+ T cell expansion. Although markedly fewer CD8+ T cells were observed in naïve animals as described previously, remarkably, IRF-1 -/- mice rapidly expanded their pool of WNV-specific cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Adoptive transfer and in vitro proliferation experiments established both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic effects of IRF-1 on the expansion of CD8+ T cells. Thus, IRF-1 restricts WNV infection by modulating the expression of innate antiviral effector molecules while shaping the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response.

TI  - Interferon and Interferon-Induced Chemokine Expression Is Associated with Control of Acute Viremia in West Nile Virus-Infected Blood Donors
JF  - The Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 198
SP  - 979
EP  - 983
AB  - Abstract To understand early host responses controlling West Nile virus (WNV) infection, acutely viremic blood donors, identified by nucleic acid amplification testing, were enrolled and monitored for RNA-clearance and WNV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies. Viral load and chemokine and cytokine assays were performed on serial samples from donors whose index and first follow-up samples tested negative for IgM. A total of 84% of the specimens obtained from viremic donors before IgM/IgG seroconversion demonstrated a decreasing viral load. Levels of interferon (IFN)-α ere significantly increased before IgM seroconversion, relative to those in control specimens. CXCL10 and CCL2 were significantly elevated in donor specimens obtained before IgM seroconversion, compared with those obtained after IgM seroconversion. These findings suggest that IFN-mediated innate immunity plays a key role in initial control of WNV replication.

TI  - Interferon-λ restricts West Nile virus neuroinvasion by tightening the blood-brain barrier
JF  - Science Translational Medicine
VL  - 7
SP  - 284ra59
EP  - 284ra59
AB  - Interferon-λ signaling tightens the blood-brain barrier and limits the ability of West Nile virus to infect the central nervous system in mice. Interfering with viral neuroinvasion Interferon-λ is among many secreted host proteins that activate an antiviral response. In new work, Lazear et al. observed that mice with genetic defects in interferon-λ signaling sustained greater West Nile virus infection in the brain and spinal cord, even though interferon-λ did not inhibit viral replication directly. Instead, interferon-λ signaling tightened the blood-brain barrier and limited West Nile virus dissemination into the brain. Administration of exogenous interferon-λ protected mice from West Nile virus infection in the brain and subsequent death. Thus, interferon-λ contributes to maintaining tissue barriers that restrict viral pathogenesis. Although interferon-λ [also known as type III interferon or interleukin-28 (IL-28)/IL-29] restricts infection by several viruses, its inhibitory mechanism has remained uncertain. We used recombinant interferon-λ and mice lacking the interferon-λ receptor (IFNLR1) to evaluate the effect of interferon-λ on infection with West Nile virus, an encephalitic flavivirus. Cell culture studies in mouse keratinocytes and dendritic cells showed no direct antiviral effect of exogenous interferon-λ, even though expression of interferon-stimulated genes was induced. We observed no differences in West Nile virus burden between wild-type and Ifnlr1−/− mice in the draining lymph nodes, spleen, or blood. We detected increased West Nile virus infection in the brain and spinal cord of Ifnlr1−/− mice, yet this was not associated with a direct antiviral effect in mouse neurons. Instead, we observed an increase in blood-brain barrier permeability in Ifnlr1−/− mice. Treatment of mice with pegylated interferon-λ2 resulted in decreased blood-brain barrier permeability, reduced West Nile virus infection in the brain without affecting viremia, and improved survival against lethal virus challenge. An in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier showed that interferon-λ signaling in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells increased transendothelial electrical resistance, decreased virus movement across the barrier, and modulated tight junction protein localization in a protein synthesis– and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)–independent manner. Our data establish an indirect antiviral function of interferon-λ in which noncanonical signaling through IFNLR1 tightens the blood-brain barrier and restricts viral neuroinvasion and pathogenesis.

TI  - Interleukins, Chemokines, and Tumor Necrosis Factor Superfamily Ligands in the Pathogenesis of West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that can lead to encephalitis and death in susceptible hosts. Cytokines play a critical role in inflammation and immunity in response to WNV infection. Murine models provide evidence that some cytokines offer protection against acute WNV infection and assist with viral clearance, while others play a multifaceted role WNV neuropathogenesis and immune-mediated tissue damage. This article aims to provide an up-to-date review of cytokine expression patterns in human and experimental animal models of WNV infections. Here, we outline the interleukins, chemokines, and tumor necrosis factor superfamily ligands associated with WNV infection and pathogenesis and describe the complex roles they play in mediating both protection and pathology of the central nervous system during or after virus clearance. By understanding of the role of these cytokines during WNV neuroinvasive infection, we can develop treatment options aimed at modulating these immune molecules in order to reduce neuroinflammation and improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Interplay between Inflammation and Cellular Stress Triggered by Flaviviridae Viruses
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 7
AB  - The Flaviviridae family comprises several human pathogens, including Dengue, Zika, Yellow Fever, West Nile, Japanese Encephalitis viruses, and Hepatitis C Virus. Those are enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses, which replicate mostly in intracellular compartments associated to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex. Virus replication results in abundant viral RNAs and proteins, which are recognized by cellular mechanisms evolved to prevent virus infection, resulting in inflammation and stress responses. Virus RNA molecules are sensed by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RIG-I and MDA5) and RNA-dependent protein kinases (PKR), inducing the production of inflammatory mediators and interferons. Simultaneously, the synthesis of virus RNA and proteins are distinguished in different compartments such as mitochondria, ER and cytoplasmic granules, triggering intracellular stress pathways, including oxidative stress, unfolded protein response pathway, and stress granules assembly. Here, we review the new findings that connect the inflammatory pathways to cellular stress sensors and the strategies of Flaviviridae members to counteract these cellular mechanisms and escape immune response.

EP  - 25
AB  - Hepatitis C virus and related viruses in the Flaviviridae family (such as dengue virus, yellow fever virus or West Nile virus) are amongst the most important human pathogens, causing substantial morbidity and mortality world-wide. The production of viral progeny in Flaviviridae is orchestrated by the small, multifunctional core protein, which coats and condenses the viral genomic RNA during Nucleocapsid formation. In addition to their structural role, mounting experimental evidence links core proteins to viral persistence and pathogenesis, by virtue of their promiscuous interactions with host cell factors. In this review, we summarize the present knowledge about the structure of Flaviviridae core proteins and discuss the importance of flexible, intrinsically unstructured protein regions in viral assembly and hub formation in the virus-host protein-protein interaction network (infection network).

TI  - Involvement of the JNK‐like protein of the Aedes albopictus mosquito cell line, C6/36, in phagocytosis, endocytosis and infection of West Nile virus
JF  - Insect Molecular Biology
VL  - 12
AB  - We recently cloned a c‐Jun amino‐terminal kinase (JNK) sequence from the C6/36 cell line, derived from the mosquito Aedes albopictus. We showed that SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK proteins, inhibits phagocytosis by C6/36 cells, suggesting that the JNK‐like protein regulates phagocytosis. Here, we show that C6/36 cells constitutively express low levels of mRNA encoding the antibacterial peptides, cecropin and defensin, but that these mRNAs were up‐regulated upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Thus, the C6/36 cells have properties similar to those of mammalian macrophages. To characterize further the functional properties of C6/36 cells, we have assayed the role of the JNK‐like protein in phagocytosis, endocytosis, and viral infection. C6/36 cells phagocytosed bacteria and artificial beads, and this was only slightly up‐regulated following LPS stimulation, suggesting that newly stimulated JNK‐like protein was not necessary for phagocytosis. SP600125 inhibited the acidification of intracellular compartments, including those involved in the endocytic pathway. Pretreatment of C6/36 cells with SP600125 or bafilomycin A1, but not cytochalasin D, inhibited the entry of West Nile virus (WNV), suggesting that WNV is internalized mainly by endocytosis, and that the JNK signalling pathway is important for endocytic entry. These findings indicate that the JNK‐like protein regulates basic physiological functions, including phagocytosis and endocytosis and infection of WNV.

TI  - Iron availability affects West Nile virus infection in its mosquito vector
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 14
AB  - Mosquitoes are responsible for transmission of viruses, including dengue, West Nile and chikungunya viruses. Female mosquitoes are infected when they blood-feed on vertebrates, a required step for oogenesis. During this process, mosquitoes encounter high iron loads. Since iron is an essential nutrient for most organisms, including pathogens, one of the defense mechanisms for the host includes sequestration of iron away from the invading pathogen. Here, we determine whether iron availability affects viral replication in mosquitoes. To elucidate effect of iron availability on mosquito cells during infection, Culex cells were treated with either ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) or the iron chelator, deferoxamine (DFX). Real time RT-PCR was performed using ferritin (heavy chain) and NRAMP as a measure of iron homeostasis in cells. To determine iron requirement for viral replication, Culex cells were knocked down for NRAMP using dsRNA. Finally, the results were validated in Culex mosquito-infection model, by treating infected mosquitoes with DFX to reduce iron levels. Our results show that infection of Culex cells led to induction in levels of ferritin (heavy chain) and NRAMP mRNAs in time-dependent manner. Results also showed that treatment of cells with FAC, reduced expression of NRAMP (iron transporter) and increase levels of ferritin (heavy chain). Interestingly, increasing iron levels increased viral titers; while reducing intracellular iron levels, either by NRAMP knock-down or using DFX, reduced viral titers. The results from Culex mosquito infection showed that mosquitoes treated with DFX had reduced viral titers compared with untreated controls in midgut as well as carcass 8 days pi. Saliva from mosquitoes treated with DFX also showed reduced viral titers compared with untreated controls, indicating low viral transmission capacity. Our results indicate that iron is required for viral replication in mosquito cells. Mosquitoes respond to viral infection, by inducing expression of heavy chain ferritin, which sequesters available iron, reducing its availability to virus infected cells. The data indicates that heavy chain ferritin may be part of an immune mechanism of mosquitoes in response to viral infections.

TI  - Jab1 Mediates Cytoplasmic Localization and Degradation of West Nile Virus Capsid Protein*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 281
SP  - 30166
EP  - 30174
AB  - The clinical manifestations of West Nile virus (WNV), a member of the Flavivirus family, include febrile illness, sporadic encephalitis, and paralysis. The capsid (Cp) of WNV is thought to participate in these processes by inducing apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. To further identify the molecular mechanism of the WNV capsid protein (WNVCp), yeast two-hybrid assays were employed using WNV-Cp as bait. Jab1, the fifth subunit of the COP9 signalosome, was subsequently identified as a molecule that interacts with WNVCp. Immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays confirmed that direct interaction could occur between WNVCp and Jab1. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the overexpressed WNVCp, which localized to the nucleolus, was translocated to the cytoplasm upon its co-expression with Jab1. When treated with leptomycin B, Jab1-facilitated nuclear exclusion of WNVCp was prevented, which indicated that the CRM1 complex is required for Jab1-facilitated nuclear export of WNVCp. Moreover, Jab1 promoted the degradation of WNVCp in a proteasome-dependent way. Consistent with this, WNVCp-mediated cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase in H1299 was prevented by exogenous Jab1. Finally, an analysis of WNVCp deletion mutants indicated that the first 15 amino acids were required for interaction with Jab1. Furthermore, the double-point mutant of the WNVCp, P5A/P8A, was incapable of binding to Jab1. These results indicate that Jab1 has a potential protective effect against pathogenic WNVCp and might provide a novel target site for the treatment of disease caused by WNV.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85

EP  - 5201
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) replicates in the skin; however, cell targets in the skin have not been identified. In the current studies, WNV infected the epidermis and adnexal glands of mouse skin, and the epidermal cells were identified as keratinocytes by double labeling for WNV antigen and keratin 10. Inoculation of mice with WNV replicon particles resulted in high levels of replication in the skin, suggesting that keratinocytes are an initial target of WNV. In addition, primary keratinocytes produced infectious virus in vitro. In conclusion, keratinocytes are cell targets of WNV in vivo and may play an important role in pathogenesis.

TI  - Last 20 aa of the West Nile virus NS1' protein are responsible for its retention in cells and the formation of unique heat-stable dimers.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 96 Pt 5
SP  - 1042
EP  - 54
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is the major cause of arboviral encephalitis in the USA. As with other members of the Japanese encephalitis virus serogroup, WNV produces an additional non-structural protein, NS1', a C-terminal extended product of NS1 generated as the result of a -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (PRF). We have previously shown that mutations abolishing the PRF, and consequently NS1', resulted in reduced neuroinvasiveness. However, whether this was caused by the PRF event itself or by the lack of a PRF product, NS1', or a combination of both, remains undetermined. Here, we showed that WNV NS1' formed a unique subpopulation of heat- and low-pH-stable dimers. C-terminal truncations and mutational analysis employing an NS1'-expressing plasmid showed that stability of NS1' dimers was linked to the penultimate 10 aa. To examine the role of NS1' heat-stable dimers in virus replication and pathogenicity, a stop codon mutation was introduced into NS1' to create a WNV producing a truncated version of NS1' lacking the last 20 aa, but not affecting the PRF. NS1' protein produced by this mutant virus was secreted more efficiently than WT NS1', indicating that the sequence of the last 20 aa of NS1' was responsible for its cellular retention. Further analysis of this mutant showed growth kinetics in cells and virulence in weanling mice after peripheral infection similar to the WT WNVKUN, suggesting that full-length NS1' was not essential for virus replication in vitro and for virulence in mice.

TI  - Lipid Interactions Between Flaviviruses and Mosquito Vectors
JF  - Frontiers in Physiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses, threaten a large part of the human populations. In absence of therapeutics and effective vaccines against each flaviviruses, targeting viral metabolic requirements in mosquitoes may hold the key to new intervention strategies. Development of metabolomics in the last decade opened a new field of research: mosquito metabolomics. It is now clear that flaviviruses rely on mosquito lipids, especially phospholipids, for their cellular cycle and propagation. Here, we review the biosyntheses of, biochemical properties of and flaviviral interactions with mosquito phospholipids. Phospholipids are structural lipids with a polar headgroup and apolar acyl chains, enabling the formation of lipid bilayer that form plasma- and endomembranes. Phospholipids are mostly synthesized through the de novo pathway and remodeling cycle. Variations in headgroup and acyl chains influence phospholipid physicochemical properties and consequently the membrane behavior. Flaviviruses interact with cellular membranes at every step of their cellular cycle. Recent evidence demonstrates that flaviviruses reconfigure the phospholipidome in mosquitoes by regulating phospholipid syntheses to increase virus multiplication. Identifying the phospholipids involved and understanding how flaviviruses regulate these in mosquitoes is required to design new interventions.

TI  - Loss of DAP12 and FcRγ Drives Exaggerated IL-12 Production and CD8+ T Cell Response by CCR2+ Mo-DCs
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 8
AB  - Dap12 and FcRγ, the two transmembrane ITAM-containing signaling adaptors expressed in dendritic cells (DC), are implicated in the regulation of DC function. Several activating and adhesion receptors including integrins require these chains for their function in triggering downstream signaling and effector pathways, however the exact role(s) for Dap12 and FcRγ remains elusive as their loss can lead to both attenuating and enhancing effects. Here, we report that mice congenitally lacking both Dap12 and FcRγ chains (DF) show a massively enhanced effector CD8+ T cell response to protein antigen immunization or West Nile Virus (WNV) infection. Thus, immunization of DF mice with MHCI-restricted OVA peptide leads to accumulation of IL-12-producing monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC) in draining lymph nodes, followed by vastly enhanced generation of antigen-specific IFNγ-producing CD8+ T cells. Moreover, DF mice show increased viral clearance in the WNV infection model. Depletion of CCR2+ monocytes/macrophages in vivo by administration anti-CCR2 antibodies or clodronate liposomes completely prevents the exaggerated CD8+ T cell response in DF mice. Mechanistically, we show that the loss of Dap12 and FcRγ-mediated signals in Mo-DC leads to a disruption of GM-CSF receptor-induced STAT5 activation resulting in upregulation of expression of IRF8, a transcription factor. Consequently, Dap12- and FcRγ-deficiency exacerbates GM-CSF-driven monocyte differentiation and production of inflammatory Mo-DC. Our data suggest a novel cross-talk between DC-ITAM and GM-CSF signaling pathways, which controls Mo-DC differentiation, IL-12 production, and CD8+ T cell responses.

TI  - Loss of dimerisation of the nonstructural protein NS1 of Kunjin virus delays viral replication and reduces virulence in mice, but still allows secretion of NS1.
JF  - Virology
VL  - 264 1
SP  - 66
EP  - 75
AB  - The flavivirus nonstructural protein NS1 has been implicated in viral RNA replication, although its precise role has not been identified. In its native state NS1 exists as a heat labile homodimer that is thought to be required for NS1 function and secretion. However, we have recently identified a cDNA clone of KUN virus (FLSD) that replicates efficiently in cell culture but produces and secretes NS1 in monomeric form. Sequence analysis of the NS1 gene in FLSD revealed a single amino acid substitution (proline(250) to leucine) when compared with the parental KUN virus. When site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute leucine(250) with proline in FLSD to produce the clone 250pro, dimerisation was fully restored. Furthermore, time course experiments revealed that 250pro replicated in Vero cells significantly faster than FLSD and produced 100-fold more infectious virus early (12-24 h) in infection. This correlated with our observations that FLSD required approximately 10-fold more infectious virus than 250pro to produce disease in weanling mice after intraperitoneal inoculation. Taken together our results indicate that mutation from proline to leucine at residue 250 in KUN NS1 ablates dimer formation, slows virus replication, and reduces virulence in mice.

TI  - MAVS Expressed by Hematopoietic Cells Is Critical for Control of West Nile Virus Infection and Pathogenesis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 7098
EP  - 7108
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is the most important cause of epidemic encephalitis in North America. Innate immune responses, which are critical for control of WNV infection, are initiated by signaling through pathogen recognition receptors, RIG-I and MDA5, and their downstream adaptor molecule, MAVS. Here, we show that a deficiency of MAVS in hematopoietic cells resulted in increased mortality and delayed WNV clearance from the brain. In Mavs −/− mice, a dysregulated immune response was detected, characterized by a massive influx of macrophages and virus-specific T cells into the infected brain. These T cells were polyfunctional and lysed peptide-pulsed target cells in vitro. However, virus-specific T cells in the brains of infected Mavs −/− mice exhibited lower functional avidity than those in wild-type animals, and even virus-specific memory T cells generated by prior immunization could not protect Mavs −/− mice from WNV-induced lethal disease. Concomitant with ineffective virus clearance, macrophage numbers were increased in the Mavs −/− brain, and both macrophages and microglia exhibited an activated phenotype. Microarray analyses of leukocytes in the infected Mavs −/− brain showed a preferential expression of genes associated with activation and inflammation. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for MAVS in hematopoietic cells in augmenting the kinetics of WNV clearance and thereby preventing a dysregulated and pathogenic immune response. IMPORTANCE West Nile virus (WNV) is the most important cause of mosquito-transmitted encephalitis in the United States. The innate immune response is known to be critical for protection in infected mice. Here, we show that expression of MAVS, a key adaptor molecule in the RIG-I-like receptor RNA-sensing pathway, in hematopoietic cells is critical for protection from lethal WNV infection. In the absence of MAVS, there is a massive infiltration of myeloid cells and virus-specific T cells into the brain and overexuberant production of proinflammatory cytokines. These results demonstrate the important role that MAVS expression in hematopoietic cells has in regulating the inflammatory response in the WNV-infected brain.

TI  - MITD1 is a brain-specific interferon-inducible factor that inhibits flavivirus replication.
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 122
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are closely related mosquito-borne neurotropic flaviviruses that share common transmission cycle and can infect humans. However, while human infections by WNV are widespread, infections by USUV are comparatively less frequent, less severe, and currently limited to Africa and Europe. To identify human host factors that contribute to the pathogenic signatures of these two flaviviruses, we carried out an arrayed expression screen of over 1,300 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several ISGs known to target flaviviruses, including IFI6, SHFL, and RTP4 were among the strongest hits. Interestingly, we also found MITD1, an ISG with no previously reported antiviral activity, among the strongest hits. We demonstrated that the antiviral activity of MITD1 was not limited to USUV and WNV, since it also inhibited Zika and dengue virus replication. We found MITD1 to interfere with viral RNA replication by sequestering specific endosomal sorting complexes required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) proteins involved in the formation of viral replication factories. MITD1 expression was not increased by type I interferon (IFN-I) in most human cells and mouse tissues that we examined, although WNV and USUV replication was strongly inhibited by IFN-I. Strikingly, MITD1 was induced in the brain of USUV-infected mice and importantly, in human monocyte-derived microglia. Using human microglial-like cells, we confirmed that MITD1 is an essential mediator of the anti-flavivirus activity of IFN-I in these cells. We conclude that MITD1 plays a key role in the cellular defenses against neurotropic flaviviruses.

TI  - MKRN1 Induces Degradation of West Nile Virus Capsid Protein by Functioning as an E3 Ligase
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 426
EP  - 436
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus capsid protein (WNVCp) displays pathogenic toxicity via the apoptotic pathway. However, a cellular mechanism protective against this toxic effect has not been observed so far. Here, we identified Makorin ring finger protein 1 (MKRN1) as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase for WNVCp. The cytotoxic effects of WNVCp as well as its expression levels were inhibited in U2OS cells that stably expressed MKRN1. Immunoprecipitation analyses revealed an interaction between MKRN1 and WNVCp. Domain analysis indicated that the C terminus of MKRN1 and the N terminus of WNVCp were required for the interaction. MKRN1 could induce WNVCp ubiquitination and degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Interestingly, the WNVCp mutant with amino acids 1 to 105 deleted WNVCp was degraded by MKRN1, whereas the mutant with amino acids 1 to 90 deleted was not. When three lysine sites at positions 101, 103, and 104 of WNVCp were replaced with alanine, MKRN1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of the mutant were significantly inhibited, suggesting that these sites are required for the ubiquitination. Finally, U2OS cell lines stably expressing MKRN1 were resistant to cytotoxic effects of WNV. In contrast, cells depleted of MKRN1 were more susceptible to WNVCp cytotoxicity. Confirming this, overexpression of MKRN1 significantly reduced, but depletion of MKRN1 increased, WNV proliferation in 293T cells. Taken together, our results suggest that MKRN1 can protect cells from WNV by inducing WNVCp degradation.

VL  - 189 4
SP  - 658
EP  - 68
AB  - Type 1 interferon (IFN) receptor gene knockout (IFNAR(-/-)) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) are more susceptible to and productive of West Nile virus (WNV) and produce less type 1 IFN than WNV-infected wild-type (wt) MEFs. WNV infection of IFNAR(-/-) MEFs induced activation of a p65/p50 heterodimer of nuclear factor (NF)- kappa B and up-regulation of cell-surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules. WNV infection of wt MEFs resulted in a greater up-regulation of MHC-I than did infection of IFNAR(-/-) MEFs because of the action of endogenous type 1 IFN production. IFN- beta -treatment of wt MEFs did not activate NF- kappa B but did up-regulate cell-surface MHC-I expression. The WNV-induced NF- kappa B activation was partially abrogated by the serine protease inhibitor N-benzoyl-l-tosyl-l-phenylalanine, which also abrogated the up-regulation of MHC-I. Thus, we demonstrate 2 pathways for WNV-induced up-regulation of MHC-I, a WNV-induced NF- kappa B-dependent, IFN-independent pathway and an NF- kappa B-independent, IFN-dependent pathway.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 73

EP  - 9567
AB  - ABSTRACT Replication of the flavivirus Kunjin virus is associated with virus-induced membrane structures within the cytoplasm of infected cells; these membranes appear as packets of vesicles associated with the sites of viral RNA synthesis and as convoluted membranes (CM) and paracrystalline arrays (PC) containing the components of the virus-specified protease (E. G. Westaway, J. M. Mackenzie, M. T. Kenney, M. K. Jones, and A. A. Khromykh, J. Virol. 71:6650–6661, 1997). To determine the cellular origins of these membrane structures, we compared the immunolabelling patterns of several cell markers in relation to these sites by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. A marker for the trans-Golgi membranes and the trans-Golgi network, 1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalT), was redistributed to large foci in the cytoplasm of Kunjin virus-infected cells, partially coincident with immunofluorescent foci associated with the putative sites of viral RNA synthesis. As determined by immunoelectron microscopy, the induced vesicle packets contained GalT, whereas the CM and PC contained a specific protein marker for the intermediate compartment (ERGIC53). A further indicator of the role of cellular organelles in their biogenesis was the observation that the Golgi apparatus-disrupting agent brefeldin A prevented further development of immunofluorescent foci of induced membranes if added before the end of the latent period but that once formed, these membrane foci were resistant to brefeldin A dispersion. Reticulum membranes emanating from the induced CM and PC were also labelled with the rough endoplasmic reticulum marker anti-protein disulfide isomerase and were obviously redistributed during infection. This is the first report identifyingtrans-Golgi membranes and the intermediate compartment as the apparent sources of the flavivirus-induced membranes involved in events of replication.

TI  - Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 Facilitates West Nile Virus Entry into the Brain
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 8978
EP  - 8985
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is the most-common cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis in the United States. Invasion of the brain by WNV is influenced by viral and host factors, and the molecular mechanism underlying disruption of the blood-brain barrier is likely multifactorial. Here we show that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) is involved in WNV entry into the brain by enhancing blood-brain barrier permeability. Murine MMP9 expression was induced in the circulation shortly after WNV infection, and the protein levels remained high even when viremia subsided. In the murine brain, MMP9 expression and its enzymatic activity were upregulated and MMP9 was shown to partly localize to the blood vessels. Interestingly, we also found that cerebrospinal fluid from patients suffering from WNV contained increased MMP9 levels. The peripheral viremia and expression of host cytokines were not altered in MMP9−/− mice; however, these animals were protected from lethal WNV challenge. The resistance of MMP9−/− mice to WNV infection correlated with an intact blood-brain barrier since immunoglobulin G, Evans blue leakage into brain, and type IV collagen degradation were markedly reduced in the MMP9−/− mice compared with their levels in controls. Consistent with this, the brain viral loads, selected inflammatory cytokines, and leukocyte infiltrates were significantly reduced in the MMP9−/− mice compared to their levels in wild-type mice. These data suggest that MMP9 plays a role in mediating WNV entry into the central nervous system and that strategies to interrupt this process may influence the course of West Nile encephalitis.

Recent experiments have shown a dominant role of the IFN-α/β response in protection against lethal West Nile virus (WNV) by limiting the cellular and tissue tropism of infection. This review will focus on advances in identifying the host sensors that detect WNV and the adaptor molecules and signaling pathways that regulate the induction of IFN-α/β defenses that limit WNV replication, spread and pathogenesis.

TI  - Mechanism of Immune Evasion in Mosquito-Borne Diseases
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - In recent decades, mosquito-borne illnesses have emerged as a major health burden in many tropical regions. These diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever, Zika virus infection, Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile virus infection, are transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes. These pathogens have been shown to interfere with the host’s immune system through adaptive and innate immune mechanisms, as well as the human circulatory system. Crucial immune checkpoints such as antigen presentation, T cell activation, differentiation, and proinflammatory response play a vital role in the host cell’s response to pathogenic infection. Furthermore, these immune evasions have the potential to stimulate the human immune system, resulting in other associated non-communicable diseases. This review aims to advance our understanding of mosquito-borne diseases and the immune evasion mechanisms by associated pathogens. Moreover, it highlights the adverse outcomes of mosquito-borne disease.

TI  - Mechanism of West Nile Virus Neuroinvasion: A Critical Appraisal
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 6
SP  - 2796
EP  - 2825
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an important emerging neurotropic virus, responsible for increasingly severe encephalitis outbreaks in humans and horses worldwide. However, the mechanism by which the virus gains entry to the brain (neuroinvasion) remains poorly understood. Hypotheses of hematogenous and transneural entry have been proposed for WNV neuroinvasion, which revolve mainly around the concepts of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and retrograde axonal transport, respectively. However, an over‑representation of in vitro studies without adequate in vivo validation continues to obscure our understanding of the mechanism(s). Furthermore, WNV infection in the current rodent models does not generate a similar viremia and character of CNS infection, as seen in the common target hosts, humans and horses. These differences ultimately question the applicability of rodent models for pathogenesis investigations. Finally, the role of several barriers against CNS insults, such as the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the CSF-brain and the blood-spinal cord barriers, remain largely unexplored, highlighting the infancy of this field. In this review, a systematic and critical appraisal of the current evidence relevant to the possible mechanism(s) of WNV neuroinvasion is conducted.

TI  - Membrane Retention of West Nile Virus NS5 Depends on NS1 or NS3 for Enzymatic Activity
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) possesses multiple enzymatic domains essential for viral RNA replication. During infection, NS5 predominantly localizes to unique replication organelles (ROs) at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), known as vesicle packets (VPs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), with a portion of NS5 accumulating in the nucleus. NS5 is a soluble protein that must be in the VP, where its enzymatic activities are required for viral RNA synthesis. However, the mechanistic processes behind the recruitment of NS5 from the cytoplasm to the RER membrane remain unclear. Here, we utilize high-resolution confocal microscopy and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation to investigate whether the association of NS5 with other NS proteins contributes to its membrane recruitment and retention. We demonstrate that NS1 or NS3 partially influences the NS5 association with the membrane. We further demonstrate that processed NS5 is predominantly in the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating that the processing of NS5 from the viral polyprotein does not contribute to its membrane localization. These observations suggest that other host or viral factors, such as the enwrapment of NS5 by the RO, may also be necessary for the complete membrane retention of NS5. Therefore, studies on the inhibitors that disrupt the membrane localization of WNV NS5 are warranted for antiviral drug development.

TI  - Meta-Transcriptomic Comparison of the RNA Viromes of the Mosquito Vectors Culex pipiens and Culex torrentium in Northern Europe
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - There is mounting evidence that mosquitoes harbour an extensive diversity of ‘insect-specific’ RNA viruses in addition to those important to human and animal health. However, because most studies of the mosquito virome have been conducted at lower latitudes there is a major knowledge gap on the genetic diversity, evolutionary history, and spread of RNA viruses sampled from mosquitoes in northern latitudes. Here, we determined and compared the RNA virome of two common northern Culex mosquito species, Cx. pipiens and Cx. torrentium, known vectors of West Nile virus and Sindbis virus, respectively, collected in south-central Sweden. Following bulk RNA-sequencing (meta-transcriptomics) of 12 libraries, comprising 120 specimens of Cx. pipiens and 150 specimens of Cx. torrentium, we identified 40 viruses (representing 14 virus families) of which 28 were novel based on phylogenetic analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein. Hence, we found similar levels of virome diversity as in mosquitoes sampled from the more biodiverse lower latitudes. Four libraries, all from Cx. torrentium, had a significantly higher abundance of viral reads, spanning ∼7– 36% of the total amount of reads. Many of these viruses were also related to those sampled on other continents, indicative of widespread global movement and/or long host-virus co-evolution. Importantly, although the two mosquito species investigated have overlapping geographical distributions and share many viruses, approximately one quarter of the viruses were only found at a specific location, such that geography must play an important role in shaping the diversity of RNA viruses in Culex mosquitoes. Importance RNA viruses are found in all domains of life and all global habitats. However, the factors that determine virome composition and structure within and between organisms are largely unknown. Herein, we characterised RNA virus diversity in two common mosquito vector species, Culex pipiens and Culex torrentium, sampled from northern Europe. Our analysis revealed extensive viral diversity, including 28 novel viruses, and was comparable to the levels of diversity found in other temperate and tropical regions globally. Importantly, as well as harbouring RNA viruses that are closely related to other mosquito-derived viruses sampled in diverse global locations, we also described a number of viruses that are unique to specific sampling locations in Sweden. Hence, these data showed that geographical factors can play an important role in shaping virome structure even at local scales.

TI  - Metabolic response to CNS infection with flaviviruses
JF  - Journal of Neuroinflammation
VL  - 20
AB  - Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne RNA viruses found worldwide that, when introduced into the human body, cause diseases, including neuroinfections, that can lead to serious metabolic consequences and even death. Some of the diseases caused by flaviviruses occur continuously in certain regions, while others occur intermittently or sporadically, causing epidemics. Some of the most common flaviviruses are West Nile virus, dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus. Since all the above-mentioned viruses are capable of penetrating the blood–brain barrier through different mechanisms, their actions also affect the central nervous system (CNS). Like other viruses, flaviviruses, after entering the human body, contribute to redox imbalance and, consequently, to oxidative stress, which promotes inflammation in skin cells, in the blood and in CNS. This review focuses on discussing the effects of oxidative stress and inflammation resulting from pathogen invasion on the metabolic antiviral response of the host, and the ability of viruses to evade the consequences of metabolic changes or exploit them for increased replication and further progression of infection, which affects the development of sequelae and difficulties in therapy.

TI  - MicroRNA Expression Prior to Biting in a Vector Mosquito Anticipates Physiological Processes Related to Energy Utilization, Reproduction and Immunity
JF  - Insects
VL  - 14
AB  - Simple Summary Mosquitoes are able to transmit a wide variety of devastating pathogens when they bite and obtain blood from their vertebrate hosts. Therefore, identifying the physiological processes required for biting by vector mosquitoes can contribute to developing strategies to suppress biting behavior and prevent disease transmission. In this study, we investigate the differential expression of small regulatory RNAs (microRNAs) between different strains of the Northern house mosquito, Culex pipiens, which is a major vector of West Nile virus and filarial nematodes. We measured differential microRNA expression specifically in the context of a behavioral biting assay, using populations with previously documented differences in biting propensity and the ability to produce eggs without a blood meal. We identified eight differentially expressed microRNAs; six of these are implicated in regulating physiological processes related to energy utilization, reproduction, and immunity. Our results are strikingly similar to previous studies demonstrating increased expression of messenger RNA-encoding proteins involved in energy utilization in association with biting. Furthermore, while previous studies have identified changes in microRNA expression occurring after consuming a blood meal, ours is the first study to demonstrate anticipatory changes in microRNA expression before blood is consumed. Abstract Understanding the molecular and physiological processes underlying biting behavior in vector mosquitoes has important implications for developing novel strategies to suppress disease transmission. Here, we conduct small-RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR to identify differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in the head tissues of two subspecies of Culex pipiens that differ in biting behavior and the ability to produce eggs without blood feeding. We identified eight differentially expressed miRNAs between biting C. pipiens pipiens (Pipiens) and non-biting C. pipiens molestus (Molestus); six of these miRNAs have validated functions or predicted targets related to energy utilization (miR8-5-p, miR-283, miR-2952-3p, miR-1891), reproduction (miR-1891), and immunity (miR-2934-3p, miR-92a, miR8-5-p). Although miRNAs regulating physiological processes associated with blood feeding have previously been shown to be differentially expressed in response to a blood meal, our results are the first to demonstrate differential miRNA expression in anticipation of a blood meal before blood is actually imbibed. We compare our current miRNA results to three previous studies of differential messenger RNA expression in the head tissues of mosquitoes. Taken together, the combined results consistently show that biting mosquitoes commit to specific physiological processes in anticipation of a blood meal, while non-biting mosquitoes mitigate these anticipatory costs.

TI  - Modelling Wolbachia infection in a sex-structured mosquito population carrying West Nile virus
JF  - Journal of Mathematical Biology
VL  - 75
SP  - 621
EP  - 647
AB  - Wolbachia is possibly the most studied reproductive parasite of arthropod species. It appears to be a promising candidate for biocontrol of some mosquito borne diseases. We begin by developing a sex-structured model for a Wolbachia infected mosquito population. Our model incorporates the key effects of Wolbachia infection including cytoplasmic incompatibility and male killing. We also allow the possibility of reduced reproductive output, incomplete maternal transmission, and different mortality rates for uninfected/infected male/female individuals. We study the existence and local stability of equilibria, including the biologically relevant and interesting boundary equilibria. For some biologically relevant parameter regimes there may be multiple coexistence steady states including, very importantly, a coexistence steady state in which Wolbachia infected individuals dominate. We also extend the model to incorporate West Nile virus (WNv) dynamics, using an SEI modelling approach. Recent evidence suggests that a particular strain of Wolbachia infection significantly reduces WNv replication in Aedes aegypti. We model this via increased time spent in the WNv-exposed compartment for Wolbachia infected female mosquitoes. A basic reproduction number R0\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$R_0$$\end{document} is computed for the WNv infection. Our results suggest that, if the mosquito population consists mainly of Wolbachia infected individuals, WNv eradication is likely if WNv replication in Wolbachia infected individuals is sufficiently reduced.

TI  - Modification of the Host Cell Lipid Metabolism Induced by Hypolipidemic Drugs Targeting the Acetyl Coenzyme A Carboxylase Impairs West Nile Virus Replication
JF  - Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy
VL  - 60
SP  - 307
EP  - 315
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes that causes meningitis and encephalitis in humans, horses, and birds. Several studies have highlighted that flavivirus infection is highly dependent on cellular lipids for virus replication and infectious particle biogenesis. The first steps of lipid synthesis involve the carboxylation of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) to malonyl-CoA that is catalyzed by the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). This makes ACC a key enzyme of lipid synthesis that is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic target for different disorders, including cancers, obesity, diabetes, and viral infections. We have analyzed the effect of the ACC inhibitor 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA) on infection by WNV. Lipidomic analysis of TOFA-treated cells confirmed that this drug reduced the cellular content of multiple lipids, including those directly implicated in the flavivirus life cycle (glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol). Treatment with TOFA significantly inhibited the multiplication of WNV in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis of the antiviral effect of this drug showed that the inhibitory effect was related to a reduction of viral replication. Furthermore, treatment with another ACC inhibitor, 3,3,14,14-tetramethylhexadecanedioic acid (MEDICA 16), also inhibited WNV infection. Interestingly, TOFA and MEDICA 16 also reduced the multiplication of Usutu virus (USUV), a WNV-related flavivirus. These results point to the ACC as a druggable cellular target suitable for antiviral development against WNV and other flaviviruses.

TI  - Molecular Determinants of Tissue Specificity of Flavivirus Nonstructural Protein 1 Interaction with Endothelial Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - Flavivirus NS1 is secreted into the bloodstream from infected cells during a viral infection. Dengue virus NS1 contributes to severe dengue pathology such as endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak independently of the virus. ABSTRACT Members of the mosquito-borne flavivirus genus such as dengue (DENV), West Nile (WNV), and Zika (ZIKV) viruses cause distinct diseases and affect different tissues. We previously found that the secreted flaviviral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) interacts with endothelial cells and disrupts endothelial barrier function in a tissue-specific manner consistent with the disease tropism of the respective viruses. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this tissue-specific NS1-endothelial cell interaction is not well understood. To elucidate the distinct role(s) that the wing and β-ladder domains of NS1 play in NS1 interactions with endothelial cells, we constructed flavivirus NS1 chimeras that exchanged the wing and β-ladder domains in a pairwise manner between DENV, WNV, and ZIKV NS1. We found that both the NS1 wing and β-ladder domains conferred NS1 tissue-specific endothelial dysfunction, with the wing conferring cell binding and the β-ladder involved in inducing endothelial hyperpermeability as measured by transendothelial electrical resistance. To narrow down the amino acids dictating cell binding specificity, we utilized the DENV-WNV NS1 chimera and identified residues 91 to 93 (GDI) of DENV NS1 as a molecular motif determining binding specificity. Further, using an in vivo mouse model of localized leak, we found that the GDI motif of the wing domain was essential for triggering DENV NS1-induced vascular leak in mouse dermis. Taken together, we identify molecular determinants of flavivirus NS1 that confer NS1 binding and vascular leak and highlight the importance of the NS1 wing domain for flavivirus pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Flavivirus NS1 is secreted into the bloodstream from infected cells during a viral infection. Dengue virus NS1 contributes to severe dengue pathology such as endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak independently of the virus. We have shown that multiple flavivirus NS1 proteins result in endothelial dysfunction in a tissue-specific manner consistent with their respective viral tropism. Here, we aimed to identify the molecular determinants that make some, but not other, flavivirus NS1 proteins bind to select endothelial cells in vitro and cause vascular leak in a mouse model. We identified the wing domain of NS1 as a primary determinant conferring differential endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak and narrowed the contributing amino acid residues to a three-residue motif within the wing domain. The insights from this study pave the way for future studies on the effects of flavivirus NS1 on viral dissemination and pathogenesis and offer potential new avenues for antiviral therapies.

TI  - Molecular Determinants of West Nile Virus Virulence and Pathogenesis in Vertebrate and Invertebrate Hosts
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 21
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV), like the dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV), are major arboviruses belonging to the Flavivirus genus. WNV is emerging or endemic in many countries around the world, affecting humans and other vertebrates. Since 1999, it has been considered to be a major public and veterinary health problem, causing diverse pathologies, ranging from a mild febrile state to severe neurological damage and death. WNV is transmitted in a bird–mosquito–bird cycle, and can occasionally infect humans and horses, both highly susceptible to the virus but considered dead-end hosts. Many studies have investigated the molecular determinants of WNV virulence, mainly with the ultimate objective of guiding vaccine development. Several vaccines are used in horses in different parts of the world, but there are no licensed WNV vaccines for humans, suggesting the need for greater understanding of the molecular determinants of virulence and antigenicity in different hosts. Owing to technical and economic considerations, WNV virulence factors have essentially been studied in rodent models, and the results cannot always be transported to mosquito vectors or to avian hosts. In this review, the known molecular determinants of WNV virulence, according to invertebrate (mosquitoes) or vertebrate hosts (mammalian and avian), are presented and discussed. This overview will highlight the differences and similarities found between WNV hosts and models, to provide a foundation for the prediction and anticipation of WNV re-emergence and its risk of global spread.

VL  - 13
AB  - Flaviviruses are vector-borne RNA viruses, many of which are clinically relevant human viral pathogens, such as dengue, Zika, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile and yellow fever viruses. Millions of people are infected with these viruses around the world each year. Vaccines are only available for some members of this large virus family, and there are no effective antiviral drugs to treat flavivirus infections. The unmet need for vaccines and therapies against these flaviviral infections drives research towards a better understanding of the epidemiology, biology and immunology of flaviviruses. In this review, we discuss the basic biology of the flavivirus replication process and focus on the molecular aspects of viral genome replication. Within the virus-induced intracellular membranous compartments, flaviviral RNA genome replication takes place, starting from viral poly protein expression and processing to the assembly of the virus RNA replication complex, followed by the delivery of the progeny viral RNA to the viral particle assembly sites. We attempt to update the latest understanding of the key molecular events during this process and highlight knowledge gaps for future studies.

TI  - Molecular Mechanisms of Flaviviral Membrane Fusion
JF  - West Nile Encephalitis Virus Infection
SP  - 265
EP  - 286
AB  - Enveloped viruses rely on transmembrane fusion proteins to fuse the viral membrane to the host-cell membrane and deliver the viral genome into the cytoplasm for replication. Although the structures and evolutionary origins of viral fusion proteins vary widely, all fusion proteins use the same physical principles and topology to drive membrane fusion. First, exposure of a hydrophobic fusion anchor allows them to insert into the host-cell membrane. Conserved hydrophobic residues in the fusion anchor penetrate part way into the outer bilayer leaflet of the host-cell membrane. The fusion protein then folds back on itself, directing the C-terminal viral transmembrane anchor toward the fusion loop. This fold-back forces the host-cell membrane (held by the fusion loop) and the viral membrane (held by the C-terminal transmembrane anchor) against one another until they fuse. In West Nile virus and other flaviviruses this fold-back in the fusion protein, E, is triggered by the reduced pH of an endosome, is accompanied by the assembly of E monomers into trimers, and occurs by domain rearrangement rather than by an extensive refolding of secondary structure. The rearrangement releases a large amount of energy, which is used to exert a bending force on the apposed viral and cellular membranes, propelling them toward each other and, eventually, causing them to fuse. The conserved regions of E that are responsible for driving membrane fusion are attractive targets for antiviral therapies.

TI  - Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms Underlying Neurologic Manifestations of Mosquito-Borne Flavivirus Infections
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Flaviviruses are a family of enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome, transmitted by arthropod vectors. These viruses are known for their broad cellular tropism leading to infection of multiple body systems, which can include the central nervous system. Neurologic effects of flavivirus infection can arise during both acute and post-acute infectious periods; however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying post-acute sequelae are not fully understood. Here, we review recent studies that have examined molecular and cellular mechanisms that may contribute to neurologic sequelae following infection with the West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Zika virus, dengue virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus. Neuronal death, either from direct infection or due to the resultant inflammatory response, is a common mechanism by which flavivirus infection can lead to neurologic impairment. Other types of cellular damage, such as oxidative stress and DNA damage, appear to be more specific to certain viruses. This article aims to highlight mechanisms of cellular damage that are common across several flavivirus members and mechanisms that are more unique to specific members. Our goal is to inspire further research to improve understanding of this area in the hope of identifying treatment options for flavivirus-associated neurologic changes.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 77
SP  - 7804
EP  - 7813
AB  - ABSTRACT A number of full-length cDNA clones of Kunjin virus (KUN) were previously prepared; it was shown that two of them, pAKUN and FLSDX, differed in specific infectivities of corresponding in vitro transcribed RNAs by ∼100,000-fold (A. A. Khromykh et al., J. Virol. 72:7270-7279, 1998). In this study, we analyzed a possible genetic determinant(s) of the observed differences in infectivity initially by sequencing the entire cDNAs of both clones and comparing them with the published sequence of the parental KUN strain MRM61C. We found six common amino acid residues in both cDNA clones that were different from those in the published MRM61C sequence but were similar to those in the published sequences of other flaviviruses from the same subgroup. pAKUN clone had four additional codon changes, i.e., Ile59 to Asn and Arg175 to Lys in NS2A and Tyr518 to His and Ser557 to Pro in NS3. Three of these substitutions except the previously shown marker mutation, Arg175 to Lys in NS2A, reverted to the wild-type sequence in the virus eventually recovered from pAKUN RNA-transfected BHK cells, demonstrating the functional importance of these residues in viral replication and/or viral assembly. Exchange of corresponding DNA fragments between pAKUN and FLSDX clones and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the Tyr518-to-His mutation in NS3 was responsible for an ∼5-fold decrease in specific infectivity of transcribed RNA, while the Ile59-to-Asn mutation in NS2A completely blocked virus production. Correction of the Asn59 in pAKUN NS2A to the wild-type Ile residue resulted in complete restoration of RNA infectivity. Replication of KUN replicon RNA with an Ile59-to-Asn substitution in NS2A and with a Ser557-to-Pro substitution in NS3 was not affected, while the Tyr518-to-His substitution in NS3 led to severe inhibition of RNA replication. The impaired function of the mutated NS2A in production of infectious virus was complemented in trans by the helper wild-type NS2A produced from the KUN replicon RNA. However, replicon RNA with mutated NS2A could not be packaged in trans by the KUN structural proteins. The data demonstrated essential roles for the KUN nonstructural protein NS2A in virus assembly and for NS3 in RNA replication and identified specific single-amino-acid residues involved in these functions.

TI  - Mosquito Microbiome Dynamics, a Background for Prevalence and Seasonality of West Nile Virus
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - Symbiotic microbial communities augment host phenotype, including defense against pathogen carriage and infection. We sampled the microbial communities in 11 adult mosquito host species from six regions in southern Ontario, Canada over 3 years. Of the factors examined, we found that mosquito species was the largest driver of the microbiota, with remarkable phylosymbiosis between host and microbiota. Seasonal shifts of the microbiome were consistently repeated over the 3-year period, while region had little impact. Both host species and seasonal shifts in microbiota were associated with patterns of West Nile virus (WNV) in these mosquitoes. The highest prevalence of WNV, with a seasonal spike each year in August, was in the Culex pipiens/restuans complex, and high WNV prevalence followed a decrease in relative abundance of Wolbachia in this species. Indeed, mean temperature, but not precipitation, was significantly correlated with Wolbachia abundance. This suggests that at higher temperatures Wolbachia abundance is reduced leading to greater susceptibility to WNV in the subsequent generation of C. pipiens/restuans hosts. Different mosquito genera harbored significantly different bacterial communities, and presence or abundance of Wolbachia was primarily associated with these differences. We identified several operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Wolbachia that drive overall microbial community differentiation among mosquito taxa, locations and timepoints. Distinct Wolbachia OTUs were consistently found to dominate microbiomes of Cx. pipiens/restuans, and of Coquilletidia perturbans. Seasonal fluctuations of several other microbial taxa included Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus, Methylobacterium, Asaia, Pantoea, Acinetobacter johnsonii, Pseudomonas, and Mycoplasma. This suggests that microbiota may explain some of the variation in vector competence previously attributed to local environmental processes, especially because Wolbachia is known to affect carriage of viral pathogens.

TI  - Mosquito Saliva Causes Enhancement of West Nile Virus Infection in Mice
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85

EP  - 1527
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is transmitted to vertebrate hosts primarily by infected Culex mosquitoes. Transmission of arboviruses by the bite of infected mosquitoes can potentiate infection in hosts compared to viral infection by needle inoculation. Here we examined the effect of mosquito transmission on WNV infection and systematically investigated multiple factors that differ between mosquito infection and needle inoculation of WNV. We found that mice infected with WNV through the bite of a single infected Culex tarsalis mosquito exhibited 5- to 10-fold-higher viremia and tissue titers at 24 and 48 h postinoculation and faster neuroinvasion than mice given a median mosquito-inoculated dose of WNV (105 PFU) by needle. Mosquito-induced enhancement was not due to differences in inoculation location, because additional intravenous inoculation of WNV did not enhance viremia or tissue titers. Inoculation of WNV into a location where uninfected mosquitoes had fed resulted in enhanced viremia and tissue titers in mice similar to those in mice infected by a single infected mosquito bite, suggesting that differences in where virus is deposited in the skin and in the virus particle itself were not responsible for the enhanced early infection in mosquito-infected mice. In addition, inoculation of mice with WNV mixed with salivary gland extract (SGE) led to higher viremia, demonstrating that mosquito saliva is the major cause of mosquito-induced enhancement. Enhanced viremia was not observed when SGE was inoculated at a distal site, suggesting that SGE enhances WNV replication by exerting a local effect. Furthermore, enhancement of WNV infection still occurred in mice with antibodies against mosquito saliva. In conclusion, saliva from C. tarsalis is responsible for enhancement of early WNV infection in vertebrate hosts.

TI  - Mosquito Salivary Proteins and Arbovirus Infection: From Viral Enhancers to Potential Targets for Vaccines
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses present important public health challenges worldwide. Viruses such as DENV, ZIKV, and WNV are of current concern due to an increasing incidence and an expanding geographic range, generating explosive outbreaks even in non-endemic areas. The clinical signs associated with infection from these arboviruses are often inapparent, mild, or nonspecific, but occasionally develop into serious complications marked by rapid onset, tremors, paralysis, hemorrhagic fever, neurological alterations, or death. They are predominately transmitted to humans through mosquito bite, during which saliva is inoculated into the skin to facilitate blood feeding. A new approach to prevent arboviral diseases has been proposed by the observation that arthropod saliva facilitates transmission of pathogens. Viruses released within mosquito saliva may more easily initiate host invasion by taking advantage of the host’s innate and adaptive immune responses to saliva. This provides a rationale for creating vaccines against mosquito salivary proteins, especially because of the lack of licensed vaccines against most of these viruses. This review aims to provide an overview of the effects on the host immune response by the mosquito salivary proteins and how these phenomena alter the infection outcome for different arboviruses, recent attempts to generate mosquito salivary-based vaccines against flavivirus including DENV, ZIKV, and WNV, and the potential benefits and pitfalls that this strategy involves.

TI  - Mosquito Small RNA Responses to West Nile and Insect-Specific Virus Infections in Aedes and Culex Mosquito Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - Small RNA mediated responses are essential for antiviral defence in mosquitoes, however, they appear to differ per virus-vector combination. To further investigate the diversity of small RNA responses against viruses in mosquitoes, we applied a small RNA deep sequencing approach on five mosquito cell lines: Culex tarsalis CT cells, Aedes albopictus U4.4 and C6/36 cells, Ae. aegypti Aag2 cells (cleared from cell fusing agent virus and Culex Y virus (CYV) by repetitive dsRNA transfections) and Ae. pseudoscutellaris AP-61 cells. De novo assembly of small RNAs revealed the presence of Phasi Charoen-like virus (PCLV), Calbertado virus, Flock House virus and a novel narnavirus in CT cells, CYV in U4.4 cells, and PCLV in Aag2 cells, whereas no insect-specific viruses (ISVs) were detected in C6/36 and AP-61 cells. Next, we investigated the small RNA responses to the identified ISVs and to acute infection with the arthropod-borne West Nile virus (WNV). We demonstrate that AP-61 and C6/36 cells do not produce siRNAs to WNV infection, suggesting that AP-61, like C6/36, are Dicer-2 deficient. CT cells produced a strong siRNA response to the persistent ISVs and acute WNV infection. Interestingly, CT cells also produced viral PIWI-interacting (pi)RNAs to PCLV, but not to WNV or any of the other ISVs. In contrast, in U4.4 and Aag2 cells, WNV siRNAs, and pi-like RNAs without typical ping-pong piRNA signature were observed, while this signature was present in PCLV piRNAs in Aag2 cells. Together, our results demonstrate that mosquito small RNA responses are strongly dependent on both the mosquito cell type and/or the mosquito species and family of the infecting virus.

TI  - Mosquito antiviral defense mechanisms: a delicate balance between innate immunity and persistent viral infection
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 12
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases are associated with major global health burdens. Aedes spp. and Culex spp. are primarily responsible for the transmission of the most medically important mosquito-borne viruses, including dengue virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus. Despite the burden of these pathogens on human populations, the interactions between viruses and their mosquito hosts remain enigmatic. Viruses enter the midgut of a mosquito following the mosquito’s ingestion of a viremic blood meal. During infection, virus recognition by the mosquito host triggers their antiviral defense mechanism. Of these host defenses, activation of the RNAi pathway is the main antiviral mechanism, leading to the degradation of viral RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication and promoting viral clearance. However, whilst antiviral host defense mechanisms limit viral replication, the mosquito immune system is unable to effectively clear the virus. As such, these viruses can establish persistent infection with little or no fitness cost to the mosquito vector, ensuring life-long transmission to humans. Understanding of the mosquito innate immune response enables the discovery of novel antivectorial strategies to block human transmission. This review provides an updated and concise summary of recent studies on mosquito antiviral immune responses, which is a key determinant for successful virus transmission. In addition, we will also discuss the factors that may contribute to persistent infection in mosquito hosts. Finally, we will discuss current mosquito transmission-blocking strategies that utilize genetically modified mosquitoes and Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes for resistance to pathogens.

TI  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses and type I interferon: catch me if you can!
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 14
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses include many viruses that are important human pathogens, including Yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, Zika virus and West Nile virus. While these viruses have long been confined to tropical regions, they now pose a global public health concern, as the geographical distribution of their mosquito vectors has dramatically expanded. The constant threat of flavivirus emergence and re-emergence underlines the need for a better understanding of the relationships between these viruses and their hosts. In particular, unraveling how these viruses manage to bypass antiviral immune mechanisms could enable the design of countermeasures to limit their impact on human health. The body’s first line of defense against viral infections is provided by the interferon (IFN) response. This antiviral defense mechanism takes place in two waves, namely the induction of type I IFNs triggered by viral infection, followed by the IFN signaling pathway, which leads to the synthesis of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), whose products inhibit viral replication. In order to spread throughout the body, viruses must race against time to replicate before this IFN-induced antiviral state hinders their dissemination. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge on the multiple strategies developed by mosquito-borne flaviviruses to interfere with innate immune detection and signaling pathways, in order to delay, if not prevent, the establishment of an antiviral response.

TI  - Mosquitoes Inoculate High Doses of West Nile Virus as They Probe and Feed on Live Hosts
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 3
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is transmitted to vertebrate hosts by mosquitoes as they take a blood meal. The amount of WNV inoculated by mosquitoes as they feed on a live host is not known. Previous estimates of the amount of WNV inoculated by mosquitoes (101.2–104.3 PFU) were based on in vitro assays that do not allow mosquitoes to probe or feed naturally. Here, we developed an in vivo assay to determine the amount of WNV inoculated by mosquitoes as they probe and feed on peripheral tissues of a mouse or chick. Using our assay, we recovered approximately one-third of a known amount of virus inoculated into mouse tissues. Accounting for unrecovered virus, mean and median doses of WNV inoculated by four mosquito species were 104.3 PFU and 105.0 PFU for Culex tarsalis, 105.9 PFU and 106.1 PFU for Cx. pipiens, 104.7 PFU and 104.7 PFU for Aedes japonicus, and 103.6 PFU and 103.4 PFU for Ae. triseriatus. In a direct comparison, in vivo estimates of the viral dose inoculated by Cx. tarsalis were approximately 600 times greater than estimates obtained by an in vitro capillary tube transmission assay. Virus did not disperse rapidly, as >99% of the virus was recovered from the section fed or probed upon by the mosquito. Furthermore, 76% (22/29) of mosquitoes inoculated a small amount of virus (∼102 PFU) directly into the blood while feeding. Direct introduction of virus into the blood may alter viral tropism, lead to earlier development of viremia, and cause low rates of infection in co-feeding mosquitoes. Our data demonstrate that mosquitoes inoculate high doses of WNV extravascularly and low doses intravascularly while probing and feeding on a live host. Accurate estimates of the viral dose inoculated by mosquitoes are critical in order to administer appropriate inoculation doses to animals in vaccine, host competence, and pathogenesis studies.

TI  - Motif-VI loop acts as a nucleotide valve in the West Nile Virus NS3 Helicase
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 52
SP  - 7447
EP  - 7464
AB  - Abstract The Orthoflavivirus NS3 helicase (NS3h) is crucial in virus replication, representing a potential drug target for pathogenesis. NS3h utilizes nucleotide triphosphate (ATP) for hydrolysis energy to translocate on single-stranded nucleic acids, which is an important step in the unwinding of double-stranded nucleic acids. Intermediate states along the ATP hydrolysis cycle and conformational changes between these states, represent important yet difficult-to-identify targets for potential inhibitors. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations of West Nile virus NS3h+ssRNA in the apo, ATP, ADP+Pi and ADP bound states were used to model the conformational ensembles along this cycle. Energetic and structural clustering analyses depict a clear trend of differential enthalpic affinity of NS3h with ADP, demonstrating a probable mechanism of hydrolysis turnover regulated by the motif-VI loop (MVIL). Based on these results, MVIL mutants (D471L, D471N and D471E) were found to have a substantial reduction in ATPase activity and RNA replication compared to the wild-type. Simulations of the mutants in the apo state indicate a shift in MVIL populations favoring either a closed or open ‘valve’ conformation, affecting ATP entry or stabilization, respectively. Combining our molecular modeling with experimental evidence highlights a conformation-dependent role for MVIL as a ‘valve’ for the ATP-pocket, presenting a promising target for antiviral development.

VL  - 89 Pt 4
SP  - 1010
EP  - 4
AB  - The flavivirus NS2B/NS3 protease has received considerable attention as a target for the development of antiviral compounds. While substrate based inhibitors have been the primary focus to date, an approach focussing on NS2B cofactor displacement could prove to be an effective alternative. To understand better the role of the NS2B cofactor in protease activation, we conducted an alanine mutagenesis screen throughout the 42-residue central cofactor domain (NS2B(51-92)) of West Nile virus (WNV). Two sites critical for proteolytic activity were identified (NS2B(59-62) and NS2B(75-87)), where the majority of substitutions were found to significantly decrease proteolytic activity of a recombinant WNV NS2B/NS3 protease. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the structural and functional role that the cofactor may play in the substrate-bound and free protease complexes as well as providing novel sites for targeting new antiviral inhibitors.

TI  - Mutation of Mapped TIA-1/TIAR Binding Sites in the 3′ Terminal Stem-Loop of West Nile Virus Minus-Strand RNA in an Infectious Clone Negatively Affects Genomic RNA Amplification
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 10657
EP  - 10670
AB  - ABSTRACT Previous data showed that the cellular proteins TIA-1 and TIAR bound specifically to the West Nile virus 3′ minus-strand stem-loop [WNV3′(−)SL] RNA (37) and colocalized with flavivirus replication complexes in WNV- and dengue virus-infected cells (21). In the present study, the sites on the WNV3′(−)SL RNA required for efficient in vitro T-cell intracellular antigen-related (TIAR) and T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) protein binding were mapped to short AU sequences (UAAUU) located in two internal loops of the WNV3′(−)SL RNA structure. Infectious clone RNAs with all or most of the binding site nucleotides in one of the 3′ (−)SL loops deleted or substituted did not produce detectable virus after transfection or subsequent passage. With one exception, deletion/mutation of a single terminal nucleotide in one of the binding sequences had little effect on the efficiency of protein binding or virus production, but mutation of a nucleotide in the middle of a binding sequence reduced both the in vitro protein binding efficiency and virus production. Plaque size, intracellular genomic RNA levels, and virus production progressively decreased with decreasing in vitro TIAR/TIA-1 binding activity, but the translation efficiency of the various mutant RNAs was similar to that of the parental RNA. Several of the mutant RNAs that inefficiently interacted with TIAR/TIA-1 in vitro rapidly reverted in vivo, indicating that they could replicate at a low level and suggesting that an interaction between TIAR/TIA-1 and the viral 3′(−)SL RNA is not required for initial low-level symmetric RNA replication but instead facilitates the subsequent asymmetric amplification of genome RNA from the minus-strand template.

TI  - N-Linked Glycosylation of West Nile Virus Envelope Proteins Influences Particle Assembly and Infectivity
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 13262
EP  - 13274
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) encodes two envelope proteins, premembrane (prM) and envelope (E). While the prM protein of all WNV strains contains a single N-linked glycosylation site, not all strains contain an N-linked site in the E protein. The presence of N-linked glycosylation on flavivirus E proteins has been linked to virus production, pH sensitivity, and neuroinvasiveness. Therefore, we examined the impact of prM and E glycosylation on WNV assembly and infectivity. Similar to other flaviviruses, expression of WNV prM and E resulted in the release of subviral particles (SVPs). Removing the prM glycosylation site in a lineage I or II strain decreased SVP release, as did removal of the glycosylation site in a lineage I E protein. Addition of the E protein glycosylation site in a lineage II strain that lacked this site increased SVP production. Similar results were obtained in the context of either reporter virus particles (RVPs) or infectious lineage II WNV. RVPs or virions bearing combinations of glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms of prM and E could infect mammalian, avian, and mosquito cells (BHK-21, QT6, and C6/36, respectively). Those particles lacking glycosylation on the E protein were modestly more infectious per genome copy on BHK-21 and QT6 cells, while this absence greatly enhanced the infection of C6/36 cells. Thus, glycosylation of WNV prM and E proteins can affect the efficiency of virus release and infection in a manner that is cell type and perhaps species dependent. This suggests a multifaceted role for envelope N-linked glycosylation in WNV biology and tropism.

TI  - N-linked glycosylation of the West Nile virus envelope protein is not a requisite for avian virulence or vector competence
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 13
AB  - The N-linked glycosylation motif at amino acid position 154–156 of the envelope (E) protein of West Nile virus (WNV) is linked to enhanced murine neuroinvasiveness, avian pathogenicity and vector competence. Naturally occurring isolates with altered E protein glycosylation patterns have been observed in WNV isolates; however, the specific effects of these polymorphisms on avian host pathogenesis and vector competence have not been investigated before. In the present study, amino acid polymorphisms, NYT, NYP, NYF, SYP, SYS, KYS and deletion (A’DEL), were reverse engineered into a parental WNV (NYS) cDNA infectious clone to generate WNV glycosylation mutant viruses. These WNV glycosylation mutant viruses were characterized for in vitro growth, pH-sensitivity, temperature-sensitivity and host competence in American crows (AMCR), house sparrows (HOSP) and Culex quinquefasciatus. The NYS and NYT glycosylated viruses showed higher viral replication, and lower pH and temperature sensitivity than NYP, NYF, SYP, SYS, KYS and A’DEL viruses in vitro. Interestingly, in vivo results demonstrated asymmetric effects in avian and mosquito competence that were independent of the E-protein glycosylation status. In AMCRs and HOSPs, all viruses showed comparable viremias with the exception of NYP and KYS viruses that showed attenuated phenotypes. Only NYP showed reduced vector competence in both Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. tarsalis. Glycosylated NYT exhibited similar avian virulence properties as NYS, but resulted in higher mosquito oral infectivity than glycosylated NYS and nonglycosylated, NYP, NYF, SYP and KYS mutants. These data demonstrated that amino acid polymorphisms at E154/156 dictate differential avian host and vector competence phenotypes independent of E-protein glycosylation status.

TI  - NKp44 Receptor Mediates Interaction of the Envelope Glycoproteins from the West Nile and Dengue Viruses with NK Cells1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 183
SP  - 2610
EP  - 2621
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) and West Nile virus (WNV) have become a global concern due to their widespread distribution and their ability to cause a variety of human diseases. Antiviral immune defenses involve NK cells. In the present study, we investigated the interaction between NK cells and these two flaviviruses. We show that the NK-activating receptor NKp44 is involved in virally mediated NK activation through direct interaction with the flavivirus envelope protein. Recombinant NKp44 directly binds to purified DV and WNV envelope proteins and specifically to domain III of WNV envelope protein; it also binds to WNV virus-like particles. These WNV-virus-like particles and WNV-domain III of WNV envelope protein directly bind NK cells expressing high levels of NKp44. Functionally, interaction of NK cells with infective and inactivated WNV results in NKp44-mediated NK degranulation. Finally, WNV infection of cells results in increased binding of rNKp44 that is specifically inhibited by anti-WNV serum. WNV-infected target cells induce IFN-γ secretion and augmented lysis by NKp44-expressing primary NK cells that are blocked by anti-NKp44 Abs. Our findings show that triggering of NK cells by flavivirus is mediated by interaction of NKp44 with the flavivirus envelope protein.

TI  - NMR Analysis of the Dynamic Exchange of the NS2B Cofactor between Open and Closed Conformations of the West Nile Virus NS2B-NS3 Protease
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 3
AB  - Background The two-component NS2B-NS3 proteases of West Nile and dengue viruses are essential for viral replication and established targets for drug development. In all crystal structures of the proteases to date, the NS2B cofactor is located far from the substrate binding site (open conformation) in the absence of inhibitor and lining the substrate binding site (closed conformation) in the presence of an inhibitor. Methods In this work, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of isotope and spin-labeled samples of the West Nile virus protease was used to investigate the occurrence of equilibria between open and closed conformations in solution. Findings In solution, the closed form of the West Nile virus protease is the predominant conformation irrespective of the presence or absence of inhibitors. Nonetheless, dissociation of the C-terminal part of the NS2B cofactor from the NS3 protease (open conformation) occurs in both the presence and the absence of inhibitors. Low-molecular-weight inhibitors can shift the conformational exchange equilibria so that over 90% of the West Nile virus protease molecules assume the closed conformation. The West Nile virus protease differs from the dengue virus protease, where the open conformation is the predominant form in the absence of inhibitors. Conclusion Partial dissociation of NS2B from NS3 has implications for the way in which the NS3 protease can be positioned with respect to the host cell membrane when NS2B is membrane associated via N- and C-terminal segments present in the polyprotein. In the case of the West Nile virus protease, discovery of low-molecular-weight inhibitors that act by breaking the association of the NS2B cofactor with the NS3 protease is impeded by the natural affinity of the cofactor to the NS3 protease. The same strategy can be more successful in the case of the dengue virus NS2B-NS3 protease.

TI  - NS1 Protein Secretion during the Acute Phase of West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 13924
EP  - 13933
AB  - ABSTRACT The West Nile virus (WNV) nonstructural protein NS1 is a protein of unknown function that is found within, associated with, and secreted from infected cells. We systematically investigated the kinetics of NS1 secretion in vitro and in vivo to determine the potential use of this protein as a diagnostic marker and to analyze NS1 secretion in relation to the infection cycle. A sensitive antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of WNV NS1 (polyclonal-ACE) was developed, as well as a capture ELISA for the specific detection of NS1 multimers (4G4-ACE). The 4G4-ACE detected native NS1 antigens at high sensitivity, whereas the polyclonal-ACE had a higher specificity for recombinant forms of the protein. Applying these assays we found that only a small fraction of intracellular NS1 is secreted and that secretion of NS1 in tissue culture is delayed compared to the release of virus particles. In experimentally infected hamsters, NS1 was detected in the serum between days 3 and 8 postinfection, peaking on day 5, the day prior to the onset of clinical disease; immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were detected at low levels on day 5 postinfection. Although real-time PCR gave the earliest indication of infection (day 1), the diagnostic performance of the 4G4-ACE was comparable to that of real-time PCR during the time period when NS1 was secreted. Moreover, the 4G4-ACE was found to be superior in performance to both the IgM and plaque assays during this time period, suggesting that NS1 is a viable early diagnostic marker of WNV infection.

EP  - 9390
AB  - ABSTRACT NS1′ is a C-terminally extended form of the NS1 protein produced only by encephalitic flaviviruses from the Japanese encephalitis virus serogroup. Here we show that West Nile virus (WNV) NS1′ and NS1 localize to the same cellular compartments when expressed from plasmid DNAs and also colocalize to viral RNA replication sites in infected cells. Using complementation analysis with NS1-deleted WNV cDNA, we demonstrated that NS1′ is able to substitute for the crucial function of NS1 in virus replication.

TI  - NS1′ of Flaviviruses in the Japanese Encephalitis Virus Serogroup Is a Product of Ribosomal Frameshifting and Plays a Role in Viral Neuroinvasiveness
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 1641
EP  - 1647
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus NS1 is a nonstructural protein involved in virus replication and regulation of the innate immune response. Interestingly, a larger NS1-related protein, NS1′, is often detected during infection with the members of the Japanese encephalitis virus serogroup of flaviviruses. However, how NS1′ is made and what role it performs in the viral life cycle have not been determined. Here we provide experimental evidence that NS1′ is the product of a −1 ribosomal frameshift event that occurs at a conserved slippery heptanucleotide motif located near the beginning of the NS2A gene and is stimulated by a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure. Using site-directed mutagenesis of these sequence elements in an infectious clone of the Kunjin subtype of West Nile virus, we demonstrate that NS1′ plays a role in viral neuroinvasiveness.

VL  - 90 Pt 9
SP  - 2081
EP  - 5
AB  - Using constructs that encode the individual West Nile virus (WNV) NS3helicase (NS3hel) and NS3hel linked to the hydrophilic, N-terminal 1-50 sequence of NS4A, we demonstrated that the presence of NS4A allows NS3hel to conserve energy in the course of oligonucleotide substrate unwinding. Using NS4A mutants, we also determined that the C-terminal acidic EELPD/E motif of NS4A, which appears to be functionally similar to the acidic EFDEMEE motif of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS4A, is essential for regulating the ATPase activity of NS3hel. We concluded that, similar to HCV NS4A, NS4A of WNV acts as a cofactor for NS3hel and allows helicase to sustain the unwinding rate of the viral RNA under conditions of ATP deficiency.

JF  - Virology
VL  - 258 1
SP  - 108
EP  - 17
AB  - Incorporation of bromouridine (BrU) into viral RNA in Kunjin virus-infected Vero cells treated with actinomycin D was monitored in situ by immunofluorescence using antibodies reactive with Br-RNA. The results showed unequivocally that nascent viral RNA was located focally in the same subcellular site as dsRNA, the putative template for flavivirus RNA synthesis. When cells were labeled with BrU for 15 min, the estimated cycle period for RNA synthesis, the nascent Br-RNA was not digested in permeabilized cells by RNase A under high-salt conditions, in accord with our original model of flavivirus RNA synthesis (Chu, P. W. G., and Westaway, E. G., Virology 140, 68-79, 1985). The model assumes that there is on average only one nascent strand per template, which remains bound until displaced during the next cycle of RNA synthesis. The replicase complex located by BrU incorporation in the identified foci was stable, remaining active in incorporating BrU or [32P]orthophosphate in viral RNA after complete inhibition of protein synthesis in cycloheximide-treated cells. These results are in accord with our proposal that dsRNA detected in foci previously located by immunofluorescence or by immunogold labeling of induced vesicle packets is functioning as the true replicative intermediate (Westaway et al., J. Virol. 71, 6650-6661, 1997; Mackenzie et al., Virology 245, 203-215, 1998). Implications are that the replicase complex is able to recycle in the same membrane site in the absence of continuing protein synthesis and that possibly apart from uncleaved NS3-NS4A, it has no requirement for a polyprotein precursor late in infection.

TI  - Native Wolbachia infection and larval competition stress shape fitness and West Nile virus infection in Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 14
AB  - Introduction Wolbachia transinfections established in key mosquito vectors, including Aedes aegypti are typically associated with pathogen blocking—reduced susceptibility to infection with key pathogens and reduced likelihood those pathogens are transmitted to new hosts. Host-symbiont-virus interactions are less well understood in mosquitoes like Culex quinquefasciatus, which naturally harbor Wolbachia, with pathogen blocking observed in some populations but not others, potentially due to innate differences in their Wolbachia load. In nature, mosquito larvae are often subject to developmental stresses associated with larval competition, which can lead to reduced body size and differential susceptibility to arbovirus infection. Methods In this study, we sought to understand whether competition stress and Wolbachia infection in Cx. quinquefasciatus combine to impact host fitness and susceptibility to infection with West Nile virus. We reared Wolbachia-infected and uninfected Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae under three competition stress levels, increasing larval density without increasing the amount of food supplied. We then monitored larval development and survival, measured wing length and quantified Wolbachia density in adults, and then challenged mosquitoes from each treatment group orally with West Nile virus. Results and Discussion We observed that high competition stress extended development time, decreased the likelihood of eclosion, decreased body size, and increased susceptibility to West Nile virus (WNV) infection. We also observed that Wolbachia infection reduced WNV load under low competition stress, and significantly improved the rate of survival for larval reared under higher competition stress. Consequently, our data suggest that native Wolbachia infection in Cx. quinquefasciatus has differential consequences for host fitness and susceptibility to WNV infection depending on competition stress.

TI  - Neuroinvasive Flavivirus Pathogenesis Is Restricted by Host Genetic Factors in Collaborative Cross Mice, Independently of Oas1b
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 97
AB  - Neuroinvasive flaviviruses, such as WNV, JEV, and POWV, are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes or ticks and can cause neurologic diseases, such as encephalitis, meningitis, and paralysis, and they can result in death or long-term sequelae. Although potentially severe, neuroinvasive disease is a rare outcome of flavivirus infection. ABSTRACT Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging tick-borne flavivirus that causes neuroinvasive diseases, including encephalitis, meningitis, and paralysis. Similar to other neuroinvasive flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), POWV disease presentation is heterogeneous, and the factors influencing disease outcome are not fully understood. We used Collaborative Cross (CC) mice to assess the impact of host genetic factors on POWV pathogenesis. We infected a panel of Oas1b-null CC lines with POWV and observed a range of susceptibility, indicating that host factors other than the well-characterized flavivirus restriction factor Oas1b modulate POWV pathogenesis in CC mice. Among the Oas1b-null CC lines, we identified multiple highly susceptible lines (0% survival), including CC071 and CC015, and two resistant lines, CC045 and CC057 (>75% survival). The susceptibility phenotypes generally were concordant among neuroinvasive flaviviruses, although we did identify one line, CC006, that was specifically resistant to JEV, suggesting that both pan-flavivirus and virus-specific mechanisms contribute to susceptibility phenotypes in CC mice. We found that POWV replication was restricted in bone marrow-derived macrophages from CC045 and CC057 mice, suggesting that resistance could result from cell-intrinsic restriction of viral replication. Although serum viral loads at 2 days postinfection were equivalent between resistant and susceptible CC lines, clearance of POWV from the serum was significantly enhanced in CC045 mice. Furthermore, CC045 mice had significantly lower viral loads in the brain at 7 days postinfection than did CC071 mice, suggesting that reduced central nervous system (CNS) infection contributes to the resistant phenotype of CC045 mice. IMPORTANCE Neuroinvasive flaviviruses, such as WNV, JEV, and POWV, are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes or ticks and can cause neurologic diseases, such as encephalitis, meningitis, and paralysis, and they can result in death or long-term sequelae. Although potentially severe, neuroinvasive disease is a rare outcome of flavivirus infection. The factors that determine whether someone develops severe disease after a flavivirus infection are not fully understood, but host genetic differences in polymorphic antiviral response genes likely contribute to the outcome of infection. We evaluated a panel of genetically diverse mice and identified lines with distinct outcomes following infection with POWV. We found that resistance to POWV pathogenesis corresponded to reduced viral replication in macrophages, more rapid clearance of virus in peripheral tissues, and reduced viral infection in the brain. These susceptible and resistant mouse lines will provide a system for investigating the pathogenic mechanisms of POWV and identifying polymorphic host genes that contribute to resistance.

TI  - Neuronal CXCL10 Directs CD8+ T-Cell Recruitment and Control of West Nile Virus Encephalitis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 11457
EP  - 11466
AB  - ABSTRACT The activation and entry of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells into the central nervous system is an essential step towards clearance of West Nile virus (WNV) from infected neurons. The molecular signals responsible for the directed migration of virus-specific T cells and their cellular sources are presently unknown. Here we demonstrate that in response to WNV infection, neurons secrete the chemokine CXCL10, which recruits effector T cells via the chemokine receptor CXCR3. Neutralization or a genetic deficiency of CXCL10 leads to a decrease in CXCR3+ CD8+ T-cell trafficking, an increase in viral burden in the brain, and enhanced morbidity and mortality. These data support a new paradigm in chemokine neurobiology, as neurons are not generally considered to generate antiviral immune responses, and CXCL10 may represent a novel neuroprotective agent in response to WNV infection in the central nervous system.

TI  - Noncoding Flavivirus RNA Displays RNA Interference Suppressor Activity in Insect and Mammalian Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 13486
EP  - 13500
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV) are highly pathogenic, mosquito-borne flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae) that cause severe disease and death in humans. WNV and DENV actively replicate in mosquitoes and human hosts and thus encounter different host immune responses. RNA interference (RNAi) is the predominant antiviral response against invading RNA viruses in insects and plants. As a countermeasure, plant and insect RNA viruses encode RNA silencing suppressor (RSS) proteins to block the generation/activity of small interfering RNA (siRNA). Enhanced flavivirus replication in mosquitoes depleted for RNAi factors suggests an important biological role for RNAi in restricting virus replication, but it has remained unclear whether or not flaviviruses counteract RNAi via expression of an RSS. First, we established that flaviviral RNA replication suppressed siRNA-induced gene silencing in WNV and DENV replicon-expressing cells. Next, we showed that none of the WNV encoded proteins displayed RSS activity in mammalian and insect cells and in plants by using robust RNAi suppressor assays. In contrast, we found that the 3′-untranslated region-derived RNA molecule known as subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) efficiently suppressed siRNA- and miRNA-induced RNAi pathways in both mammalian and insect cells. We also showed that WNV sfRNA inhibits in vitro cleavage of double-stranded RNA by Dicer. The results of the present study suggest a novel role for sfRNA, i.e., as a nucleic acid-based regulator of RNAi pathways, a strategy that may be conserved among flaviviruses.

TI  - Noncoding Subgenomic Flavivirus RNA Is Processed by the Mosquito RNA Interference Machinery and Determines West Nile Virus Transmission by Culex pipiens Mosquitoes
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 10145
EP  - 10159
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses, such as Zika virus, yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus (WNV), are a serious concern for human health. Flaviviruses produce an abundant noncoding subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) in infected cells. sfRNA results from stalling of the host 5′-3′ exoribonuclease XRN1/Pacman on conserved RNA structures in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genomic RNA. sfRNA production is conserved in insect-specific, mosquito-borne, and tick-borne flaviviruses and flaviviruses with no known vector, suggesting a pivotal role for sfRNA in the flavivirus life cycle. Here, we investigated the function of sfRNA during WNV infection of Culex pipiens mosquitoes and evaluated its role in determining vector competence. An sfRNA1-deficient WNV was generated that displayed growth kinetics similar to those of wild-type WNV in both RNA interference (RNAi)-competent and -compromised mosquito cell lines. Small-RNA deep sequencing of WNV-infected mosquitoes indicated an active small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based antiviral response for both the wild-type and sfRNA1-deficient viruses. Additionally, we provide the first evidence that sfRNA is an RNAi substrate in vivo. Two reproducible small-RNA hot spots within the 3′ UTR/sfRNA of the wild-type virus mapped to RNA stem-loops SL-III and 3′ SL, which stick out of the three-dimensional (3D) sfRNA structure model. Importantly, we demonstrate that sfRNA-deficient WNV displays significantly decreased infection and transmission rates in vivo when administered via the blood meal. Finally, we show that transmission and infection rates are not affected by sfRNA after intrathoracic injection, thereby identifying sfRNA as a key driver to overcome the mosquito midgut infection barrier. This is the first report to describe a key biological function of sfRNA for flavivirus infection of the arthropod vector, providing an explanation for the strict conservation of sfRNA production. IMPORTANCE Understanding the flavivirus transmission cycle is important to identify novel targets to interfere with disease and to aid development of virus control strategies. Flaviviruses produce an abundant noncoding viral RNA called sfRNA in both arthropod and mammalian cells. To evaluate the role of sfRNA in flavivirus transmission, we infected mosquitoes with the flavivirus West Nile virus and an sfRNA-deficient mutant West Nile virus. We demonstrate that sfRNA determines the infection and transmission rates of West Nile virus in Culex pipiens mosquitoes. Comparison of infection via the blood meal versus intrathoracic injection, which bypasses the midgut, revealed that sfRNA is important to overcome the mosquito midgut barrier. We also show that sfRNA is processed by the antiviral RNA interference machinery in mosquitoes. This is the first report to describe a pivotal biological function of sfRNA in arthropods. The results explain why sfRNA production is evolutionarily conserved.

TI  - Noncoding Subgenomic Flavivirus RNA: Multiple Functions in West Nile Virus Pathogenesis and Modulation of Host Responses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 6
SP  - 404

AB  - Flaviviruses are a large group of positive strand RNA viruses transmitted by arthropods that include many human pathogens such as West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. All members in this genus tested so far are shown to produce a unique subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) derived from the 3' untranslated region (UTR). sfRNA is a product of incomplete degradation of genomic RNA by the cell 5'–3' exoribonuclease XRN1 which stalls at highly ordered secondary RNA structures at the beginning of the 3'UTR. Generation of sfRNA results in inhibition of XRN1 activity leading to an increase in stability of many cellular mRNAs. Mutant WNV deficient in sfRNA generation was highly attenuated displaying a marked decrease in cytopathicity in cells and pathogenicity in mice. sfRNA has also been shown to inhibit the antiviral activity of IFN-α/β by yet unknown mechanism and of the RNAi pathway by likely serving as a decoy substrate for Dicer. Thus, sfRNA is involved in modulating multiple cellular pathways to facilitate viral pathogenicity; however the overlying mechanism linking all these multiple functions of sfRNA remains to be elucidated.

TI  - Nonconsensus West Nile Virus Genomes Arising during Mosquito Infection Suppress Pathogenesis and Modulate Virus Fitness In Vivo
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 12605
EP  - 12613
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is similar to other RNA viruses in that it forms genetically complex populations within hosts. The virus is maintained in nature in mosquitoes and birds, with each host type exerting distinct influences on virus populations. We previously observed that prolonged replication in mosquitoes led to increases in WNV genetic diversity and diminished pathogenesis in mice without remarkable changes to the consensus genome sequence. We therefore sought to evaluate the relationships between individual and group phenotypes in WNV and to discover novel viral determinants of pathogenesis in mice and fitness in mosquitoes and birds. Individual plaque size variants were isolated from a genetically complex population, and mutations conferring a small-plaque and mouse-attenuated phenotype were localized to the RNA helicase domain of the NS3 protein by reverse genetics. The mutation, an Asp deletion, did not alter type I interferon production in the host but rendered mutant viruses more susceptible to interferon compared to wild type (WT) WNV. Finally, we used an in vivo fitness assay in Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes and chickens to determine whether the mutation in NS3 influenced fitness. The fitness of the NS3 mutant was dramatically lower in chickens and moderately lower in mosquitoes, indicating that RNA helicase is a major fitness determinant of WNV and that the effect on fitness is host specific. Overall, this work highlights the complex relationships that exist between individual and group phenotypes in RNA viruses and identifies RNA helicase as an attenuation and fitness determinant in WNV.

TI  - Novel cis-Acting Element within the Capsid-Coding Region Enhances Flavivirus Viral-RNA Replication by Regulating Genome Cyclization
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 6804
EP  - 6818
AB  - ABSTRACT cis-Acting elements in the viral genome RNA (vRNA) are essential for the translation, replication, and/or encapsidation of RNA viruses. In this study, a novel conserved cis-acting element was identified in the capsid-coding region of mosquito-borne flavivirus. The downstream of 5′ cyclization sequence (5′CS) pseudoknot (DCS-PK) element has a three-stem pseudoknot structure, as demonstrated by structure prediction and biochemical analysis. Using dengue virus as a model, we show that DCS-PK enhances vRNA replication and that its function depends on its secondary structure and specific primary sequence. Mutagenesis revealed that the highly conserved stem 1 and loop 2, which are involved in potential loop-helix interactions, are crucial for DCS-PK function. A predicted loop 1-stem 3 base triple interaction is important for the structural stability and function of DCS-PK. Moreover, the function of DCS-PK depends on its position relative to the 5′CS, and the presence of DCS-PK facilitates the formation of 5′-3′ RNA complexes. Taken together, our results reveal that the cis-acting element DCS-PK enhances vRNA replication by regulating genome cyclization, and DCS-PK might interplay with other cis-acting elements to form a functional vRNA cyclization domain, thus playing critical roles during the flavivirus life cycle and evolution.

TI  - Nuclear Localization of Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 5 Through Its Importin α/β–Recognized Nuclear Localization Sequences is Integral to Viral Infection
JF  - Traffic
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is a large multifunctional protein with a central role in viral replication. We previously identified two nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) within the central region of dengue virus type‐2 (DENV‐2) NS5 (‘aNLS’ and ‘bNLS’) that are recognized by the importin α/β and importin β1 nuclear transporters, respectively. Here, we demonstrate the importance of the kinetics of NS5 nuclear localization to virus production for the first time and show that the aNLS is responsible. Site‐specific mutations in the bipartite‐type aNLS or bNLS region were introduced into a reporter plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein fused to the N‐terminus of DENV‐2 NS5, as well as into DENV‐2 genomic length complementary DNA. Mutation of basic residues in the highly conserved region of the bNLS did not affect nuclear import of NS5. In contrast, mutations in either basic cluster of the aNLS decreased NS5 nuclear accumulation and reduced virus production, with the greatest reduction observed for mutation of the second cluster (K387K388K389); mutagenesis of both clusters abolished NS5 nuclear import and DENV‐2 virus production completely. The latter appeared to relate to the impaired ability of virus lacking nuclear‐localizing NS5, as compared with wild‐type virus expressing nuclear‐localizing NS5, to reduce interleukin‐8 production as part of the antiviral response. The results overall indicate that NS5 nuclear localization through the aNLS is integral to viral infection, with significant implications for other flaviviruses of medical importance, such as yellow fever and West Nile viruses.

TI  - Nuclear Localization of Flavivirus RNA Synthesis in Infected Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 5451
EP  - 5464
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviral replication is believed to be exclusively cytoplasmic, occurring within virus-induced membrane-bound replication complexes in the host cytoplasm. Here we show that a significant proportion (20%) of the total RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity from cells infected with West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and dengue virus is resident within the nucleus. Consistent with this, the major replicase proteins NS3 and NS5 of JEV also localized within the nucleus. NS5 was found distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, but NS3 was present at sites of active flaviviral RNA synthesis, colocalizing with NS5, and visible as distinct foci along the inner periphery of the nucleus by confocal and immunoelectron microscopy. Both these viral replicase proteins were also present in the nuclear matrix, colocalizing with the peripheral lamina, and revealed a well-entrenched nuclear location for the viral replication complex. In keeping with this observation, antibodies to either NS3 or NS5 coimmunoprecipitated the other protein from isolated nuclei along with newly synthesized viral RNA. Taken together these data suggest an absolute requirement for both of the replicase proteins for nucleus-localized synthesis of flavivirus RNA. Thus, we conclusively demonstrate for the first time that the host cell nucleus functions as an additional site for the presence of functionally active flaviviral replicase complex.

TI  - Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the West Nile virus RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase NS5 is critical to infection
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 20
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a single‐stranded, positive sense RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae and is a significant pathogen of global medical importance. Flavivirus replication is known to be exclusively cytoplasmic, but we show here for the first time that access to the nucleus of the WNV strain Kunjin (WNVKUN) RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (protein NS5) is central to WNVKUN virus production. We show that treatment of cells with the specific nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) results in increased NS5 nuclear accumulation in WNVKUN‐infected cells and NS5‐transfected cells, indicative of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling under normal conditions. We used site‐directed mutagenesis to identify the nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) responsible for WNVKUN NS5 nuclear targeting, observing that mutation of this NLS resulted in exclusively cytoplasmic accumulation of NS5 even in the presence of leptomycin B. Introduction of NS5 NLS mutations into FLSDX, an infectious clone of WNVKUN, resulted in lethality, suggesting that the ability of NS5 to traffic into the nucleus in integral to WNVKUN replication. This study thus shows for the first time that NLS‐dependent trafficking into the nucleus during infection of WNVKUN NS5 is critical for viral replication. Excitingly, specific inhibitors of NS5 nuclear import reduce WNVKUN virus production, proving the principle that inhibition of WNVKUN NS5 nuclear import is a viable therapeutic avenue for antiviral drug development in the future.

JF  - Novartis Foundation symposium
VL  - 277

EP  - 45;discussion145-8,251-3
AB  - The organization of flaviviral replicase proteins within the membrane-bound replication complexes of West Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis viruses (JEV) was probed by investigating the combined effect of detergents and trypsin on both viral replicase activity and profile of metabolically labelled viral proteins. While trypsin treatment of virus-induced membrane fractions degraded the vast majority of replicase proteins, viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity remained completely unaffected. Solubilization of the membranes with deoxycholate (DOC) however rendered the replicase accessible to trypsin. Triton X-100 (TX100) treatment reduced RdRp activity by half in WNV but totally destroyed RdRp activity in JEV. TX100 also dissociated NS1' in addition to NS1 from NS5 and NS3 inJEV. Antibodies to NS3 coprecipitated NS1' along with NS5 only from DOC-solubilized but not from TX100-treated extracts, the former of which alone retained RdRp activity. Exogenous addition of recombinant NS1' to TX100 treated JEV-induced membranes restored the defect in the release step of RNA synthesis. Our results suggest for the first time a direct role for JEV NS1' in viral RNA synthesis in vitro.

JF  - Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA
VL  - 8
AB  - Flaviviruses, such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, are serious human pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality globally each year. Flaviviruses are single‐stranded, positive‐sense RNA viruses, and encode two multidomain proteins, NS3 and NS5, that possess all enzymatic activities required for genome replication and capping. NS3 and NS5 interact within virus‐induced replication compartments to form the RNA genome replicase complex. Although the individual enzymatic activities of both proteins have been extensively studied and are well characterized, there are still gaps in our understanding of how they interact to efficiently coordinate their respective activities during positive‐strand RNA synthesis and capping. Here, we discuss what is known about the structures and functions of the NS3 and NS5 proteins and propose a preliminary NS3:NS5:RNA interaction model based on a large body of literature about how the viral enzymes function, physical restraints between NS3 and NS5, as well as critical steps in the replication process.

TI  - Osteopontin Impacts West Nile virus Pathogenesis and Resistance by Regulating Inflammasome Components and Cell Death in the Central Nervous System at Early Time Points
JF  - Mediators of Inflammation
VL  - 2017
AB  - Osteopontin (OPN) is a molecule that is common in central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, which participates in the activation, migration, and survival of inflammatory cells. However, the mechanisms by which OPN modulates inflammatory pathways are not clear. To understand the role of OPN in CNS viral infections, we used a lethal mouse model of West Nile virus (WNV), characterized by the injection of high doses of the Eg101 strain of WNV, causing the increase of OPN levels in the brain since early time points. To measure the impact of OPN in neuropathogenesis and resistance, we compared C57BI/6 WT with mice lacking the OPN gene (OPN KO). OPN KO presented a significantly higher mortality compared to WT mice, detectable since day 5 pi. Our data suggests that OPN expression at early time points may provide protection against viral spread in the CNS by negatively controlling the type I IFN-sensitive, caspase 1-dependent inflammasome, while promoting an alternative caspase 8-associated pathway, to control the apoptosis of infected cells during WNV infection in the CNS. Overall, we conclude that the expression of OPN maintains a critical threshold in the innate immune response that controls apoptosis and lethal viral spread in early CNS infection.

TI  - PKR and RNase L Contribute to Protection against Lethal West Nile Virus Infection by Controlling Early Viral Spread in the Periphery and Replication in Neurons
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 7009
EP  - 7019
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic, mosquito-borne flavivirus that can cause lethal meningoencephalitis. Type I interferon (IFN) plays a critical role in controlling WNV replication, spread, and tropism. In this study, we begin to examine the effector mechanisms by which type I IFN inhibits WNV infection. Mice lacking both the interferon-induced, double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and the endoribonuclease of the 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L system (PKR−/− × RL−/−) were highly susceptible to subcutaneous WNV infection, with a 90% mortality rate compared to the 30% mortality rate observed in congenic wild-type mice. PKR−/− × RL−/− mice had increased viral loads in their draining lymph nodes, sera, and spleens, which led to early viral entry into the central nervous system (CNS) and higher viral burden in neuronal tissues. Although mice lacking RNase L showed a higher CNS viral burden and an increased mortality, they were less susceptible than the PKR−/− × RL−/− mice; thus, we also infer an antiviral role for PKR in the control of WNV infection. Notably, a deficiency in both PKR and RNase L resulted in a decreased ability of type I IFN to inhibit WNV in primary macrophages and cortical neurons. In contrast, the peripheral neurons of the superior cervical ganglia of PKR−/− × RL−/− mice showed no deficiency in the IFN-mediated inhibition of WNV. Our data suggest that PKR and RNase L contribute to IFN-mediated protection in a cell-restricted manner and control WNV infection in peripheral tissues and some neuronal subtypes.

TI  - PLNC8 αβ Potently Inhibits the Flavivirus Kunjin and Modulates Inflammatory and Intracellular Signaling Responses of Alveolar Epithelial Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - PLNC8 αβ is a cationic antimicrobial peptide that previously has been reported to express both antibacterial and antiviral properties. This study aimed to further elucidate the antiviral effects of PLNC8 αβ and its impact on virus-induced cytotoxicity and inflammatory signaling in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) infected with the flavivirus Kunjin. Complementary in silico analyses using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were conducted to investigate the mechanism of action of PLNC8 αβ by studying the interaction of PLNC8 α and β with models of a flavivirus membrane and a eukaryotic plasma membrane, respectively. Our findings demonstrated that PLNC8 αβ significantly reduces both extracellular and intracellular viral loads, as confirmed by plaque reduction assays and RT-PCR. The peptide also mitigated virus-induced cytotoxicity and inflammation. Notably, PLNC8 αβ modulated the virus-induced dysregulation of key signaling and inflammatory genes, such as TLR9, TLR3, NOD2, FOS, JUN, IL6, and CXCL8. MD simulation revealed that PLNC8 αβ exhibits higher binding affinity for a flavivirus membrane model compared to a model of the plasma membrane, likely due to stronger electrostatic interactions with anionic phospholipids. This selective interaction possibly accounts for a potent antiviral activity of PLNC8 αβ combined with a minimal cytotoxicity toward human cells. Overall, PLNC8 αβ shows significant promise as an antiviral agent against flavivirus infections and warrants further exploration for peptide-based antiviral therapies.

TI  - Pathogenesis and Inhibition of Flaviviruses from a Carbohydrate Perspective
JF  - Pharmaceuticals
VL  - 10
AB  - Flaviviruses are enveloped, positive single stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses with various routes of transmission. While the type and severity of symptoms caused by pathogenic flaviviruses vary from hemorrhagic fever to fetal abnormalities, their general mechanism of host cell entry is similar. All pathogenic flaviviruses, such as dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Zika virus, bind to glycosaminglycans (GAGs) through the putative GAG binding sites within their envelope proteins to gain access to the surface of host cells. GAGs are long, linear, anionic polysaccharides with a repeating disaccharide unit and are involved in many biological processes, such as cellular signaling, cell adhesion, and pathogenesis. Flavivirus envelope proteins are N-glycosylated surface proteins, which interact with C-type lectins, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) through their glycans. In this review, we discuss both host and viral surface receptors that have the carbohydrate components, focusing on the surface interactions in the early stage of flavivirus entry. GAG-flavivirus envelope protein interactions as well as interactions between flavivirus envelope proteins and DC-SIGN are discussed in detail. This review also examines natural and synthetic inhibitors of flaviviruses that are carbohydrate-based or carbohydrate-targeting. Both advantages and drawbacks of these inhibitors are explored, as are potential strategies to improve their efficacy to ultimately help eradicate flavivirus infections.

TI  - Pathogenomics of Culex quinquefasciatus and Meta-Analysis of Infection Responses to Diverse Pathogens
JF  - Science
VL  - 330
SP  - 88
EP  - 90
AB  - Closing the Vector Circle The genome sequence of Culex quinquefasciatus offers a representative of the third major genus of mosquito disease vectors for comparative analysis. In a major international effort, Arensburger et al. (p. 86) uncovered divergences in the C. quinquefasciatus genome compared with the representatives of the other two genera Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. The main difference noted is the expansion of numbers of genes, particularly for immunity, oxidoreductive functions, and digestive enzymes, which may reflect specific aspects of the Culex life cycle. Bartholomay et al. (p. 88) explored infection-response genes in Culex in more depth and uncovered 500 immune response-related genes, similar to the numbers seen in Aedes, but fewer than seen in Anopheles or the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The higher numbers of genes were attributed partly to expansions in those encoding serpins, C-type lectins, and fibrinogen-related proteins, consistent with greater immune surveillance and associated signaling needed to monitor the dangers of breeding in polluted, urbanized environments. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that inoculation with unfamiliar bacteria prompted strong immune responses in Culex. The worm and virus pathogens that the mosquitoes transmit naturally provoked little immune activation, however, suggesting that tolerance has evolved to any damage caused by replication of the pathogens in the insects. The genome of a third mosquito species reveals distinctions related to vector capacities and habitat preferences. The mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus poses a substantial threat to human and veterinary health as a primary vector of West Nile virus (WNV), the filarial worm Wuchereria bancrofti, and an avian malaria parasite. Comparative phylogenomics revealed an expanded canonical C. quinquefasciatus immune gene repertoire compared with those of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. Transcriptomic analysis of C. quinquefasciatus genes responsive to WNV, W. bancrofti, and non-native bacteria facilitated an unprecedented meta-analysis of 25 vector-pathogen interactions involving arboviruses, filarial worms, bacteria, and malaria parasites, revealing common and distinct responses to these pathogen types in three mosquito genera. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that mosquito-borne pathogens have evolved to evade innate immune responses in three vector mosquito species of major medical importance.

TI  - Pathways Exploited by Flaviviruses to Counteract the Blood-Brain Barrier and Invade the Central Nervous System
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Human infection by different flaviviruses may cause severe neurologic syndromes, through pathogenic mechanisms that are still largely unknown. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are believed to reach the central nervous system by a hematogenous route, upon crossing the blood-brain barrier. Although the disruption of BBB during flavivirus infection has been largely evidenced in experimental models, the relevance of BBB breakdown for virus entering the brain was not completely elucidated. In vitro models of BBB had demonstrated that these viruses replicated in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), which induced downregulation of tight junction proteins and increased the permeability of the barrier. Other reports demonstrated that infection of BMECs allowed the basolateral release of infectious particles, without a remarkable cytopathic effect, what might be sufficient for virus invasion. Virus replication and activation of other cells associated to the BBB, mostly astrocytes and microglia, were also reported to affect the endothelial barrier permeability. This event might occur simultaneously or after BMECs infection, being a secondary effect leading to BBB disruption. Importantly, activation of BMECs, astrocytes, and microglia by flaviviruses was associated to the expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators, which are believed to recruit leukocytes to the CNS. The leukocyte infiltrate could further mediate viral invasion through a Trojan horse mechanism and might contribute to BBB breakdown and to neurological alterations. This review discussed the previous studies regarding in vitro and in vivo models of JEV, WNV, ZIKV, YFV, DENV, and TBEV infection and addressed the pathways for BBB overcome and invasion of the CNS described for each virus infection, aiming to increment the knowledge and stimulate further discussion about the role of BBB in the neuropathogenesis of flavivirus infection.

TI  - Pattern Recognition Receptor MDA5 Modulates CD8+ T Cell-Dependent Clearance of West Nile Virus from the Central Nervous System
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 11401
EP  - 11415
AB  - ABSTRACT Many viruses induce type I interferon responses by activating cytoplasmic RNA sensors, including the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Although two members of the RLR family, RIG-I and MDA5, have been implicated in host control of virus infection, the relative role of each RLR in restricting pathogenesis in vivo remains unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated that MAVS, the adaptor central to RLR signaling, is required to trigger innate immune defenses and program adaptive immune responses, which together restrict West Nile virus (WNV) infection in vivo. In this study, we examined the specific contribution of MDA5 in controlling WNV in animals. MDA5 −/− mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility, as characterized by reduced survival and elevated viral burden in the central nervous system (CNS) at late times after infection, even though small effects on systemic type I interferon response or viral replication were observed in peripheral tissues. Intracranial inoculation studies and infection experiments with primary neurons ex vivo revealed that an absence of MDA5 did not impact viral infection in neurons directly. Rather, subtle defects were observed in CNS-specific CD8+ T cells in MDA5 −/− mice. Adoptive transfer into recipient MDA5 +/+ mice established that a non-cell-autonomous deficiency of MDA5 was associated with functional defects in CD8+ T cells, which resulted in a failure to clear WNV efficiently from CNS tissues. Our studies suggest that MDA5 in the immune priming environment shapes optimal CD8+ T cell activation and subsequent clearance of WNV from the CNS.

TI  - Peli1 facilitates virus replication and promotes neuroinflammation during West Nile virus infection
JF  - Journal of Clinical Investigation
VL  - 128
SP  - 4980–4991
EP  - 
AB  - The E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino 1 (Peli1) is a microglia-specific mediator of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Its role in neurotropic flavivirus infection is largely unknown. Here, we report that mice deficient in Peli1 (Peli1–/–) were more resistant to lethal West Nile virus (WNV) infection and exhibited reduced viral loads in tissues and attenuated brain inflammation. Peli1 mediates chemokine and proinflammatory cytokine production in microglia and promotes T cell and macrophage infiltration into the CNS. Unexpectedly, Peli1 was required for WNV entry and replication in mouse macrophages and mouse and human neurons and microglia. It was also highly expressed on WNV-infected neurons and adjacent inflammatory cells from postmortem patients who died of acute WNV encephalitis. WNV passaged in Peli1–/– macrophages or neurons induced a lower viral load and impaired activation in WT microglia and thereby reduced lethality in mice. Smaducin-6, which blocks interactions between Peli1 and IRAK1, RIP1, and IKK&egr;, did not inhibit WNV-triggered microglia activation. Collectively, our findings suggest a nonimmune regulatory role for Peli1 in promoting microglia activation during WNV infection and identify a potentially novel host factor for flavivirus cell entry and replication.

TI  - Pharmacological Inhibition of Protein Kinase C Reduces West Nile Virus Replication
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 10
AB  - Flaviviruses are relevant animal and human pathogens that include West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue virus, or Zika virus, among others. Currently, no licensed therapy is available to fight flaviviral infections. Protein kinases C (PKCs) constitute a family of multifunctional lipid-dependent isoenzymes that regulate a wide variety of cellular processes (apoptosis, differentiation, proliferation, cellular transformation, motility, adhesion, etc.) being currently considered at the front line of drug development for the treatment of diverse human disorders. PKCs have also been implicated in different steps during viral replication; however, nowadays, results regarding their role in flavivirus replication are controversial. Here we demonstrate that calphostin C and chelerythrine, two broad-PKC inhibitors that target conventional, novel and atypical PKCs, significantly inhibit WNV multiplication in cell culture without affecting cell viability. A reduction of viral yields was observed in treated cells when compared with mock-treated cells. Likewise, immunofluorescence detection of viral enveloped E protein was reduced in treated cells, as was the amount of viral RNA released to the supernatant, mainly in those treated with chelerythrine. On the other hand, two PKC inhibitors specific for conventional and novel isoforms (staurosporine and enzastaurine) did not show any significant effect in WNV multiplication. These results suggested that PKCs, more probably atypical PKCs, are likely involved in WNV multiplication, although both broad-spectrum tested drugs seem to act through different mechanisms, and point to them as potential antiviral candidates for WNV, as well as for other related flaviviruses.

TI  - Phospholipase A2 activity during the replication cycle of the flavivirus West Nile virus
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - Positive-sense RNA virus intracellular replication is intimately associated with membrane platforms that are derived from host organelles and comprised of distinct lipid composition. For flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus strain Kunjin virus (WNVKUN) we have observed that these membrane platforms are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and are rich in (at least) cholesterol. To extend these studies and identify the cellular lipids critical for WNVKUN replication we utilized a whole cell lipidomics approach and revealed an elevation in phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity to produce lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lyso-PChol). We observed that the PLA2 enzyme family is activated in WNVKUN-infected cells and the generated lyso-PChol lipid moieties are sequestered to the subcellular sites of viral replication. The requirement for lyso-PChol was confirmed using chemical inhibition of PLA2, where WNVKUN replication and production of infectious virus was duly affected in the presence of the inhibitors. Importantly, we could rescue chemical-induced inhibition with the exogenous addition of lyso-PChol species. Additionally, electron microscopy results indicate that lyso-PChol appears to contribute to the formation of the WNVKUN membranous replication complex (RC); particularly affecting the morphology and membrane curvature of vesicles comprising the RC. These results extend our current understanding of how flaviviruses manipulate lipid homeostasis to favour their own intracellular replication.

TI  - Potential Dual Role of West Nile Virus NS2B in Orchestrating NS3 Enzymatic Activity in Viral Replication
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) harbors the viral triphosphatase and helicase for viral RNA synthesis and, together with NS2B, constitutes the protease responsible for polyprotein processing. NS3 is a soluble protein, but it is localized to specialized compartments at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), where its enzymatic functions are essential for virus replication. However, the mechanistic details behind the recruitment of NS3 from the cytoplasm to the RER have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we employed immunofluorescence and biochemical assays to demonstrate that NS3, when expressed individually and when cleaved from the viral polyprotein, is localized exclusively to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, NS3 appeared to be peripherally recruited to the RER and proteolytically active when NS2B was provided in trans. Thus, we provide evidence for a potential additional role for NS2B in not only serving as the cofactor for the NS3 protease, but also in recruiting NS3 from the cytoplasm to the RER for proper enzymatic activity. Results from our study suggest that targeting the interaction between NS2B and NS3 in disrupting the NS3 ER localization may be an attractive avenue for antiviral drug discovery.

EP  - 9
AB  - Kunjin virus is a member of the Flavivirus genus and is an Australian variant of West Nile virus. The C-terminal domain of the Kunjin virus NS3 protein displays helicase activity. The protein is thought to separate daughter and template RNA strands, assisting the initiation of replication by unwinding RNA secondary structure in the 3' nontranslated region. Expression, purification and preliminary crystallographic characterization of the NS3 helicase domain are reported. It is shown that Kunjin virus helicase may adopt a dimeric assembly in absence of nucleic acids, oligomerization being a means to provide the helicases with multiple nucleic acid-binding capability, facilitating translocation along the RNA strands. Kunjin virus NS3 helicase domain is an attractive model for studying the molecular mechanisms of flavivirus replication, while simultaneously providing a new basis for the rational development of anti-flaviviral compounds.

TI  - Primary and Secondary Immune Responses During Sequential West Nile Virus and Japanese Encephalitis Virus Infections: A Dissertation
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) are closely related Flaviviruses that are important arthropod-borne human pathogens. Both of these viruses can cause encephalitis with significant morbidity and mortality after infection. Flaviviruses co-circulate in many areas of the world, which raises the risk for sequential infection between heterologous viruses. Sequential infection between dengue virus serotypes can lead to cross-protection, but in some cases, it leads to a severe outcome, dengue hemorrhagic fever. Previous work in hamsters and non-human primates demonstrated that prior JEV immunity protects against a lethal WNV infection. However, the ability of prior WNV immunity to protect against a lethal JEV infection has been inconclusive. WNVimmune hamsters were fully protected from JEV viremia, but in non-human primates, prior WNV-immunity only reduced disease severity, with symptoms of encephalitis still observed. These differences in cross-protection led to further investigation on the directionality as well as the underlying mechanisms for this phenomenon. Previous work in our lab found that JEV-immune C57BL/6J (B6) mice were fully protected against a lethal WNV infection, and JEV-immune CD4 and CD8 T cells were required for this cross-protection. In other mouse models, memory cross-reactive CD4 and CD8 T cell responses may induce protection or immunopathology upon secondary heterologous viral challenge. We

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 68
SP  - 5765
EP  - 5771
AB  - According to the existing model of flavivirus polyprotein processing, one of the cleavages in the amino-terminal part of the flavivirus polyprotein by host cell signalases results in formation of prM (precursor to one of the structural proteins, M) and the membrane-bound intracellular form of the viral capsid protein (Cint) retaining the prM signal sequence at its carboxy terminus. This hydrophobic anchor is subsequently removed by the viral protease, resulting in formation of the mature viral capsid protein found in virions (Cvir). We have prepared in vitro expression cassettes coding for both forms of the capsid protein, for the prM protein, for the C-prM precursor, and for the viral protease components of West Nile flavivirus and characterized their translation products. Using Cint and Cvir translation products as molecular markers, we have observed processing of the intracellular form of the West Nile capsid protein by the viral protease in vitro both upon cotranslation of the C-prM precursor and the viral protease-encoding cassette and by incubation of C-prM translation products with a detergent-solubilized extract of cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the active viral protease. The cleavage of Cint by the viral protease at the predicted dibasic site was verified by introduction of point mutations into the cleavage site and an adjacent region. These studies provide the first direct demonstration of processing of the intracellular form of the flavivirus capsid protein by the viral protease.

JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 10
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a human pathogen of significant medical importance with close to 40,000 cases of encephalitis and more than 1,600 deaths reported in the US alone since its first emergence in New York in 1999. Previous studies identified a motif in the beginning of non-structural gene NS2A of encephalitic flaviviruses including WNV which induces programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift (PRF) resulting in production of an additional NS protein NS1′. We have previously demonstrated that mutant WNV with abolished PRF was attenuated in mice. Here we have extended our previous observations by showing that PRF does not appear to have a significant role in virus replication, virion formation, and viral spread in several cell lines in vitro. However, we have also shown that PRF induces an over production of structural proteins over non-structural proteins in virus-infected cells and that mutation abolishing PRF is present in ∼11% of the wild type virus population. In vivo experiments in house sparrows using wild type and PRF mutant of New York 99 strain of WNV viruses showed some attenuation for the PRF mutant virus. Moreover, PRF mutant of Kunjin strain of WNV showed significant decrease compared to wild type virus infection in dissemination of the virus from the midgut through the haemocoel, and ultimately the capacity of infected mosquitoes to transmit virus. Thus our results demonstrate an important role for PRF in regulating expression of viral genes and consequently virus replication in avian and mosquito hosts.

VL  - 203
SP  - 1371
EP  - 1381
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) causes a severe infection of the central nervous system in several vertebrate animals including humans. Prior studies have shown that complement plays a critical role in controlling WNV infection in complement (C) 3−/− and complement receptor 1/2−/− mice. Here, we dissect the contributions of the individual complement activation pathways to the protection from WNV disease. Genetic deficiencies in C1q, C4, factor B, or factor D all resulted in increased mortality in mice, suggesting that all activation pathways function together to limit WNV spread. In the absence of alternative pathway complement activation, WNV disseminated into the central nervous system at earlier times and was associated with reduced CD8+ T cell responses yet near normal anti-WNV antibody profiles. Animals lacking the classical and lectin pathways had deficits in both B and T cell responses to WNV. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, C1q was required for productive infection in the spleen but not for development of adaptive immune responses after WNV infection. Our results suggest that individual pathways of complement activation control WNV infection by priming adaptive immune responses through distinct mechanisms.

AB  - Protein–protein interactions govern biological functions in cells, in the extracellular milieu, and at the border between cells and extracellular space. Viruses are small intracellular parasites and thus rely on protein interactions to produce progeny inside host cells and to spread from cell to cell. Usage of host proteins by viruses can have severe consequences e.g. apoptosis, metabolic disequilibria, or altered cell proliferation and mobility. Understanding protein interactions during virus infection can thus educate us on viral infection and pathogenesis mechanisms. Moreover, it has led to important clinical translations, including the development of new therapeutic and vaccination strategies. Here, we will discuss protein interactions of members of the Flaviviridae family, which are small enveloped RNA viruses. Dengue virus, Zika virus and hepatitis C virus belong to the most prominent human pathogenic Flaviviridae. With a genome of roughly ten kilobases encoding only ten viral proteins, Flaviviridae display intricate mechanisms to engage the host cell machinery for their purpose. In this review, we will highlight how dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus proteins engage host proteins and how this knowledge helps elucidate Flaviviridae infection. We will specifically address the protein composition of the virus particle as well as the protein interactions during virus entry, replication, particle assembly, and release from the host cell. Finally, we will give a perspective on future challenges in Flaviviridae interaction proteomics and why we believe these challenges should be met.

EP  - 41
AB  - The subcellular locations in infected Vero cells of Kunjin (KUN) virus core protein C and NS4B were analyzed by immunofluorescence (IF) and by immunoelectron microscopy using monospecific antibodies. Selection of appropriate fixation methods for IF showed that both proteins were associated at all times with perinuclear membranes spreading outward in a reticular pattern and they entered the nucleus late during the latent period. Subsequently NS4B was also dispersed through the nucleoplasm, while C appeared in the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm. These nuclear locations were confirmed by immunogold labeling of cryosections of infected cells at 24 hr postinfection. Labeling of NS4B in cryosections was especially enriched in the perinuclear membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. When C and NS4B were each expressed separately in stably transformed cell lines, both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization was observed by IF and confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. Thus the two proteins translocated to the nucleus independently of each other and of other viral proteins. Dual IF with antibodies to double-stranded RNA showed that cytoplasmic locations of C and NS4B were apparently associated in part with the sites of viral RNA synthesis which were resistant to solubilization by Triton X-100.

EP  - 279
AB  - West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is a human, equine, and avian pathogen. High-resolution two-dimensional differential-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was used to characterize protein expression in primary rat neurons and to examine the proteomic profiling to understand the pathogenesis of West-Nile-associated meningoencephalitis. Three pH ranges, 3–10, 4–7, and 5–6, were used to analyze the protein spots. The proteins are labeled with fluorescent dyes Cy3 and Cy5 before being separated on the basis of charge and size respectively on a two-dimensional platform. About 55 proteins showed altered expression levels. These were then subsequently digested and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis using peptide mass fingerprinting and database searching. These cellular proteins could represent distinct roles during infection related to apoptosis. Our findings show that two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry is a powerful approach that permits the identification of proteins whose expression was altered due to West Nile virus infection.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83

EP  - 12635
AB  - ABSTRACT Histidine residues have been hypothesized to function as sensors of environmental pH that can trigger the activity of viral fusion proteins. We investigated a requirement for histidine residues in the envelope (E) protein of West Nile virus during pH-dependent entry into cells. Each histidine was individually replaced with a nonionizable amino acid and tested functionally. In each instance, mutants capable of orchestrating pH-dependent infection were identified. These results do not support a requirement for any single histidine as a pH-sensing “switch,” and they suggest that additional features of the E protein are involved in triggering pH-dependent steps in the flavivirus life cycle.

TI  - Purification and Characterization of West Nile Virus Nucleoside Triphosphatase (NTPase)/Helicase: Evidence for Dissociation of the NTPase and Helicase Activities of the Enzyme
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 75
SP  - 3220
EP  - 3229
AB  - ABSTRACT The nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase)/helicase associated with nonstructural protein 3 of West Nile (WN) virus was purified from cell culture medium harvested from virus-infected Vero cells. The purification procedure included sequential chromatography on Superdex-200 and Reactive Red 120 columns, followed by a concentration step on an Ultrogel hydroxyapatite column. The nature of the purified protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using a WN virus-positive antiserum, determination of its NH2 terminus by microsequencing, and a binding assay with 5′-[14C]fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine. Under optimized reaction conditions the enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of ATP and the unwinding of the DNA duplex with k cat values of 133 and 5.5 × 10−3 s−1, respectively. Characterization of the NTPase activity of the WN virus enzyme revealed that optimum conditions with respect to the Mg2+requirement and the monovalent salt or polynucleotide response differed from those of other flavivirus NTPases. Initial kinetic studies demonstrated that the inhibition (or activation) of ATPase activity by ribavirin-5′-triphosphate is not directly related to changes in the helicase activity of the enzyme. Further analysis using guanine andO6-benzoylguanine derivatives revealed that the ATPase activity of WN virus NTPase/helicase may be modulated, i.e., increased or reduced, with no effect on the helicase activity of the enzyme. On the other hand the helicase activity could be modulated without changing the ATPase activity. Our observations show that the number of ATP hydrolysis events per unwinding cycle is not a constant value.

AB  - Both dengue and West Nile virus infections are an increasing risk to humans, not only in tropical and subtropical areas, but also in North America and parts of Europe. These viral infections are generally transmitted by mosquitoes, but may also be tick-borne. Infection usually results in mild flu-like symptoms, but can also cause encephalitis and fatalities. Approximately 2799 severe West Nile virus cases were reported this year in the United States, resulting in 102 fatalities. With this alarming increase in the number of West Nile virus infections in western countries and the fact that dengue virus already affects millions of people per year in tropical and subtropical climates, there is a real need for effective medicines. A possible therapeutic target to combat these viruses is the protease, which is essential for virus replication. In order to provide structural information to help to guide a lead identification and optimization program, crystallizations of the NS2B-NS3 protease complexes from both dengue and West Nile viruses have been initiated. Crystals that diffract to high resolution, suitable for three-dimensional structure determinations, have been obtained.

TI  - Quantifying the Specific Binding between West Nile Virus Envelope Domain III Protein and the Cellular Receptor αVβ3 Integrin*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 281
SP  - 1352
EP  - 1360
AB  - A previous study has illustrated that the αVβ3 integrin served as the functional receptor for West Nile virus (WNV) entry into cells. Domain III (DIII) of WNV envelope protein (E) was postulated to mediate virus binding to the cellular receptor. In this study, the specificity and affinity binding of WNV E DIII protein to αVβ3 integrin was confirmed with co-immunoprecipitation and receptor competition assay. Binding of WNV E DIII protein to αVβ3 integrin induced the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase that is required to mediate ligand-receptor internalization into cells. A novel platform was then developed using the atomic force microscopy to measure this specific binding force between WNV E DIII protein and the cellular receptor, αVβ3 integrin. The single protein pair-interacting force measured was in the range of 45 ± 5 piconewtons. This interacting force was highly specific as minimal force was measured in the WNV E DIII protein interaction with αVβ5 integrin molecules and heparan sulfate. These experiments provided an insight to quantitate virus-receptor interaction. Force measurement using atomic force microscopy can serve to quantitatively analyze the effect of candidate drugs that modulate virus-host receptor affinity.

TI  - Quantitative Label-Free Phosphoproteomics Reveals Differentially Regulated Protein Phosphorylation Involved in West Nile Virus-Induced Host Inflammatory Response.
JF  - Journal of proteome research
VL  - 14 12
SP  - 5157
EP  - 68
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) can cause neuro-invasive and febrile illness that may be fatal to humans. The production of inflammatory cytokines is key to mediating WNV-induced immunopathology in the central nervous system. Elucidating the host factors utilized by WNV for productive infection would provide valuable insights into the evasion strategies used by this virus. Although attempts have been made to determine these host factors, proteomic data depicting WNV-host protein interactions are limited. We applied liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for label-free, quantitative phosphoproteomics to systematically investigate the global phosphorylation events induced by WNV infection. Quantifiable changes to 1,657 phosphoproteins were found; of these, 626 were significantly upregulated and 227 were downregulated at 12 h postinfection. The phosphoproteomic data were subjected to gene ontology enrichment analysis, which returned the inflammation-related spliceosome, ErbB, mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor kappa B, and mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling pathways. We used short interfering RNAs to decrease the levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, bifunctional polynucleotide phosphatase/kinase, and retinoblastoma 1 and found that the activity of nuclear factor kappa B (p65) is significantly decreased in WNV-infected U251 cells, which in turn led to markedly reduced inflammatory cytokine production. Our results provide a better understanding of the host response to WNV infection and highlight multiple targets for the development of antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies.

TI  - RETREG1 (FAM134B): A new player in human diseases: 15 years after the discovery in cancer
JF  - Journal of Cellular Physiology
VL  - 233
SP  - 4479
EP  - 4489
AB  - FAM134B (family with sequence similarity 134, member B)/RETREG1 and its functional roles are relatively new in human diseases. This review aimed to summarize various functions of FAM134B since our first discovery of the gene in 2001. The protein encoded by FAM134B is a reticulophagy receptor that regulates turnover of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by selective phagocytosis. Absence or non‐functional expression of FAM134B protein impairs ER‐turnover and thereby is involved in the pathogenesis of some human diseases. FAM134B inhibition contributes to impair proteostasis in the ER due to the accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins, which in turn leads to compromised neuronal survival and progressive neuronal degenerative diseases. Mutations in FAM134B associated with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IIB (HSAN IIB). Selective cleavage of FAM134B by Dengue, Zika, and West Nile virus encoded protease NS2B3 leads to the increased production of infection units, whereas upregulation of FAM134B inhibits viral replication. In cancer, FAM134B acts as a tumor suppressor and inhibit cancer growth both in‐vitro and in‐vivo. Pharmacological upregulation of FAM134B resulted in reduced cancer cell growth and proliferation. In addition, FAM134B mutations are common in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma, and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. These mutations and expression changes of FAM134B were associated with the biological aggressiveness of these cancers. FAM134B also plays a role in allergic rhinitis, vascular dementia, and identification of stem cells. Taken together, information available in the literature suggests that FAM134B plays critical roles in human diseases, by interacting with different biological and chemical mediators, which are primarily regulated by ER turnover.

TI  - RIG-I-like receptors direct inflammatory macrophage polarization against West Nile virus infection
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 10
AB  - RIG-I-Like Receptors (RLRs) RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2, are vital pathogen recognition receptors in the defense against RNA viruses. West Nile Virus (WNV) infections continue to grow in the US. Here, we use a systems biology approach to define the contributions of each RLR in the innate immune response to WNV. Genome-wide RNAseq and bioinformatics analyses of macrophages from mice lacking either RLR reveal that the RLRs drive distinct immune gene activation and response polarization to mediate an M1/inflammatory signature while suppressing the M2/wound healing phenotype. While LGP2 functions to modulate inflammatory signaling, RIG-I and MDA5 together are essential for M1 macrophage polarization in vivo and the control of WNV infection through potential downstream control of ATF4 and SMAD4 to regulate target gene expression for cell polarization. These analyses reveal the RLR-driven signature of macrophage polarization, innate immune protection, and immune programming against WNV infection. RIG-I- like receptors (RLRs) play an important role in immune defense against West Nile virus (WNV). Here, using a systems biology approach, the authors show that macrophage polarization to a proinflammatory M1 phenotype via RIG-I and MDA5 signaling is critical for innate immune control in WNV-infected mouse tissues.

TI  - RNA Structures Required for Production of Subgenomic Flavivirus RNA
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 11407
EP  - 11417
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses are a group of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses causing ∼100 million infections per year. We have recently shown that flaviviruses produce a unique, small, noncoding RNA (∼0.5 kb) derived from the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the genomic RNA (gRNA), which is required for flavivirus-induced cytopathicity and pathogenicity (G. P. Pijlman et al., Cell Host Microbe, 4: 579-591, 2008). This RNA (subgenomic flavivirus RNA [sfRNA]) is a product of incomplete degradation of gRNA presumably by the cellular 5′-3′ exoribonuclease XRN1, which stalls on the rigid secondary structure stem-loop II (SL-II) located at the beginning of the 3′ UTR. Mutations or deletions of various secondary structures in the 3′ UTR resulted in the loss of full-length sfRNA (sfRNA1) and production of smaller and less abundant sfRNAs (sfRNA2 and sfRNA3). Here, we investigated in detail the importance of West Nile virus Kunjin (WNVKUN) 3′ UTR secondary structures as well as tertiary interactions for sfRNA formation. We show that secondary structures SL-IV and dumbbell 1 (DB1) downstream of SL-II are able to prevent further degradation of gRNA when the SL-II structure is deleted, leading to production of sfRNA2 and sfRNA3, respectively. We also show that a number of pseudoknot (PK) interactions, in particular PK1 stabilizing SL-II and PK3 stabilizing DB1, are required for protection of gRNA from nuclease degradation and production of sfRNA. Our results show that PK interactions play a vital role in the production of nuclease-resistant sfRNA, which is essential for viral cytopathicity in cells and pathogenicity in mice.

JF  - Archives of Virology
VL  - 141
SP  - 685
EP  - 699
AB  - SummaryKunjin virus (KUN) C is a typical flavivirus core protein which is truncated in vivo to a mature form of 105 residues enriched in lysine and arginine. In order to study the possible association of KUN C with RNA in vitro, we prepared several recombinant C proteins with specific deletions, each fused at the amino-terminus to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and expressed inE. coli. They were reacted with KUN RNA probes transcribed in vitro from cDNA representing the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR, 93 of 96 nucleotides), the 3′ UTR (624 nucleotides), and the 5′ UTR plus most of the C coding region (t′ core, 440 nucleotides). Fusion protein C107 (incorporating mature C) bound strongly to all KUN RNA probes with apparent specificity, being completely resistant to inhibition by 800 mM NaCl, and to competition by a large excess of tRNA. In reactions with labelled KUN RNA probes putative binding sites were identified in the isolated amino-terminal (32 residues) and carboxyterminal (26 residues) basic amino acid domains; this binding was strongly competed by unlabelled KUN UTR probes but weakly or not at all by tRNA. These small domains probably acted co-operatively in binding of mature C to KUN RNA probes. The KUN RNA-core protein binding reactions are similar to those reported with other viral coat or capsid proteins and viral RNAs.

TI  - RNA chaperoning and intrinsic disorder in the core proteins of Flaviviridae
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 36
SP  - 712
EP  - 725
AB  - RNA chaperone proteins are essential partners of RNA in living organisms and viruses. They are thought to assist in the correct folding and structural rearrangements of RNA molecules by resolving misfolded RNA species in an ATP-independent manner. RNA chaperoning is probably an entropy-driven process, mediated by the coupled binding and folding of intrinsically disordered protein regions and the kinetically trapped RNA. Previously, we have shown that the core protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a potent RNA chaperone that can drive profound structural modifications of HCV RNA in vitro. We now examined the RNA chaperone activity and the disordered nature of core proteins from different Flaviviridae genera, namely that of HCV, GBV-B (GB virus B), WNV (West Nile virus) and BVDV (bovine viral diarrhoea virus). Despite low-sequence similarities, all four proteins demonstrated general nucleic acid annealing and RNA chaperone activities. Furthermore, heat resistance of core proteins, as well as far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy suggested that a well-defined 3D protein structure is not necessary for core-induced RNA structural rearrangements. These data provide evidence that RNA chaperoning—possibly mediated by intrinsically disordered protein segments—is conserved in Flaviviridae core proteins. Thus, besides nucleocapsid formation, core proteins may function in RNA structural rearrangements taking place during virus replication.

TI  - RNA elements required for the high efficiency of West Nile Virus-induced ribosomal frameshifting
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - West Nile Virus (WNV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, requires programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) for translation of the viral genome. The efficiency of WNV frameshifting is among the highest observed to date. Despite structural similarities to frameshifting sites in other viruses, it remains unclear why WNV exhibits such a high frameshifting efficiency. Here we employed dual-luciferase reporter assays in multiple human cell lines to probe the RNA requirements for highly efficient frameshifting by the WNV genome. We find that both the sequence and structure of a predicted RNA pseudoknot downstream of the slippery sequence–the codons in the genome on which frameshifting occurs–are required for efficient frameshifting. We also show that multiple proposed RNA secondary structures downstream of the slippery sequence are inconsistent with efficient frameshifting. We mapped the most favorable distance between the slippery site and the pseudoknot essential for optimal frameshifting, and found the base of the pseudoknot structure likely is unfolded prior to frameshifting. Finally, we find that many mutations in the WNV slippery sequence allow efficient frameshifting, but often result in aberrant shifting into other reading frames. Mutations in the slippery sequence also support a model in which frameshifting occurs concurrent with or after translocation of the mRNA and tRNA on the ribosome. These results provide a comprehensive analysis of the molecular determinants of WNV-programmed ribosomal frameshifting and provide a foundation for the development of new antiviral strategies targeting viral gene expression.

TI  - RNA elements required for the high efficiency of West Nile virus-induced ribosomal frameshifting
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 53
AB  - Abstract West Nile virus (WNV) requires programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting for translation of the viral genome. The efficiency of WNV frameshifting is among the highest known. However, it remains unclear why WNV exhibits such a high frameshifting efficiency. Here, we employed dual-luciferase reporter assays in multiple human cell lines to probe the RNA requirements for highly efficient frameshifting by the WNV genome. We find that both the sequence and structure of a predicted RNA pseudoknot downstream of the slippery sequence—the codons in the genome on which frameshifting occurs—are required for efficient frameshifting. We also show that multiple proposed RNA secondary structures downstream of the slippery sequence are inconsistent with efficient frameshifting. We also find that the base of the pseudoknot structure likely is unfolded prior to frameshifting. Finally, we show that many mutations in the WNV slippery sequence allow efficient frameshifting, but often result in aberrant shifting into other reading frames. Mutations in the slippery sequence also support a model in which frameshifting occurs concurrent with or after ribosome translocation. These results provide a comprehensive analysis of the molecular determinants of WNV-programmed ribosomal frameshifting and provide a foundation for the development of new antiviral strategies targeting viral gene expression.

TI  - RNA elements within the 5' untranslated region of the West Nile virus genome are critical for RNA synthesis and virus replication.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 91 Pt 5
SP  - 1218
EP  - 23
AB  - RNA elements within the flavivirus genome may play essential regulatory roles during virus replication. Here, recombinant West Nile virus (WNV) NS5 protein was used in combination with WNV subgenomic RNA templates to establish in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA-binding assays. These assays identified mutations in the stem-loop A (SLA) region of the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) altering NS5 RNA synthesis and RNA-binding capability. These mutations were then introduced into the full-length WNV genome by reverse genetics. Further analysis of the mutant viruses showed that deletion of nt 46-60, which disrupted the stem and side loop of SLA, greatly compromised virus replication, whereas mutations that destroyed the top loop of SLA required for RNA synthesis in vitro did not significantly alter virus replication. These results suggest that SLA present in the 5'UTR of WNV is essential for RNA synthesis in vitro and for virus replication.

TI  - RNASEK is required for internalization of diverse acid-dependent viruses
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 112
SP  - 7797
EP  - 7802
AB  - Significance Many viruses, including those of global concern, are dependent on internalization for their entry. We found that ribonuclease kappa (RNASEK) is required for infection of every virus we tested that enters cells through an acid-dependent pathway, including dengue, West Nile, Sindbis, Rift Valley Fever, and influenza viruses. Mechanistically, we found that RNASEK has no effect on virus binding to cells but, rather, is required for their uptake. RNASEK was required for diverse viruses that are dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis for entry, but we found that RNASEK was dispensable for general endocytic uptake. Therefore, RNASEK appears to play a unique role in viral uptake and may be a therapeutically viable target to inhibit major human viral pathogens. Viruses must gain entry into cells to establish infection. In general, viruses enter either at the plasma membrane or from intracellular endosomal compartments. Viruses that use endosomal pathways are dependent on the cellular factors that control this process; however, these genes have proven to be essential for endogenous cargo uptake, and thus are of limited value for therapeutic intervention. The identification of genes that are selectively required for viral uptake would make appealing drug targets, as their inhibition would block an early step in the life cycle of diverse viruses. At this time, we lack pan-antiviral therapeutics, in part because of our lack of knowledge of such cellular factors. RNAi screening has begun to reveal previously unknown genes that play roles in viral infection. We identified dRNASEK in two genome-wide RNAi screens performed in Drosophila cells against West Nile and Rift Valley Fever viruses. Here we found that ribonuclease kappa (RNASEK) is essential for the infection of human cells by divergent and unrelated positive- and negative-strand-enveloped viruses from the Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Orthomyxoviridae families that all enter cells from endosomal compartments. In contrast, RNASEK was dispensable for viruses, including parainfluenza virus 5 and Coxsackie B virus, that enter at the plasma membrane. RNASEK is dispensable for attachment but is required for uptake of these acid-dependent viruses. Furthermore, this requirement appears specific, as general endocytic uptake of transferrin is unaffected in RNASEK-depleted cells. Therefore, RNASEK is a potential host cell Achilles’ heel for viral infection.

TI  - RNAi Targeting of West Nile Virus in Mosquito Midguts Promotes Virus Diversification
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 5
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) exists in nature as a genetically diverse population of competing genomes. This high genetic diversity and concomitant adaptive plasticity has facilitated the rapid adaptation of WNV to North American transmission cycles and contributed to its explosive spread throughout the New World. WNV is maintained in nature in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes and birds, with intrahost genetic diversity highest in mosquitoes. The mechanistic basis for this increase in genetic diversity in mosquitoes is poorly understood. To determine whether the high mutational diversity of WNV in mosquitoes is driven by RNA interference (RNAi), we characterized the RNAi response to WNV in the midguts of orally exposed Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus using high-throughput, massively parallel sequencing and estimated viral genetic diversity. Our data demonstrate that WNV infection in orally exposed vector mosquitoes induces the RNAi pathway and that regions of the WNV genome that are more intensely targeted by RNAi are more likely to contain point mutations compared to weakly targeted regions. These results suggest that, under natural conditions, positive selection of WNV within mosquitoes is stronger in regions highly targeted by the host RNAi response. Further, they provide a mechanistic basis for the relative importance of mosquitoes in driving WNV diversification.

TI  - RNase L Plays a Role in the Antiviral Response to West Nile Virus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80

EP  - 2999
AB  - ABSTRACT Alleles at the Flv locus determine disease outcome after a flavivirus infection in mice. Although comparable numbers of congenic resistant and susceptible mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) are infected by the flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV), resistant MEFs produce ∼100- to 150-fold lower titers than susceptible ones and flavivirus titers in the brains of resistant and susceptible animals can differ by >10,000-fold. The Flv locus was previously identified as the 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetase 1b (Oas1b) gene. Oas gene expression is up-regulated by interferon (IFN), and after activation by double-stranded RNA, some mouse synthetases produce 2-5A, which activates latent RNase L to degrade viral and cellular RNAs. To determine whether the lower levels of intracellular flavivirus genomic RNA from resistant mice detected in cells at all times after infection were mediated by RNase L, RNase L activity levels in congenic resistant and susceptible cells were compared. Similar moderate levels of RNase L activation by transfected 2-5A were observed in both types of uninfected cells. After WNV infection, the mRNAs of IFN-β and three Oas genes were up-regulated to similar levels in both types of cells. However, significant levels of RNase L activity were not detected until 72 h after WNV infection and the patterns of viral RNA cleavage products generated were similar in both types of cells. When RNase L activity was down-regulated in resistant cells via stable expression of a dominant negative RNase L mutant, ∼5- to 10-times-higher yields of WNV were produced. Similarly, about ∼5- to 10-times-higher virus yields were produced by susceptible C57BL/6 RNase L−/− cells compared to RNase L+/+ cells that were either left untreated or pretreated with IFN and/or poly(I) · poly(C). The data indicate that WNV genomic RNA is susceptible to RNase L cleavage and that RNase L plays a role in the cellular antiviral response to flaviviruses. The results suggest that RNase L activation is not a major component of the Oas1b-mediated flavivirus resistance phenotype.

TI  - RNase L-induced bodies sequester subgenomic flavivirus RNAs and re-establish host RNA decay
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) are structured RNA elements encoded in the 3’-UTR of flaviviruses that promote viral infection by inhibiting cellular RNA decay machinery. Herein, we analyze the production of sfRNAs using single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA-FISH) and super-resolution microscopy during West Nile virus, Zika virus, or Dengue virus serotype 2 infection. We show that sfRNAs are initially localized diffusely in the cytosol or in processing bodies (P-bodies). However, upon activation of the host antiviral endoribonuclease, Ribonuclease L (RNase L), nearly all sfRNAs re-localize to antiviral biological condensates known as RNase L-induced bodies (RLBs). RLB-mediated sequestration of sfRNAs reduces sfRNA association with RNA decay machinery in P-bodies, which coincides with increased viral RNA decay. These findings establish a role of RLBs in promoting viral RNA decay, demonstrating the complex host-pathogen interactions at the level of RNA decay and biological condensation. Highlights Single-molecule imaging of sfRNA production and localization sfRNAs localize to RNase L-induced bodies RNase L-induced bodies sequester sfRNAs away from P-bodies Sequestration of sfRNAs by RNase L-induced bodies enhances decay of viral genomes

TI  - Rab 5 Is Required for the Cellular Entry of Dengue and West Nile Viruses
JF  - Journal of Virology

EP  - 4885
AB  - ABSTRACT The mechanisms of cellular entry of dengue and West Nile viruses are not well characterized. We show that both these viruses enter HeLa cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis and require vacuolar acidic pH. Inhibition of the GTPase Rab 5 or 7, which regulates transport to early or late endosomes, respectively, demonstrated that Rab 5 was essential for survival of both dengue and West Nile virus. These data broaden our understanding of the pathways required for productive dengue and West Nile virus infection and may facilitate new strategies for combating disease.

TI  - Rab8b Regulates Transport of West Nile Virus Particles from Recycling Endosomes*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 291
SP  - 6559
EP  - 6568
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) particles assemble at and bud into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are secreted from infected cells through the secretory pathway. However, the host factor related to these steps is not fully understood. Rab proteins, belonging to the Ras superfamily, play essential roles in regulating many aspects of vesicular trafficking. In this study, we sought to determine which Rab proteins are involved in intracellular trafficking of nascent WNV particles. RNAi analysis revealed that Rab8b plays a role in WNV particle release. We found that Rab8 and WNV antigen were colocalized in WNV-infected human neuroblastoma cells, and that WNV infection enhanced Rab8 expression in the cells. In addition, the amount of WNV particles in the supernatant of Rab8b-deficient cells was significantly decreased compared with that of wild-type cells. We also demonstrated that WNV particles accumulated in the recycling endosomes in WNV-infected cells. In summary, these results suggest that Rab8b is involved in trafficking of WNV particles from recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has been a significant public health concern in the United States for nearly two decades. The virus has been linked to acute viral encephalitis, neurological sequelae, and chronic kidney diseases. Neither antiviral drugs nor vaccines are currently available for humans. In vitro cell culture and experimental animal models have been used to study WNV infection in humans. In this review, we will focus on recent findings and provide new insights into WNV host immunity and viral pathogenesis.

JF  - Autophagy
VL  - 11
SP  - 861
EP  - 864
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for recurrent outbreaks of meningitis and encephalitis. Several studies analyzing the interactions of this pathogen with the autophagic pathway have reported opposite results with evidence for and against the upregulation of autophagy in infected cells. In this regard, we have recently reported that minimal genetic changes (single amino acid substitutions) in nonstructural proteins of WNV can modify the ability of the virus to induce autophagic features such as LC3 modification and aggregation in infected cells. We think that these results could help explain some of the previously reported discrepancies. These findings could also aid in deciphering the interactions of this pathogen with the autophagic pathway at the molecular level aimed to develop feasible antiviral strategies to combat this pathogen, and other related flaviviruses.

TI  - Refolding of a fully functional flavivirus methyltransferase revealed that S‐adenosyl methionine but not S‐adenosyl homocysteine is copurified with flavivirus methyltransferase
JF  - Protein Science
VL  - 24
AB  - Methylation of flavivirus RNA is vital for its stability and translation in the infected host cell. This methylation is mediated by the flavivirus methyltransferase (MTase), which methylates the N7 and 2′‐O positions of the viral RNA cap by using S‐adenosyl‐l‐methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor. In this report, we demonstrate that SAM, in contrast to the reaction by‐product S‐adenosyl‐l‐homocysteine, which was assumed previously, is copurified with the Dengue (DNV) and West Nile virus MTases produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli). This endogenous SAM can be removed by denaturation and refolding of the MTase protein. The refolded MTase of DNV serotype 3 (DNV3) displays methylation activity comparable to native enzyme, and its crystal structure at 2.1 Å is almost identical to that of native MTase. We characterized the binding of Sinefungin (SIN), a previously described SAM‐analog inhibitor of MTase function, to the native and refolded DNV3 MTase by isothermal titration calorimetry, and found that SIN binds to refolded MTase with more than 16 times the affinity of SIN binding to the MTase purified natively. Moreover, we show that SAM is also copurified with other flavivirus MTases, indicating that purification by refolding may be a generally applicable tool for studying flavivirus MTase inhibition.

JF  - Journal of Clinical Investigation
VL  - 127
SP  - 843–856
EP  - 
AB  - Type I IFNs promote cellular responses to viruses, and IFN receptor (IFNAR) signaling regulates the responses of endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) during neurotropic viral infection. However, the role of astrocytes in innate immune responses of the BBB during viral infection of the CNS remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we have demonstrated that type I IFNAR signaling in astrocytes regulates BBB permeability and protects the cerebellum from infection and immunopathology. Mice with astrocyte-specific loss of IFNAR signaling showed decreased survival after West Nile virus infection. Accelerated mortality was not due to expanded viral tropism or increased replication. Rather, viral entry increased specifically in the hindbrain of IFNAR-deficient mice, suggesting that IFNAR signaling critically regulates BBB permeability in this brain region. Pattern recognition receptors and IFN-stimulated genes had higher basal and IFN-induced expression in human and mouse cerebellar astrocytes than did cerebral cortical astrocytes, suggesting that IFNAR signaling has brain region–specific roles in CNS immune responses. Taken together, our data identify cerebellar astrocytes as key responders to viral infection and highlight the existence of distinct innate immune programs in astrocytes from evolutionarily disparate regions of the CNS.

TI  - Regulated Cleavages at the West Nile Virus NS4A-2K-NS4B Junctions Play a Major Role in Rearranging Cytoplasmic Membranes and Golgi Trafficking of the NS4A Protein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 4623
EP  - 4632
AB  - ABSTRACT A common feature associated with the replication of most RNA viruses is the formation of a unique membrane environment encapsulating the viral replication complex. For their part, flaviviruses are no exception, whereupon infection causes a dramatic rearrangement and induction of unique membrane structures within the cytoplasm of infected cells. These virus-induced membranes, termed paracrystalline arrays, convoluted membranes, and vesicle packets, all appear to have specific functions during replication and are derived from different organelles within the host cell. The aim of this study was to identify which protein(s) specified by the Australian strain of West Nile virus, Kunjin virus (KUNV), are responsible for the dramatic membrane alterations observed during infection. Thus, we have shown using immunolabeling of ultrathin cryosections of transfected cells that expression of the KUNV polyprotein intermediates NS4A-4B and NS2B-3-4A, as well as that of individual NS4A proteins with and without the C-terminal transmembrane domain 2K, resulted in different degrees of rearrangement of cytoplasmic membranes. The formation of the membrane structures characteristic for virus infection required coexpression of an NS4A-NS4B cassette with the viral protease NS2B-3pro which was shown to be essential for the release of the individual NS4A and NS4B proteins. Individual expression of NS4A protein retaining the C-terminal transmembrane domain 2K resulted in the induction of membrane rearrangements most resembling virus-induced structures, while removal of the 2K domain led to a less profound membrane rearrangement but resulted in the redistribution of the NS4A protein to the Golgi apparatus. The results show that cleavage of the KUNV polyprotein NS4A-4B by the viral protease is the key initiation event in the induction of membrane rearrangement and that the NS4A protein intermediate containing the uncleaved C-terminal transmembrane domain plays an essential role in these membrane rearrangements.

TI  - Regulation of Apoptosis during Flavivirus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 9
AB  - Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death that regulates cellular homeostasis by removing damaged or unnecessary cells. Its importance in host defenses is highlighted by the observation that many viruses evade, obstruct, or subvert apoptosis, thereby blunting the host immune response. Infection with Flaviviruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV) has been shown to activate several signaling pathways such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress and AKT/PI3K pathway, resulting in activation or suppression of apoptosis in virus-infected cells. On the other hands, expression of some viral proteins induces or protects apoptosis. There is a discrepancy between induction and suppression of apoptosis during flavivirus infection because the experimental situation may be different, and strong links between apoptosis and other types of cell death such as necrosis may make it more difficult. In this paper, we review the effects of apoptosis on viral propagation and pathogenesis during infection with flaviviruses.

JF  - 
VL  - 
SP  - 317
EP  - 333
AB  - This chapter provides an overview of Flaviviridae and their regulation of host-cell innate immune defenses. The viruses that comprise the Flaviviridae family are small enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. The Flaviviridae are divided into three genera of more closely related viruses: Flavivirus, Pestivirus, and Hepacivirus. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is now the most common cause of liver failure and liver transplantation in the United States and Europe. The ability to sense an invading pathogen is critical to the cell’s ability to respond in an appropriate manner to clear the infection. The cell utilizes a group of proteins known as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect the presence of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) within products of viral replication. It is likely that RIG-I primarily detects motifs within the genomes of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DV), and West Nile virus (WNV), as it does with HCV, since Flavivirus genomes are capped and therefore do not present naked 5' ppp motifs as PAMPs. Examination of interferon (IFN) signaling in infected cells has revealed strategies by which Flaviviridae members attenuate IFN-a/β receptor signaling actions, thus limiting the downstream expression of ISGs that otherwise control virus replication and spread. The Flaviviridae represent major pathogens of public health, agriculture, and environmental importance. Molecular studies have revealed common and unique mechanisms by which members of the different Flaviviridae genera evade host innate immunity and IFN actions that would otherwise limit infection.

JF  - Viral immunology
VL  - 15 2

EP  - 83
AB  - We have shown the flaviviruses can up-regulate the cell surface expression of the immune recognition molecules, major histocompatability complex class-I and class-II (MHC-I, MHC-II), ICAM-1, VCAM, and E-selectin, in an interferon-independent and tumor necrosis factor-independent manner. This up-regulation is associated with an increased transcription of the relevant genes and is due to activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa B. The level of up-regulation is determined in part by the cell cycle position of the cell when infected with the flavivirus, as quiescent cells show a greater increase in the level of expression of the immune recognition molecules, MHC-I and ICAM-1, than cells in other phases of the cell cycle. The resultant increased cell surface expression is functional with the increased expression resulting in increased recognition by flavivirus-specific and allo-specific cytotoxic T cells.

AB  - In order to determine the requirements for secretion of flavivirus structural proteins, we analyzed the expression of several West Nile flavivirus gene cassettes of different lengths in vaccinia virus expression systems. Expression of the longest cassette coding for the 5'-nontranslated region, proteins C through NS2B, and the protease domain of NS3, resulted in secretion of prM-E complexes and cleavage of prM. The presence and proper processing of the NS2A-NS2B-NS3 region appeared to be necessary for prM-E secretion. These proteins were released from cells mostly as membranous complexes which may represent empty viral envelopes. Cleavage of the membrane-associated intracellular form of protein C (C(i)) to produce the virion form (Ce) appeared to be critical for release of viral proteins. The presence and proper cleavage of the NS2A-NS2B-NS3 region were also found to be necessary for efficient C-prM cleavage by signalases. The NS2B-NS3 complex was implicated in cleavage of the intracellular form of protein C. Formation of a low level of virus-like particles was detected by electron microscopy. A model for virion formation, suggesting a critical role of the NS2B and NS3 proteins, is discussed.

TI  - Regulatory Role of Host MicroRNAs in Flaviviruses Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA that affect mRNA abundance or translation efficiency by binding to the 3′UTR of the mRNA of the target gene, thereby participating in multiple biological processes, including viral infection. Flavivirus genus consists of small, positive-stranded, single-stranded RNA viruses transmitted by arthropods, especially mosquitoes and ticks. The genus contains several globally significant human/animal pathogens, such as Dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Yellow fever virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Tembusu virus. After flavivirus invades, the expression of host miRNA changes, exerting the immune escape mechanism to create an environment conducive to its survival, and the altered miRNA in turn affects the life cycle of the virus. Accumulated evidence suggests that host miRNAs influence flavivirus replication and host–virus interactions through direct binding of viral genomes or through virus-mediated host transcriptome changes. Furthermore, miRNA can also interweave with other non-coding RNAs, such as long non-coding RNA and circular RNA, to form an interaction network to regulate viral replication. A variety of non-coding RNAs produced by the virus itself exert similar function by interacting with cellular RNA and viral RNA. Understanding the interaction sites between non-coding RNA, especially miRNA, and virus/host genes will help us to find targets for antiviral drugs and viral therapy.

TI  - Relationships between Infection, Dissemination, and Transmission of West Nile Virus RNA in Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae)
VL  - 49
SP  - 132
EP  - 142
AB  - ABSTRACT 
 Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say fed blood containing 6.8 ± 0.3 logs (mean ± SE) plaque-forming units of West Nile virus (WNV)/ml were maintained at 28°C for incubation periods (IP) of 7, 14, or 21 d. Several attributes of vector competence were determined at each IP using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to estimate plaque forming unit equivalents including: infection rate (WNV-positive abdomens), dissemination rate (WNV-positive legs or thoraces), combined dissemination rate (WNV-positive legs and thoraces), transmission rate (WNV-positive saliva), and WNV titers in abdomens, legs, thoraces, and saliva. Each rate increased or was equivalent with increasing IP. Mosquitoes transmitting WNV in saliva also had significantly higher IP-dependent WNV titers in abdomens, legs, and thoraces. Titers of WNV in abdomens were significantly correlated with titers in legs and thoraces, but the degree of association changed with IP. However, titers of abdomens, legs, and thoraces were not correlated with WNV presence or titer in the saliva. The results show that WNV presence or titer in the saliva of infected Cx. p. quinquefasciatus was not directly influenced by processes involved in WNV replication in other tissues. The processes controlling midgut infection and escape are, in part, independent from the infection processes in other tissues. The relationship between infection, dissemination, and transmission varied over time. The infection and replication of WNV in different tissues is likely influenced by different barriers encountered during the extrinsic incubation period. The significance of these observations for understanding vector competence is discussed.

TI  - Remodeling of the Actin Network Associated with the Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1) of West Nile Virus and Formation of NS1-Containing Tunneling Nanotubes
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - The cellular response to the recombinant NS1 protein of West Nile virus (NS1WNV) was studied using three different cell types: Vero E6 simian epithelial cells, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, and U-87MG human astrocytoma cells. Cells were exposed to two different forms of NS1WNV: (i) the exogenous secreted form, sNS1WNV, added to the extracellular milieu; and (ii) the endogenous NS1WNV, the intracellular form expressed in plasmid-transfected cells. The cell attachment and uptake of sNS1WNV varied with the cell type and were only detectable in Vero E6 and SH-SY5Y cells. Addition of sNS1WNV to the cell culture medium resulted in significant remodeling of the actin filament network in Vero E6 cells. This effect was not observed in SH-SY5Y and U-87MG cells, implying that the cellular uptake of sNS1WNV and actin network remodeling were dependent on cell type. In the three cell types, NS1WNV-expressing cells formed filamentous projections reminiscent of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). These TNT-like projections were found to contain actin and NS1WNV proteins. Interestingly, similar actin-rich, TNT-like filaments containing NS1WNV and the viral envelope glycoprotein EWNV were also observed in WNV-infected Vero E6 cells.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. Flaviviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells and modify the host cell environment. Although much has been learned about virion structure and virion-endosomal membrane fusion, the cell receptor(s) used have not been definitively identified and little is known about the early stages of the virus replication cycle. Members of the genus Flavivirus differ from members of the two other genera of the family by the lack of a genomic internal ribosomal entry sequence and the creation of invaginations in the ER membrane rather than double-membrane vesicles that are used as the sites of exponential genome synthesis. The WNV genome 3' and 5' sequences that form the long distance RNA-RNA interaction required for minus strand initiation have been identified and contact sites on the 5' RNA stem loop for NS5 have been mapped. Structures obtained for many of the viral proteins have provided information relevant to their functions. Viral nonstructural protein interactions are complex and some may occur only in infected cells. Although interactions between many cellular proteins and virus components have been identified, the functions of most of these interactions have not been delineated.

JF  - The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene
VL  - 85 2
SP  - 374
EP  - 8
AB  - Most of sequenced West Nile virus (WNV) genomes encode a single N-linked glycosylation site on their envelope (E) proteins. We previously found that WNV lacking the E protein glycan was severely inhibited in its ability to replicate and spread within two important mosquito vector species, Culex pipiens and Cx. tarsalis. However, recent work with a closely related species, Cx. pipiens pallens, found no association between E protein glycosylation and either replication or dissemination. To examine this finding further, we expanded upon our previous studies to include an additional Culex species, Cx. quinquefasciatus. The non-glycosylated WNV-N154I virus replicated less efficiently in mosquito tissues after intrathoracic inoculation, but there was little difference in replication efficiency in the midgut after peroral infection. Interestingly, although infectivity was inhibited when WNV lacked the E protein glycan, there was little difference in viral spread throughout the mosquito. These data indicate that E protein glycosylation affects WNV-vector interactions in a species-specific manner.

TI  - Requirements for West Nile Virus (–)- and (+)-Strand Subgenomic RNA Synthesis in Vitro by the Viral RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase Expressed in Escherichia coli*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 279
SP  - 12141
EP  - 12151
AB  - RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) of the Flaviviridae family catalyze replication of positive (+)- strand viral RNA through synthesis of minus (–)-and progeny (+)-strand RNAs. West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne member, is a rapidly re-emerging human pathogen in the United States since its first outbreak in 1999. To study the replication of the WNV RNA in vitro, an assay is described here that utilizes the WNV RdRP and subgenomic (–)- and (+)-strand template RNAs containing 5′- and 3′-terminal regions (TR) with the conserved sequence elements. Our results show that both 5′- and 3′-TRs of the (+)-strand RNA template including the wild type cyclization (CYC) motifs are important for RNA synthesis. However, the 3′-TR of the (–)-strand RNA template alone is sufficient for RNA synthesis. Mutational analysis of the CYC motifs revealed that the (+)-strand 5′-CYC motif is critical for (–)-strand RNA synthesis but neither the (–)-strand 5′- nor 3′-CYC motif is important for the (+)-strand RNA synthesis. Moreover, the 5′-cap inhibits the (–)-strand RNA synthesis from the 3′ fold-back structure of (+)-strand RNA template without affecting the de novo synthesis of RNA. These results support a model that “cyclization” of the viral RNA play a role for (–)-strand RNA synthesis but not for (+)-strand RNA synthesis.

JF  - Insect Science
VL  - 31
AB  - Mosquito‐borne viruses (MBVs) are a large class of viruses transmitted mainly through mosquito bites, including dengue virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and chikungunya virus, which pose a major threat to the health of people around the world. With global warming and extended human activities, the incidence of many MBVs has increased significantly. Mosquito saliva contains a variety of bioactive protein components. These not only enable blood feeding but also play a crucial role in regulating local infection at the bite site and the remote dissemination of MBVs as well as in remodeling the innate and adaptive immune responses of host vertebrates. Here, we review the physiological functions of mosquito salivary proteins (MSPs) in detail, the influence and the underlying mechanism of MSPs on the transmission of MBVs, and the current progress and issues that urgently need to be addressed in the research and development of MSP‐based MBV transmission blocking vaccines.

TI  - Resistance to Alpha/Beta Interferon Is a Determinant of West Nile Virus Replication Fitness and Virulence
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 9424
EP  - 9434
AB  - ABSTRACT The emergence of West Nile virus (WNV) in the Western Hemisphere is marked by the spread of pathogenic lineage I strains, which differ from typically avirulent lineage II strains. To begin to understand the virus-host interactions that may influence the phenotypic properties of divergent lineage I and II viruses, we compared the genetic, pathogenic, and alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β)-regulatory properties of a lineage II isolate from Madagascar (MAD78) with those of a new lineage I isolate from Texas (TX02). Full genome sequence analysis revealed that MAD78 clustered, albeit distantly, with other lineage II strains, while TX02 clustered with emergent North American isolates, more specifically with other Texas strains. Compared to TX02, MAD78 replicated at low levels in cultured human cells, was highly sensitive to the antiviral actions of IFN in vitro, and demonstrated a completely avirulent phenotype in wild-type mice. In contrast to TX02 and other pathogenic forms of WNV, MAD78 was defective in its ability to disrupt IFN-induced JAK-STAT signaling, including the activation of Tyk2 and downstream phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2. However, replication of MAD78 was rescued in cells with a nonfunctional IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR). Consistent with this finding, the virulence of MAD78 was unmasked upon infection of mice lacking IFNAR. Thus, control of the innate host response and IFN actions is a key feature of WNV pathogenesis and replication fitness.

TI  - Restriction of Flaviviruses by an Interferon-Stimulated Gene SHFL/C19orf66
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 23
AB  - Flaviviruses (the genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family) include many arthropod-borne viruses, often causing life-threatening diseases in humans, such as hemorrhaging and encephalitis. Although the flaviviruses have a significant clinical impact, it has become apparent that flavivirus replication is restricted by cellular factors induced by the interferon (IFN) response, which are called IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). SHFL (shiftless antiviral inhibitor of ribosomal frameshifting) is a novel ISG that inhibits dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections. Interestingly, SHFL functions as a broad-spectrum antiviral factor exhibiting suppressive activity against various types of RNA and DNA viruses. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which SHFL inhibits flavivirus infection and discuss the molecular basis of the inhibitory mechanism using a predicted tertiary structure of SHFL generated by the program AlphaFold2.

TI  - Reviewing the Potential Links between Viral Infections and TDP-43 Proteinopathies
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 24
AB  - Transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) was discovered in 2001 as a cellular factor capable to inhibit HIV-1 gene expression. Successively, it was brought to new life as the most prevalent RNA-binding protein involved in several neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Despite the fact that these two research areas could be considered very distant from each other, in recent years an increasing number of publications pointed out the existence of a potentially important connection. Indeed, the ability of TDP-43 to act as an important regulator of all aspects of RNA metabolism makes this protein also a critical factor during expression of viral RNAs. Here, we summarize all recent observations regarding the involvement of TDP-43 in viral entry, replication and latency in several viruses that include enteroviruses (EVs), Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), hepatitis B virus (HBV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), West Nile virus (WNV), and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV). In particular, in this work, we aimed to highlight the presence of similarities with the most commonly studied TDP-43 related neuronal dysfunctions.

TI  - Role of CD8+ T Cells in Control of West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 8312
EP  - 8321
AB  - ABSTRACT Infection with West Nile virus (WNV) causes fatal encephalitis more frequently in immunocompromised humans than in those with a healthy immune system. Although a complete understanding of this increased risk remains unclear, experiments with mice have begun to define how different components of the adaptive and innate immune response function to limit infection. Previously, we demonstrated that components of humoral immunity, particularly immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG, have critical roles in preventing dissemination of WNV infection to the central nervous system. In this study, we addressed the function of CD8+ T cells in controlling WNV infection. Mice that lacked CD8+ T cells or classical class Ia major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens had higher central nervous system viral burdens and increased mortality rates after infection with a low-passage-number WNV isolate. In contrast, an absence of CD8+ T cells had no effect on the qualitative or quantitative antibody response and did not alter the kinetics or magnitude of viremia. In the subset of CD8+-T-cell-deficient mice that survived initial WNV challenge, infectious virus was recovered from central nervous system compartments for several weeks. Primary or memory CD8+ T cells that were generated in vivo efficiently killed target cells that displayed WNV antigens in a class I MHC-restricted manner. Collectively, our experiments suggest that, while specific antibody is responsible for terminating viremia, CD8+ T cells have an important function in clearing infection from tissues and preventing viral persistence.

TI  - Role of IFN‐γ in an experimental murine model of West Nile virus‐induced seizures
JF  - Journal of Neurochemistry
VL  - 103
AB  - Seizures are a major complication of viral encephalitis. However, the mechanisms of seizure‐associated neuronal dysfunction remain poorly understood. We report that intranasal inoculation with West Nile virus (WNV) (Sarafend) causes limbic seizures in C57BL/6 mice, but not in interferon (IFN)‐γ‐deficient (IFN‐γ−/−) mice. Both strains showed similar levels of virus in the brain, as well as similar concentrations of the cytokines, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin‐6, both of which can alter neuronal excitability. Experiments in chimeric IFN‐γ−/− mice reconstituted with IFN‐γ‐producing leukocytes showed that IFN‐γ is not required during central nervous system infection for limbic seizure development, suggesting a role for IFN‐γ in the developing brain. This was supported responses to pentylenetetrazole, kainic acid (KA), and N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA). Both strains of mice exhibited similar behavior after pentylenetetrazole challenge. However, while NMDA and KA treatment resulted in characteristic seizures in C57BL/6 mice, these responses were diminished (NMDA treatment) or absent (KA treatment) in IFN‐γ−/− mice. Furthermore, NMDA‐receptor blockade with MK‐801 in WNV‐infected C57BL/6 mice abrogated seizures and prolonged survival. Our data show that IFN‐γ plays an important role in the development of the excitatory seizure pathways in the brain and that these cascades become pathogenic in encephalitic WNV infection.

TI  - Role of NS1 and TLR3 in Pathogenesis and Immunity of WNV
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus which causes encephalitis especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Previous studies have suggested the protective role of the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) pathway against WNV entry into the brain, while the WNV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) interferes with the TLR3 signaling pathway, besides being a component of viral genome replication machinery. In this study, we investigated whether immunization with NS1 could protect against WNV neuroinvasion in the context of TLR3 deficiency. We immunized mice with either an intact or deleted TLR3 system (TLR3KO) with WNV envelope glycoprotein (gE) protein, NS1, or a combination of gE and NS1. Immunization with gE or gE/NS1, but not with NS1 alone, induced WNV neutralizing antibodies and protected against WNV brain invasion and inflammation. The presence of intact TLR3 signaling had no apparent effect on WNV brain invasion. However, mock-immunized TLR3KO mice had higher inflammatory cell invasion upon WNV brain infection than NS1-immunized TLR3KO mice and wild type mice. Thus, immunization against NS1 may reduce brain inflammation in a context of TLR3 signaling deficiency.

AB  - Natural Killer (NK) cells and Gamma-delta T cells are both innate lymphocytes that respond rapidly and non-specifically to viral infection and other pathogens. They are also known to form a unique link between innate and adaptive immunity. Although they have similar immune features and effector functions, accumulating evidence in mice and humans suggest these two cell types have distinct roles in the control of infection by West Nile virus (WNV), a re-emerging pathogen that has caused fatal encephalitis in North America over the past decade. This review will discuss recent studies on these two cell types in protective immunity and viral pathogenesis during WNV infection.

TI  - Role of Nonstructural Protein NS2A in Flavivirus Assembly
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 4731
EP  - 4741
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus nonstructural (NS) proteins are involved in RNA replication and modulation of the host antiviral response; however, evidence is mounting that some NS proteins also have essential roles in virus assembly. Kunjin virus (KUN) NS2A is a small, hydrophobic, transmembrane protein that is part of the replication complex and inhibits interferon induction. Previously, we have shown that an isoleucine (I)-to-asparagine (N) substitution at position 59 of the NS2A protein blocked the production of secreted virus particles in cells electroporated with viral RNA carrying this mutation. We now show that prolonged incubation of mutant KUN NS2A-I59N replicon RNA, in an inducible BHK-derived packaging cell line (expressing KUN structural proteins C, prM, and E), generated escape mutants that rescued the secretion of infectious virus-like particles. Sequencing identified three groups of revertants that included (i) reversions to wild-type, hydrophobic Ile, (ii) pseudorevertants to more hydrophobic residues (Ser, Thr, and Tyr) at codon 59, and (iii) pseudorevertants retaining Asn at NS2A codon 59 but containing a compensatory mutation (Thr-to-Pro) at NS2A codon 149. Engineering hydrophobic residues at NS2A position 59 or the compensatory T149P mutation into NS2A-I59N replicon RNA restored the assembly of secreted virus-like particles in packaging cells. T149P mutation also rescued virus production when introduced into the full-length KUN RNA containing an NS2A-I59N mutation. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy analyses of NS2A-I59N replicon-expressing cells showed a distinct lack of virus-induced membranes normally present in cells expressing wild-type replicon RNA. The compensatory mutation NS2A-T149P restored the induction of membrane structures to a level similar to those observed during wild-type replication. The results further confirm the role of NS2A in virus assembly, demonstrate the importance of hydrophobic residues at codon 59 in this process, implicate the involvement of NS2A in the biogenesis of virus-induced membranes, and suggest a vital role for the virus-induced membranes in virus assembly.

TI  - Role of Phosphatidylserine Receptors in Enveloped Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 4275
EP  - 4290
AB  - ABSTRACT We recently demonstrated that a soluble protein, Gas6, can facilitate viral entry by bridging viral envelope phosphatidylserine to Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on target cells. The interaction between phosphatidylserine, Gas6, and Axl was originally shown to be a molecular mechanism through which phagocytes recognize phosphatidylserine exposed on dead cells. Since our initial report, several groups have confirmed that Axl/Gas6, as well as other phosphatidylserine receptors, facilitate entry of dengue, West Nile, and Ebola viruses. Virus binding by viral envelope phosphatidylserine is now a viral entry mechanism generalized to many families of viruses. In addition to Axl/Gas6, various molecules are known to recognize phosphatidylserine; however, the effects of these molecules on virus binding and entry have not been comprehensively evaluated and compared. In this study, we examined most of the known human phosphatidylserine-recognizing molecules, including MFG-E8, TIM-1, -3, and -4, CD300a, BAI1, and stabilin-1 and -2, for their abilities to facilitate virus binding and infection. Using pseudotyped lentiviral vectors, we found that a soluble phosphatidylserine-binding protein, MFG-E8, enhances transduction. Cell surface receptors TIM-1 and -4 also enhance virus binding/transduction. The extent of enhancement by these molecules varies, depending on the type of pseudotyping envelope proteins. Mutated MFG-E8, which binds viral envelope phosphatidylserine without bridging virus to cells, but, surprisingly, not annexin V, which has been used to block phagocytosis of dead cells by concealing phosphatidylserine, efficiently blocks these phosphatidylserine-dependent viral entry mechanisms. These results provide insight into understanding the role of viral envelope phosphatidylserine in viral infection. IMPORTANCE Envelope phosphatidylserine has previously been shown to be important for replication of various envelope viruses, but details of this mechanism(s) were unclear. We were the first to report that a bifunctional serum protein, Gas6, bridges envelope phosphatidylserine to a cell surface receptor, Axl. Recent studies demonstrated that many envelope viruses, including vaccinia, dengue, West Nile, and Ebola viruses, utilize Axl/Gas6 to facilitate their entry, suggesting that the phosphatidylserine-mediated viral entry mechanism can be shared by various enveloped viruses. In addition to Axl/Gas6, various molecules are known to recognize phosphatidylserine; however, the effects of these molecules on virus binding and entry have not been comprehensively evaluated and compared. In this study, we examined most human phosphatidylserine-recognizing molecules for their abilities to facilitate viral infection. The results provide insights into the role(s) of envelope phosphatidylserine in viral infection, which can be applicable to the development of novel antiviral reagents that block phosphatidylserine-mediated viral entry.

TI  - Role of RNA-binding proteins during the late stages of Flavivirus replication cycle
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 17
AB  - The genus Flavivirus encompasses several worldwide-distributed arthropod-borne viruses including, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, Zika virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Infection with these viruses manifest with symptoms ranging from febrile illness to life- threatening hypotensive shock and encephalitis. Therefore, flaviviruses pose a great risk to public health. Currently, preventive measures are falling short to control epidemics and there are no antivirals against any Flavivirus. Flaviviruses carry a single stranded positive-sense RNA genome that plays multiple roles in infected cells: it is translated into viral proteins, used as template for genome replication, it is the precursor of the subgenomic flaviviral RNA and it is assembled into new virions. Furthermore, viral RNA genomes are also packaged into extracellular vesicles, e.g. exosomes, which represent an alternate mode of virus dissemination. Because RNA molecules are at the center of Flavivirus replication cycle, viral and host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical determinants of infection. Numerous studies have revealed the function of RBPs during Flavivirus infection, particularly at the level of RNA translation and replication. These proteins, however, are also critical participants at the late stages of the replication cycle. Here we revise the function of host RBPs and the viral proteins capsid, NS2A and NS3, during the packaging of viral RNA and the assembly of new virus particles. Furthermore, we go through the evidence pointing towards the importance of host RBPs in mediating cellular RNA export with the idea that the biogenesis of exosomes harboring Flavivirus RNA would follow an analogous pathway.

TI  - Role of autophagy during the replication and pathogenesis of common mosquito-borne flavi- and alphaviruses
JF  - Open Biology
VL  - 9
AB  - Arboviruses that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes represent one of the most important causes of febrile illness worldwide. In recent decades, we have witnessed a dramatic re-emergence of several mosquito-borne arboviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). DENV is currently the most common mosquito-borne arbovirus, with an estimated 390 million infections worldwide annually. Despite a global effort, no specific therapeutic strategies are available to combat the diseases caused by these viruses. Multiple cellular pathways modulate the outcome of infection by either promoting or hampering viral replication and/or pathogenesis, and autophagy appears to be one of them. Autophagy is a degradative pathway generally induced to counteract viral infection. Viruses, however, have evolved strategies to subvert this pathway and to hijack autophagy components for their own benefit. In this review, we will focus on the role of autophagy in mosquito-borne arboviruses with emphasis on DENV, CHIKV, WNV and ZIKV, due to their epidemiological importance and high disease burden.

JF  - FEMS immunology and medical microbiology
VL  - 53 2
SP  - 275
EP  - 83
AB  - gammadelta T cells respond rapidly following West Nile virus (WNV) infection, limiting viremia and invasion of the central nervous system and thereby protecting the host from lethal encephalitis. Here, we investigated the role of two major subpopulations of peripheral gammadelta T cells, Vgamma1(+) and Vgamma4(+) cells, in host immunity against WNV infection. We found initially that aged mice were more susceptible to WNV infection than young mice. Following WNV challenge, Vgamma1(+) cells in young mice expanded significantly whereas Vgamma4(+) cells expanded modestly. In contrast, aged mice exhibited a slower and reduced response of Vgamma1(+) cells but maintained a higher content of Vgamma4(+) cells. Vgamma1(+) cells were the major gammadelta subset producing IFN-gamma during WNV infection. Mice depleted of Vgamma1(+) cells had an enhanced viremia and higher mortality to WNV encephalitis. Vgamma4(+) cells had a higher potential for producing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a cytokine known to be involved in blood-brain barrier compromise and WNV entry into the brain. Depletion of Vgamma4(+) cells reduced TNF-alpha level in the periphery, accompanied by a decreased viral load in the brain and a lower mortality to WN encephalitis. These results suggest that Vgamma1(+) and Vgamma4(+) cells play distinct roles in protection and pathogenesis during WNV infection.

TI  - Roles of NS1 Protein in Flavivirus Pathogenesis.
JF  - ACS infectious diseases
AB  - Flaviviruses such as dengue, Zika, and West Nile viruses are highly concerning pathogens that pose significant risks to public health. The NS1 protein is conserved among flaviviruses and is synthesized as a part of the flavivirus polyprotein. It plays a critical role in viral replication, disease progression, and immune evasion. Post-translational modifications influence NS1's stability, secretion, antigenicity, and interactions with host factors. NS1 protein forms extensive interactions with host cellular proteins allowing it to affect vital processes such as RNA processing, gene expression regulation, and cellular homeostasis, which in turn influence viral replication, disease pathogenesis, and immune responses. NS1 acts as an immune evasion factor by delaying complement-dependent lysis of infected cells and contributes to disease pathogenesis by inducing endothelial cell damage and vascular leakage and triggering autoimmune responses. Anti-NS1 antibodies have been shown to cross-react with host endothelial cells and platelets, causing autoimmune destruction that is hypothesized to contribute to disease pathogenesis. However, in contrast, immunization of animal models with the NS1 protein confers protection against lethal challenges from flaviviruses such as dengue and Zika viruses. Understanding the multifaceted roles of NS1 in flavivirus pathogenesis is crucial for effective disease management and control. Therefore, further research into NS1 biology, including its host protein interactions and additional roles in disease pathology, is imperative for the development of strategies and therapeutics to combat flavivirus infections successfully. This Review provides an in-depth exploration of the current available knowledge on the multifaceted roles of the NS1 protein in the pathogenesis of flaviviruses.

TI  - Roles of the Endogenous Lunapark Protein during Flavivirus Replication
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells is a dynamic organelle, which undergoes continuous remodeling. At the three-way tubular junctions of the ER, the lunapark (LNP) protein acts as a membrane remodeling factor to stabilize these highly curved membrane junctions. In addition, during flavivirus infection, the ER membrane is invaginated to form vesicles (Ve) for virus replication. Thus, LNP may have roles in the generation or maintenance of the Ve during flavivirus infection. In this study, our aim was to characterize the functions of LNP during flavivirus infection and investigate the underlying mechanisms of these functions. To specifically study virus replication, we generated cell lines expressing replicons of West Nile virus (Kunjin strain) or Langat virus. By using these replicon platforms and electron microscopy, we showed that depletion of LNP resulted in reduced virus replication, which is due to its role in the generation of the Ve. By using biochemical assays and high-resolution microscopy, we found that LNP is recruited to the Ve and the protein interacts with the nonstructural protein (NS) 4B. Therefore, these data shed new light on the interactions between flavivirus and host factors during viral replication.

In this work, we identify STAT5 as a regulator of DC activation and antiviral immune responses downstream of innate immune signaling that was not activated during either WNV or Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. WNV and ZIKV actively blocked STAT5 phosphorylation downstream of RIG-I, IFN-β, and IL-4, but not GM-CSF, signaling. However, other related flaviviruses, dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 and the yellow fever 17D vaccine strain, did not antagonize STAT5 phosphorylation. Mechanistically, WNV and ZIKV showed differential inhibition of Jak kinases upstream of STAT5, suggesting divergent countermeasures to inhibit STAT5 activation. Combined, these findings identify STAT5 as a target of antagonism by specific pathogenic flaviviruses to subvert antiviral immune responses in human DCs. ABSTRACT Flaviviruses are a diverse group of arthropod-borne viruses responsible for numerous significant public health threats; therefore, understanding the interactions between these viruses and the human immune response remains vital. West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infect human dendritic cells (DCs) and can block antiviral immune responses in DCs. Previously, we used mRNA sequencing and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to define molecular signatures of antiviral DC responses following activation of innate immune signaling (RIG-I, MDA5, or type I interferon [IFN] signaling) or infection with WNV. Using this approach, we found that several genes involved in T cell cosignaling and antigen processing were not enriched in DCs during WNV infection. Using cis-regulatory sequence analysis, STAT5 was identified as a regulator of DC activation and immune responses downstream of innate immune signaling that was not activated during either WNV or ZIKV infection. Mechanistically, WNV and ZIKV actively blocked STAT5 phosphorylation downstream of RIG-I, IFN-β, and interleukin-4 (IL-4), but not granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), signaling. Unexpectedly, dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 (DENV1 to DENV4) and the yellow fever 17D vaccine strain (YFV-17D) did not antagonize STAT5 phosphorylation. In contrast to WNV, ZIKV inhibited JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylation following type I IFN treatment, suggesting divergent mechanisms used by these viruses to inhibit STAT5 activation. Combined, these findings identify STAT5 as a target of antagonism by specific pathogenic flaviviruses to subvert the immune response in infected DCs.

TI  - STING is required for host defense against neuropathological West Nile virus infection
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 15
AB  - West Nile Virus (WNV), an emerging and re-emerging RNA virus, is the leading source of arboviral encephalitic morbidity and mortality in the United States. WNV infections are acutely controlled by innate immunity in peripheral tissues outside of the central nervous system (CNS) but WNV can evade the actions of interferon (IFN) to facilitate CNS invasion, causing encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and death. Recent studies indicate that STimulator of INterferon Gene (STING), canonically known for initiating a type I IFN production and innate immune response to cytosolic DNA, is required for host defense against neurotropic RNA viruses. We evaluated the role of STING in host defense to control WNV infection and pathology in a murine model of infection. When challenged with WNV, STING knock out (-/-) mice displayed increased morbidity and mortality compared to wild type (WT) mice. Virologic analysis and assessment of STING activation revealed that STING signaling was not required for control of WNV in the spleen nor was WNV sufficient to mediate canonical STING activation in vitro. However, STING-/- mice exhibited a clear trend of increased viral load and virus dissemination in the CNS. We found that STING-/- mice exhibited increased and prolonged neurological signs compared to WT mice. Pathological examination revealed increased lesions, mononuclear cellular infiltration and neuronal death in the CNS of STING-/- mice, with sustained pathology after viral clearance. We found that STING was required in bone marrow derived macrophages for early control of WNV replication and innate immune activation. In vivo, STING-/- mice developed an aberrant T cell response in both the spleen and brain during WNV infection that linked with increased and sustained CNS pathology compared to WT mice. Our findings demonstrate that STING plays a critical role in immune programming for the control of neurotropic WNV infection and CNS disease.

TI  - Salivary gland morphology and virus transmission during long-term cytopathologic West Nile virus infection in Culex mosquitoes.
JF  - The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene
VL  - 76 1
SP  - 118
EP  - 28
AB  - The effect of long-term West Nile virus (WNV) infection on Culex salivary gland morphology and viability was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy during a four week period post-blood feeding. These studies showed that apoptosis and other cytopathologic changes occurred more frequently in WNV-infected mosquitoes compared with uninfected controls. The effect of long-term infection on WNV transmission was evaluated by titering virus in saliva over the same time period. Although the mean titer of WNV in mosquito saliva did not change significantly over time, the percentage of saliva samples containing WNV decreased. Because of the importance of saliva in blood meal acquisition and virus delivery, salivary gland pathology has the potential to affect mosquito feeding behavior and virus transmission. Results from this study add to a growing body of evidence that arbovirus infections in mosquito vectors can be cytopathic, and offer a potential mechanism for virus-induced cell death in mosquitoes.

TI  - Schlafen 11 Restricts Flavivirus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - We provide evidence that the cellular protein Schlafen 11 (Slfn11) impairs replication of flaviviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). However, replication of single-stranded negative RNA viruses was not affected. Specifically, Slfn11 decreases the infectivity of WNV potentially by preventing virus-induced modifications of the host tRNA repertoire that could lead to enhanced viral protein folding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Slfn11 is not the limiting factor of this novel broad antiviral pathway. ABSTRACT Schlafen 11 (Slfn11) is an interferon-stimulated gene that controls the synthesis of proteins by regulating tRNA abundance. Likely through this mechanism, Slfn11 has previously been shown to impair human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the expression of codon-biased open reading frames. Because replication of positive-sense single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA] viruses requires the immediate translation of the incoming viral genome, whereas negative-sense single-stranded RNA [(−)ssRNA] viruses carry at infection an RNA replicase that makes multiple translation-competent copies of the incoming viral genome, we reasoned that (+)ssRNA viruses will be more sensitive to the effect of Slfn11 on protein synthesis than (−)ssRNA viruses. To evaluate this hypothesis, we tested the effects of Slfn11 on the replication of a panel of ssRNA viruses in the human glioblastoma cell line A172, which naturally expresses Slfn11. Depletion of Slfn11 significantly increased the replication of (+)ssRNA viruses from the Flavivirus genus, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), but had no significant effect on the replication of the (−)ssRNA viruses vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Rhabdoviridae family) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (Phenuiviridae family). Quantification of the ratio of genome-containing viral particles to PFU indicated that Slfn11 impairs WNV infectivity. Intriguingly, Slfn11 prevented WNV-induced downregulation of a subset of tRNAs implicated in the translation of 11.8% of the viral polyprotein. Low-abundance tRNAs might promote optimal protein folding and enhance viral infectivity, as previously reported. In summary, this study demonstrates that Slfn11 restricts flavivirus replication by impairing viral infectivity. IMPORTANCE We provide evidence that the cellular protein Schlafen 11 (Slfn11) impairs replication of flaviviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). However, replication of single-stranded negative RNA viruses was not affected.

TI  - Secreted NS1 proteins of tick-borne encephalitis virus and West Nile virus block dendritic cell activation and effector functions
JF  - Microbiology Spectrum
VL  - 11
AB  - ABSTRACT The flavivirus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected cells into the circulation and the serum levels correlate with disease severity. The effect of secreted NS1 (sNS1) on non-infected mammalian immune cells is largely unknown. Here, we expressed recombinant sNS1 proteins of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) and investigated their effects on dendritic cell (DC) effector functions. Murine bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) showed reduced surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules and decreased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines when treated with sNS1 of TBEV or WNV prior to poly(I:C) stimulation. Transcriptional profiles of BMDCs that were sNS1-exposed prior to poly(I:C) stimulation showed two gene clusters that were downregulated by TBEV or WNV sNS1 and that were associated with innate and adaptive immune responses. Functionally, both sNS1 proteins modulated the capacity for BMDCs to induce specific T-cell responses as indicated by reduced IFN-γ levels in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after BMDC co-cultivation. In human monocyte-derived DCs, poly(I:C)-induced upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokine responses were even more strongly impaired by TBEV sNS1 or WNV sNS1 pretreatment than in the murine system. Our findings indicate that exogenous flaviviral sNS1 proteins interfere with DC-mediated stimulation of T cells, which is crucial for the initiation of cell-mediated adaptive immune responses in human flavivirus infections. Collectively, our data determine soluble flaviviral NS1 as a virulence factor responsible for a dampened immune response to flavivirus infections. IMPORTANCE The effective initiation of protective host immune responses controls the outcome of infection, and dysfunctional T-cell responses have previously been associated with symptomatic human flavivirus infections. We demonstrate that secreted flavivirus NS1 proteins modulate innate immune responses of uninfected bystander cells. In particular, sNS1 markedly reduced the capacity of dendritic cells to stimulate T-cell responses upon activation. Hence, by modulating cellular host responses that are required for effective antigen presentation and initiation of adaptive immunity, sNS1 proteins may contribute to severe outcomes of flavivirus disease.

JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 109
SP  - 18915
EP  - 18920
AB  - Although West Nile virus (WNV) and other arthropod-borne viruses are a major public health problem, the mechanisms of antiviral immunity in mosquitoes are poorly understood. Dicer-2, responsible for the RNAi-mediated response through the C-terminal RNase-III domain, also contains an N-terminal DExD/H-box helicase domain similar to mammalian RIG-I/MDA5 which, in Drosophila, was found to be required for activation of an antiviral gene, Vago. Here we show that the Culex orthologue of Vago (CxVago) is up-regulated in response to WNV infection in a Dicer-2–dependent manner. Further, our data show that CxVago is a secreted peptide that restricts WNV infection by activation of the Jak-STAT pathway. Thus, Vago appears to function as an IFN-like antiviral cytokine in mosquitoes.

VL  - 277

EP  - 47;discussion247-53
AB  - Flaviviruses are major arthropod-borne human pathogens responsible for life-threatening encephalitis, hepatitis and haemorrhagic fevers. These enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses encode a polyprotein precursor of about 3400 amino acids, processed into three structural and seven non-structural proteins. The non-structural glycoprotein NS1 is essential for flavivirus viability. During host-cell infection in vitro, NS1 is found associated with intracellular organelles as a requisite for its role in viral replication, or is transported to the cell surface where it may trigger specific signalling pathways. In addition, a secreted form of the protein is released from flavivirus-infected mammalian cells. We have previously shown that the NS1 protein circulates during the acute phase of the disease in the plasma of patients infected with dengue virus type 1 and have extended our retrospective studies to dengue type 2 and type 3 cohorts, confirming the value of the NS1 antigen as an alternative diagnostic marker. Interestingly, detection of the NS1 protein in yellow fever virus and West Nile virus infections suggests that NS1 secretion is a hallmark of human flavivirus infections. The objectives of our current studies are to define the biological properties of the secreted form of the NS1 protein, to evaluate its possible contribution to viral pathogenesis, and to validate this protein as a candidate target for passive immunoprophylaxis against flaviviruses.

TI  - Secretory pathways and multiple functions of nonstructural protein 1 in flavivirus infection
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 14
AB  - The genus Flavivirus contains a wide variety of viruses that cause severe disease in humans, including dengue virus, yellow fever virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a glycoprotein that encodes a 352-amino-acid polypeptide and has a molecular weight of 46–55 kDa depending on its glycosylation status. NS1 is highly conserved among multiple flaviviruses and occurs in distinct forms, including a dimeric form within the endoplasmic reticulum, a cell-associated form on the plasma membrane, or a secreted hexameric form (sNS1) trafficked to the extracellular matrix. Intracellular dimeric NS1 interacts with other NSs to participate in viral replication and virion maturation, while extracellular sNS1 plays a critical role in immune evasion, flavivirus pathogenesis and interactions with natural vectors. In this review, we provide an overview of recent research progress on flavivirus NS1, including research on the structural details, the secretory pathways in mammalian and mosquito cells and the multiple functions in viral replication, immune evasion, pathogenesis and interaction with natural hosts, drawing together the previous data to determine the properties of this protein.

TI  - Selective Blockade of Interferon-α and -β Reveals Their Non-Redundant Functions in a Mouse Model of West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 10
AB  - Although type I interferons (IFNs) were first described almost 60 years ago, the ability to monitor and modulate the functional activities of the individual IFN subtypes that comprise this family has been hindered by a lack of reagents. The major type I IFNs, IFN-β and the multiple subtypes of IFN-α, are expressed widely and induce their effects on cells by interacting with a shared heterodimeric receptor (IFNAR). In the mouse, the physiologic actions of IFN-α and IFN-β have been defined using polyclonal anti-type I IFN sera, by targeting IFNAR using monoclonal antibodies or knockout mice, or using Ifnb-/- mice. However, the corresponding analysis of IFN-α has been difficult because of its polygenic nature. Herein, we describe two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that differentially neutralize murine IFN-β or multiple subtypes of murine IFN-α. Using these mAbs, we distinguish specific contributions of IFN-β versus IFN-α in restricting viral pathogenesis and identify IFN-α as the key mediator of the antiviral response in mice infected with West Nile virus. This study thus suggests the utility of these new reagents in dissecting the antiviral and immunomodulatory roles of IFN-β versus IFN-α in murine models of infection, immunity, and autoimmunity.

TI  - Self-association features of NS1 proteins from different flaviviruses
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Flaviviruses comprise a large group of arboviral species that are distributed in several countries of the tropics, neotropics, and some temperate zones. Since they can produce neurological pathologies or vascular damage, there has been intense research seeking better diagnosis and treatments for their infections in the last decades. The flavivirus NS1 protein is a relevant clinical target because it is involved in viral replication, immune evasion, and virulence. Being a key factor in endothelial and tissue-specific modulation, NS1 has been largely studied to understand the molecular mechanisms exploited by the virus to reprogram host cells. A central part of the viral maturation processes is the NS1 oligomerization because many stages rely on these protein-protein assemblies. In the present study, the self-associations of NS1 proteins from Zika, Dengue, and West Nile viruses are examined through constant-pH coarse-grained biophysical simulations. Free energies of interactions were estimated for different oligomeric states and pH conditions. Our results show that these proteins can form both dimers and tetramers under conditions near physiological pH even without the presence of lipids. Moreover, pH plays an important role mainly controlling the regimes where van der Waals interactions govern their association. Finally, despite the similarity at the sequence level, we found that each flavivirus has a well-characteristic protein-protein interaction profile. These specific features can provide new hints for the development of binders both for better diagnostic tools and the formulation of new therapeutic drugs.

JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 189
SP  - 3150
EP  - 3158
AB  - Semaphorin 7A (Sema7A) is a membrane-associated/secreted protein that plays an essential role in connecting the vertebrate neuronal and immune systems. However, the role of Sema7A has not been elucidated in viral pathogenesis. In this study, we show that abrogation of Sema7A protects mice from lethal West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Mice lacking Sema7A showed increased survival, reduced viral burden, and less blood–brain barrier permeability upon WNV infection. Increased Sema7A levels were evident in murine tissues, as well as in murine cortical neurons and primary human macrophages upon WNV infection. Treatment with Sema7A Ab blocked WNV infection in both of these cell types. Furthermore, Sema7A positively regulates the production of TGF-β1 and Smad6 to facilitate WNV pathogenesis in mice. Collectively, these data elucidate the role of Sema7A in shared signaling pathways used by the immune and nervous systems during viral pathogenesis that may lead to the development of Sema7A-blocking therapies for WNV and possibly other flaviviral infections.

AB  - Flaviviruses encode seven non-structural proteins for which functions have not yet been described. The identification of the viral and possible host proteins which may be involved in flavivirus replication has been impeded by the fact that the viral replication complexes are tightly associated with endoplasmic reticular membranes within infected cells and that in vitro polymerase activity is associated with large membrane fragments. To facilitate further study of flavivirus replication complexes, selected ultrapure detergents were analysed for their effect on West Nile virus (WNV) in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and for their ability to release functional replication complexes from partially purified intracellular BHK-21 membrane fragments. A few previous reports indicated that flavivirus in vitro polymerase activity was sensitive to detergent treatment. The present study indicates that WNV polymerase activity is variably inhibited depending on the concentration and identity of the detergent used. Of the five detergents (Tween 20, maltoside, octylglucoside, lubrol PX and sodium deoxycholate) tested, sodium deoxycholate was the most efficient at releasing functional viral replication complexes from intracellular membranes.

TI  - Sequence-Specific Fidelity Alterations Associated with West Nile Virus Attenuation in Mosquitoes
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - High rates of error-prone replication result in the rapid accumulation of genetic diversity of RNA viruses. Recent studies suggest that mutation rates are selected for optimal viral fitness and that modest variations in replicase fidelity may be associated with viral attenuation. Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are unique in their requirement for host cycling and may necessitate substantial genetic and phenotypic plasticity. In order to more thoroughly investigate the correlates, mechanisms and consequences of arbovirus fidelity, we selected fidelity variants of West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) utilizing selection in the presence of a mutagen. We identified two mutations in the WNV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase associated with increased fidelity, V793I and G806R, and a single mutation in the WNV methyltransferase, T248I, associated with decreased fidelity. Both deep-sequencing and in vitro biochemical assays confirmed strain-specific differences in both fidelity and mutational bias. WNV fidelity variants demonstrated host-specific alterations to replicative fitness in vitro, with modest attenuation in mosquito but not vertebrate cell culture. Experimental infections of colonized and field populations of Cx. quinquefaciatus demonstrated that WNV fidelity alterations are associated with a significantly impaired capacity to establish viable infections in mosquitoes. Taken together, these studies (i) demonstrate the importance of allosteric interactions in regulating mutation rates, (ii) establish that mutational spectra can be both sequence and strain-dependent, and (iii) display the profound phenotypic consequences associated with altered replication complex function of flaviviruses.

TI  - Sequential conformational rearrangements in flavivirus membrane fusion
JF  - eLife
VL  - 3
AB  - The West Nile Virus (WNV) envelope protein, E, promotes membrane fusion during viral cell entry by undergoing a low-pH triggered conformational reorganization. We have examined the mechanism of WNV fusion and sought evidence for potential intermediates during the conformational transition by following hemifusion of WNV virus-like particles (VLPs) in a single particle format. We have introduced specific mutations into E, to relate their influence on fusion kinetics to structural features of the protein. At the level of individual E subunits, trimer formation and membrane engagement of the threefold clustered fusion loops are rate-limiting. Hemifusion requires at least two adjacent trimers. Simulation of the kinetics indicates that availability of competent monomers within the contact zone between virus and target membrane makes trimerization a bottleneck in hemifusion. We discuss the implications of the model we have derived for mechanisms of membrane fusion in other contexts. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04389.001

TI  - Shiftless inhibits flavivirus replication in vitro and is neuroprotective in a mouse model of Zika virus pathogenesis
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 118
AB  - Significance Flaviviruses are significant human pathogens and emerging infectious disease threats. A screen of interferon-inducible genes revealed Shiftless (SHFL) as a potent antiviral effector, inhibiting all Flaviviridae tested, including West Nile, Zika, dengue, yellow fever, and hepatitis C viruses. Mechanistic studies showed that SHFL inhibits viral replication at a point after translation of the incoming genome. In whole-body Shfl knockout (KO) mice, compared to wild-type mice, the Shfl KO mice were more susceptible to Zika virus. Notably, Shfl was uniquely required for controlling replication in the brain and spinal cord, demonstrating an unappreciated neuroprotective role for this effector in vivo. SHFL is a key antiviral effector that specifically inhibits flavivirus genome replication, and Shfl protects mice from Zika virus–induced neuropathogenesis. Flaviviruses such as Zika virus and West Nile virus have the potential to cause severe neuropathology if they invade the central nervous system. The type I interferon response is well characterized as contributing to control of flavivirus-induced neuropathogenesis. However, the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) effectors that confer these neuroprotective effects are less well studied. Here, we used an ISG expression screen to identify Shiftless (SHFL, C19orf66) as a potent inhibitor of diverse positive-stranded RNA viruses, including multiple members of the Flaviviridae (Zika, West Nile, dengue, yellow fever, and hepatitis C viruses). In cultured cells, SHFL functions as a viral RNA-binding protein that inhibits viral replication at a step after primary translation of the incoming genome. The murine ortholog, Shfl, is expressed constitutively in multiple tissues, including the central nervous system. In a mouse model of Zika virus infection, Shfl−/− knockout mice exhibit reduced survival, exacerbated neuropathological outcomes, and increased viral replication in the brain and spinal cord. These studies demonstrate that Shfl is an important antiviral effector that contributes to host protection from Zika virus infection and virus-induced neuropathological disease.

TI  - Signaling events evoked by domain III of envelop glycoprotein of tick-borne encephalitis virus and West Nile virus in human brain microvascular endothelial cells
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 12
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus and West Nile virus can cross the blood–brain barrier via hematogenous route. The attachment of a virion to the cells of a neurovascular unit, which is mediated by domain III of glycoprotein E, initiates a series of events that may aid viral entry. Thus, we sought to uncover the post-attachment biological events elicited in brain microvascular endothelial cells by domain III. RNA sequencing of cells treated with DIII of TBEV and WNV showed significant alteration in the expression of 309 and 1076 genes, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed activation of the TAM receptor pathway. Several genes that regulate tight-junction integrity were also activated, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, cell-adhesion molecules, claudins, and matrix metalloprotease (mainly ADAM17). Results also indicate activation of a pro-apoptotic pathway. TLR2 was upregulated in both cases, but MyD88 was not. In the case of TBEV DIII, a MyD88 independent pathway was activated. Furthermore, both cases showed dramatic dysregulation of IFN and IFN-induced genes. Results strongly suggest that the virus contact to the cell surface emanates a series of events namely viral attachment and diffusion, breakdown of tight junctions, induction of virus uptake, apoptosis, reorganization of the extracellular-matrix, and activation of the innate immune system.

EP  - 10629
AB  - ABSTRACT Point mutations that resulted in a substitution of the conserved 3′-penultimate cytidine in genomic RNA or the RNA negative strand of the self-amplifying replicon of the Flavivirus Kunjin virus completely blocked in vivo replication. Similarly, substitutions of the conserved 3′-terminal uridine in the RNA negative or positive strand completely blocked replication or caused much-reduced replication, respectively. The same preference for cytidine in the 3′-terminal dinucleotide was noted in reports of the in vitro activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for the other genera of Flaviviridae that also employ a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) template to initiate asymmetric semiconservative RNA positive-strand synthesis. The Kunjin virus replicon results were interpreted in the context of a proposed model for initiation of RNA synthesis based on the solved crystal structure of the RdRp of φ6 bacteriophage, which also replicates efficiently using a dsRNA template with conserved 3′-penultimate cytidines and a 3′-terminal pyrimidine. A previously untested substitution of the conserved pentanucleotide at the top of the 3′-terminal stem-loop of all Flavivirus species also blocked detectable in vivo replication of the Kunjin virus replicon RNA.

TI  - Single-cell RNA transcriptome analysis reveals CXCL16/CXCR6 as maintenance factors for CNS tissue resident T cells that drive synapse elimination during viral recovery
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Background Emerging RNA viruses that target the central nervous system (CNS) lead to cognitive sequelae in survivors. Studies in humans and mice infected with West Nile virus (WNV), a re-emerging RNA virus associated with learning and memory deficits, revealed microglial-mediated synapse elimination within the hippocampus. Moreover, CNS resident memory T (TRM) cells activate microglia, limiting synapse recovery and inducing spatial learning defects in WNV-recovered mice. The signals involved in T cell-microglia interactions are unknown. Methods Here, we examined the murine WNV-recovered forebrain using single-cell RNA sequencing to identify putative ligand-receptor pairs involved in intercellular communication between T cells and microglia. Clustering and differential gene analyses were followed by protein validation, genetic and antibody-based approaches utilizing an established murine model of WNV recovery in which microglia and complement promote ongoing hippocampal synaptic loss. Results Profiling of host transcriptome at 25 days post-infection revealed a shift in forebrain homeostatic microglia to activated subpopulations with transcriptional signatures that have previously been observed in studies of neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, CXCL16/CXCR6, a chemokine signaling pathway involved in TRM cell biology, was identified as critically regulating CXCR6 expressing CD8+ TRM cell numbers within the WNV-recovered forebrain. We demonstrate that CXCL16 is highly expressed by all myeloid cells, and its unique receptor, CXCR6, is highly expressed on all CD8+ T cells. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that CXCL16/CXCR6 is required not only for the maintenance of WNV-specific, CD8 TRM cells in the post-infectious CNS, but also contributes to their expression of TRM cell markers. Moreover, CXCR6+CD8+ T cells are required for glial activation and ongoing synapse elimination. Conclusions We provide a comprehensive assessment of the role of CXCL16/CXCR6 as an interaction link between microglia and CD8+ T cells that maintains forebrain TRM cells, microglial and astrocyte activation, and ongoing synapse elimination in virally recovered animals. We also show that therapeutic targeting of CXCL16 during recovery may reduce CNS CD8+ TRM cells.

AB  - Skin is a complex organ and the largest interface of the human body exposed to numerous stress and pathogens. Skin is composed of different cell types that together perform essential functions such as pathogen sensing, barrier maintenance and immunity, at once providing the first line of defense against microbial infections and ensuring skin homeostasis. Being inoculated directly through the epidermis and the dermis during a vector blood meal, emerging Dengue, Zika andWest Nile mosquito-borne viruses lead to the initiation of the innate immune response in resident skin cells and to the activation of dendritic cells, which migrate to the draining lymph node to elicit an adaptive response. This literature review aims to describe the inflammatory response and the innate immune signalization pathways involved in human skin cells during Dengue, Zika and West Nile virus infections.

TI  - Skin tropism during Usutu virus and West Nile virus infection: an amplifying and immunological role
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 98
AB  - ABSTRACT Usutu virus (USUV) and West Nile virus (WNV) are closely related emerging arboviruses belonging to the Flavivirus genus and posing global public health concerns. Although human infection by these viruses is mainly asymptomatic, both have been associated with neurological disorders such as encephalitis and meningoencephalitis. Since USUV and WNV are transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito, the skin represents the initial site of virus inoculation and provides the first line of host defense. Although some data on the early stages of WNV skin infection are available, very little is known about USUV. Herein, USUV-skin resident cell interactions were characterized. Using primary human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, an early replication of USUV during the first 24 hours was shown in both skin cells. In human skin explants, a high viral tropism for keratinocytes was observed. USUV infection of these models induced type I and III interferon responses associated with upregulated expression of various interferon-stimulated genes as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes. Among the four USUV lineages studied, the Europe 2 strain replicated more efficiently in skin cells and induced a higher innate immune response. In vivo, USUV and WNV disseminated quickly from the inoculation site to distal cutaneous tissues. In addition, viral replication and persistence in skin cells were associated with an antiviral response. Taken together, these results provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the early steps of USUV infection and suggest that the skin constitutes a major amplifying organ for USUV and WNV infection. IMPORTANCE Usutu virus (USUV) and West Nile virus (WNV) are closely related emerging Flaviviruses transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Since they are directly inoculated within the upper skin layers, the interactions between the virus and skin cells are critical in the pathophysiology of USUV and WNV infection. Here, during the early steps of infection, we showed that USUV can efficiently infect two human resident skin cell types at the inoculation site: the epidermal keratinocytes and the dermal fibroblasts, leading to the induction of an antiviral innate immune response. Moreover, following cutaneous inoculation, we demonstrated that both viruses can rapidly spread, replicate, and persist in all distal cutaneous tissues in mice, a phenomenon associated with a generalized skin inflammatory response. These results highlight the key amplifying and immunological role of the skin during USUV and WNV infection.

TI  - Small RNA sequencing of field Culex mosquitoes identifies patterns of viral infection and the mosquito immune response
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 13
AB  - Mosquito-borne disease remains a significant burden on global health. In the United States, the major threat posed by mosquitoes is transmission of arboviruses, including West Nile virus by mosquitoes of the Culex genus. Virus metagenomic analysis of mosquito small RNA using deep sequencing and advanced bioinformatic tools enables the rapid detection of viruses and other infecting organisms, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic to humans, without any precedent knowledge. In this study, we sequenced small RNA samples from over 60 pools of Culex mosquitoes from two major areas of Southern California from 2017 to 2019 to elucidate the virome and immune responses of Culex . Our results demonstrated that small RNAs not only allowed the detection of viruses but also revealed distinct patterns of viral infection based on location, Culex species, and time. We also identified miRNAs that are most likely involved in Culex immune responses to viruses and Wolbachia bacteria, and show the utility of using small RNA to detect antiviral immune pathways including piRNAs against some pathogens. Collectively, these findings show that deep sequencing of small RNA can be used for virus discovery and surveillance. One could also conceive that such work could be accomplished in various locations across the world and over time to better understand patterns of mosquito infection and immune response to many vector-borne diseases in field samples.

TI  - Specific Recognition of the 5′-Untranslated Region of West Nile Virus Genome by Human Innate Immune System
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - In the last few years, the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 proved the crucial importance of understanding how emerging viruses work and proliferate, in order to avoid the repetition of such a dramatic sanitary situation with unprecedented social and economic costs. West Nile Virus is a mosquito-borne pathogen that can spread to humans and induce severe neurological problems. This RNA virus caused recent remarkable outbreaks, notably in Europe, highlighting the need to investigate the molecular mechanisms of its infection process in order to design and propose efficient antivirals. Here, we resort to all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations to characterize the structure of the 5′-untranslated region of the West Nile Virus genome and its specific recognition by the human innate immune system via oligoadenylate synthetase. Our simulations allowed us to map the interaction network between the viral RNA and the host protein, which drives its specific recognition and triggers the host immune response. These results may provide fundamental knowledge that can assist further antivirals’ design, including therapeutic RNA strategies.

JF  - Analytical chemistry
VL  - 89 1
SP  - 862
EP  - 870
AB  - Interactions between nucleic acids and proteins are critical for many cellular processes, and their study is of utmost importance to many areas of biochemistry, cellular biology, and virology. Here, we introduce a new analytical method based on sedimentation velocity (SV) analytical ultracentrifugation, in combination with a novel multiwavelength detector to characterize such interactions. We identified the stoichiometry and molar mass of a complex formed during the interaction of a West Nile virus RNA stem loop structure with the human T cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1 related protein. SV has long been proven as a powerful technique for studying dynamic assembly processes under physiological conditions in solution. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, how the new multiwavelength technology can be exploited to study protein-RNA interactions, and show how the spectral information derived from the new detector complements the traditional hydrodynamic information from analytical ultracentrifugation. Our method allows the protein and nucleic acid signals to be separated by spectral decomposition such that sedimentation information from each individual species, including any complexes, can be clearly identified based on their spectral signatures. The method presented here extends to any interacting system where the interaction partners are spectrally separable.

TI  - Splenic macrophages are required for protective innate immunity against West Nile virus
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 13
AB  - Although the spleen is a major site for West Nile virus (WNV) replication and spread, relatively little is known about which innate cells in the spleen replicate WNV, control viral dissemination, and/or prime innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we tested if splenic macrophages (MΦs) were necessary for control of WNV infection. We selectively depleted splenic MΦs, but not draining lymph node MΦs, by injecting mice intravenously with clodronate liposomes several days prior to infecting them with WNV. Mice missing splenic MΦs succumbed to WNV infection after an increased and accelerated spread of virus to the spleen and the brain. WNV-specific Ab and CTL responses were normal in splenic MΦ-depleted mice; however, numbers of NK cells and CD4 and CD8 T cells were significantly increased in the brains of infected mice. Splenic MΦ deficiency led to increased WNV in other splenic innate immune cells including CD11b- DCs, newly formed MΦs and monocytes. Unlike other splenic myeloid subsets, splenic MΦs express high levels of mRNAs encoding the complement protein C1q, the apoptotic cell clearance protein Mertk, the IL-18 cytokine and the FcγR1 receptor. Splenic MΦ-deficient mice may be highly susceptible to WNV infection in part to a deficiency in C1q, Mertk, IL-18 or Caspase 12 expression.

AB  - During reaction to stress caused by viral infection, RNA granules are formed in order to protect mRNA. Stress granules (SG) and processing bodies (PB) provide cell homeostasis and mRNA stability. They are formed, for example, during polio virus and MRV (mammalian orthoreovirus) infections. Some viruses, such as influenza virus and HTLV-1 (Human T-lymphotropic virus 1), block the formation of granules. In addition, there are viruses like West Nile Virus, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) or human Herpes viruses, which influence the functioning of the granules.

TI  - Stress responses in flavivirus-infected cells: activation of unfolded protein response and autophagy
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 5
AB  - The Flavivirus is a genus of RNA viruses that includes multiple long known human, animal, and zoonotic pathogens such as Dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, or Japanese encephalitis virus, as well as other less known viruses that represent potential threats for human and animal health such as Usutu or Zika viruses. Flavivirus replication is based on endoplasmic reticulum-derived structures. Membrane remodeling and accumulation of viral factors induce endoplasmic reticulum stress that results in activation of a cellular signaling response termed unfolded protein response (UPR), which can be modulated by the viruses for their own benefit. Concomitant with the activation of the UPR, an upregulation of the autophagic pathway in cells infected with different flaviviruses has also been described. This review addresses the current knowledge of the relationship between endoplasmic reticulum stress, UPR, and autophagy in flavivirus-infected cells and the growing evidences for an involvement of these cellular pathways in the replication and pathogenesis of these viruses.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analyses of a Conserved Hydrophobic Pocket of Flavivirus Methyltransferase*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 285
SP  - 32586
EP  - 32595
AB  - The flavivirus methyltransferase (MTase) sequentially methylates the N7 and 2′-O positions of the viral RNA cap (GpppA-RNA → m7GpppA-RNA → m7GpppAm-RNA), using S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) as a methyl donor. We report here that sinefungin (SIN), an AdoMet analog, inhibits several flaviviruses through suppression of viral MTase. The crystal structure of West Nile virus MTase in complex with SIN inhibitor at 2.0-Å resolution revealed a flavivirus-conserved hydrophobic pocket located next to the AdoMet-binding site. The pocket is functionally critical in the viral replication and cap methylations. In addition, the N7 methylation efficiency was found to correlate with the viral replication ability. Thus, SIN analogs with modifications that interact with the hydrophobic pocket are potential specific inhibitors of flavivirus MTase.

JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 291
SP  - 15788
EP  - 15795
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a prototypical emerging virus for which no effective therapeutics currently exist. WNV uses programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to synthesize the NS1′ protein, a C terminally extended version of its non-structural protein 1, the expression of which enhances neuro-invasiveness and viral RNA abundance. Here, the NS1′ frameshift signals derived from four WNV strains were investigated to better understand −1 PRF in this quasispecies. Sequences previously predicted to promote −1 PRF strongly promote this activity, but frameshifting was significantly more efficient upon inclusion of additional 3′ sequence information. The observation of different rates of −1 PRF, and by inference differences in the expression of NS1′, may account for the greater degrees of pathogenesis associated with specific WNV strains. Chemical modification and mutational analyses of the longer and shorter forms of the −1 PRF signals suggests dynamic structural rearrangements between tandem stem-loop and mRNA pseudoknot structures in two of the strains. A model is suggested in which this is employed as a molecular switch to fine tune the relative expression of structural to non-structural proteins during different phases of the viral replication cycle.

TI  - Structural and Functional Properties of the Capsid Protein of Dengue and Related Flavivirus
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 20
AB  - Dengue, West Nile and Zika, closely related viruses of the Flaviviridae family, are an increasing global threat, due to the expansion of their mosquito vectors. They present a very similar viral particle with an outer lipid bilayer containing two viral proteins and, within it, the nucleocapsid core. This core is composed by the viral RNA complexed with multiple copies of the capsid protein, a crucial structural protein that mediates not only viral assembly, but also encapsidation, by interacting with host lipid systems. The capsid is a homodimeric protein that contains a disordered N-terminal region, an intermediate flexible fold section and a very stable conserved fold region. Since a better understanding of its structure can give light into its biological activity, here, first, we compared and analyzed relevant mosquito-borne Flavivirus capsid protein sequences and their predicted structures. Then, we studied the alternative conformations enabled by the N-terminal region. Finally, using dengue virus capsid protein as main model, we correlated the protein size, thermal stability and function with its structure/dynamics features. The findings suggest that the capsid protein interaction with host lipid systems leads to minor allosteric changes that may modulate the specific binding of the protein to the viral RNA. Such mechanism can be targeted in future drug development strategies, namely by using improved versions of pep14-23, a dengue virus capsid protein peptide inhibitor, previously developed by us. Such knowledge can yield promising advances against Zika, dengue and closely related Flavivirus.

TI  - Structural proteins of West Nile virus are a major determinant of infectious particle production and fitness in astrocytes
JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 95
SP  - 1991
EP  - 2003
AB  - The molecular basis for the increased resistance of astrocytes to a non-neuropathogenic strain of West Nile virus (WNV), WNV-MAD78, compared with the neuropathogenic strain WNV-NY remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the reduced susceptibility of astrocytes to WNV-MAD78 is due to a combination of both cellular activities as well as viral determinants. Analyses of the viral particle indicated that astrocyte-derived WNV-MAD78 particles were less infectious than those of WNV-NY. Additionally, inhibition of cellular furin-like proteases increased WNV-MAD78 infectious particle production in astrocytes, suggesting that high levels of furin-like protease activity within these cells acted in a cell- and strain-specific manner to inhibit WNV-MAD78 replication. Moreover, analysis of recombinant viruses indicated that the structural proteins of WNV-MAD78 were responsible for decreased particle infectivity and the corresponding reduction in infectious particle production compared with WNV-NY. Thus, the composition of the WNV virion was also a major determinant for viral fitness within astrocytes and may contribute to WNV propagation within the central nervous system. Whether the WNV-MAD78 structural genes reduce virus replication and particle infectivity through the same mechanism as the cellular furin-like protease activity or whether these two determinants function through distinct pathways remains to be determined.

TI  - Structurally Conserved Domains between Flavivirus and Alphavirus Fusion Glycoproteins Contribute to Replication and Infectious-Virion Production
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - Arboviruses are a significant global public health threat, yet there are no antivirals targeting these viruses. This problem is in part due to our lack of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the arbovirus life cycle. ABSTRACT Alphaviruses and flaviviruses have class II fusion glycoproteins that are essential for virion assembly and infectivity. Importantly, the tip of domain II is structurally conserved between the alphavirus and flavivirus fusion proteins, yet whether these structural similarities between virus families translate to functional similarities is unclear. Using in vivo evolution of Zika virus (ZIKV), we identified several novel emerging variants, including an envelope glycoprotein variant in β-strand c (V114M) of domain II. We have previously shown that the analogous β-strand c and the ij loop, located in the tip of domain II of the alphavirus E1 glycoprotein, are important for infectivity. This led us to hypothesize that flavivirus E β-strand c also contributes to flavivirus infection. We generated this ZIKV glycoprotein variant and found that while it had little impact on infection in mosquitoes, it reduced replication in human cells and mice and increased virus sensitivity to ammonium chloride, as seen for alphaviruses. In light of these results and given our alphavirus ij loop studies, we mutated a conserved alanine at the tip of the flavivirus ij loop to valine to test its effect on ZIKV infectivity. Interestingly, this mutation inhibited infectious virion production of ZIKV and yellow fever virus, but not West Nile virus. Together, these studies show that shared domains of the alphavirus and flavivirus class II fusion glycoproteins harbor structurally analogous residues that are functionally important and contribute to virus infection in vivo. IMPORTANCE Arboviruses are a significant global public health threat, yet there are no antivirals targeting these viruses. This problem is in part due to our lack of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the arbovirus life cycle. In particular, virus entry and assembly are essential processes in the virus life cycle and steps that can be targeted for the development of antiviral therapies. Therefore, understanding common, fundamental mechanisms used by different arboviruses for entry and assembly is essential. In this study, we show that flavivirus and alphavirus residues located in structurally conserved and analogous regions of the class II fusion proteins contribute to common mechanisms of entry, dissemination, and infectious-virion production. These studies highlight how class II fusion proteins function and provide novel targets for development of antivirals.

TI  - Structure and Function of Flavivirus NS5 Methyltransferase
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 3891
EP  - 3903
AB  - ABSTRACT The plus-strand RNA genome of flavivirus contains a 5′ terminal cap 1 structure (m7GpppAmG). The flaviviruses encode one methyltransferase, located at the N-terminal portion of the NS5 protein, to catalyze both guanine N-7 and ribose 2′-OH methylations during viral cap formation. Representative flavivirus methyltransferases from dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile virus (WNV) sequentially generate GpppA → m7GpppA → m7GpppAm. The 2′-O methylation can be uncoupled from the N-7 methylation, since m7GpppA-RNA can be readily methylated to m7GpppAm-RNA. Despite exhibiting two distinct methylation activities, the crystal structure of WNV methyltransferase at 2.8 Å resolution showed a single binding site for S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM), the methyl donor. Therefore, substrate GpppA-RNA should be repositioned to accept the N-7 and 2′-O methyl groups from SAM during the sequential reactions. Electrostatic analysis of the WNV methyltransferase structure showed that, adjacent to the SAM-binding pocket, is a highly positively charged surface that could serve as an RNA binding site during cap methylations. Biochemical and mutagenesis analyses show that the N-7 and 2′-O cap methylations require distinct buffer conditions and different side chains within the K61-D146-K182-E218 motif, suggesting that the two reactions use different mechanisms. In the context of complete virus, defects in both methylations are lethal to WNV; however, viruses defective solely in 2′-O methylation are attenuated and can protect mice from later wild-type WNV challenge. The results demonstrate that the N-7 methylation activity is essential for the WNV life cycle and, thus, methyltransferase represents a novel target for flavivirus therapy.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 8159
EP  - 8171
AB  - ABSTRACT Using a self-replicating reporting replicon of West Nile (WN) virus, we performed a mutagenesis analysis to define the structure and function of the 3′-terminal 6 nucleotides (nt) (5′-GGAUCUOH-3′) of the WN virus genome in viral replication. We show that mutations of nucleotide sequence or base pair structure of any of the 3′-terminal 6 nt do not significantly affect viral translation, but exert discrete effects on RNA replication. (i) The flavivirus-conserved terminal 3′ U is optimal for WN virus replication. Replacement of the wild-type 3′ U with a purine A or G resulted in a substantial reduction in RNA replication, with a complete reversion to the wild-type sequence. In contrast, replacement with a pyrimidine C resulted in a replication level similar to that of the 3′ A or G mutants, with only partial reversion. (ii) The flavivirus-conserved 3′ penultimate C and two upstream nucleotides (positions 78 and 79), which potentially base pair with the 3′-terminal CUOH, are absolutely essential for viral replication. (iii) The base pair structures, but not the nucleotide sequences at the 3rd (U) and the 4th (A) positions, are critical for RNA replication. (iv) The nucleotide sequences of the 5th (G) position and its base pair nucleotide (C) are essential for viral replication. (v) Neither the sequence nor the base pair structure of the 6th nucleotide (G) is critical for WN virus replication. These results provide strong functional evidence for the existence of the 3′ flavivirus-conserved RNA structure, which may function as contact sites for specific assembly of the replication complex or for efficient initiation of minus-sense RNA synthesis.

TI  - Structure and function of cis‐acting RNA elements of flavivirus
JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology
VL  - 30
AB  - The genus Flavivirus is a group of single‐stranded, positive‐sense RNA viruses that includes numerous human pathogens with global impact, such as dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). The approximately 11‐kilobase genome is flanked by highly structured untranslated regions (UTRs), which contain various cis‐acting RNA elements with unique structures and functions. Moreover, local RNA elements circularize the genome non‐covalently through long‐range interactions. Interestingly, many flavivirus cis‐acting RNA elements contain group‐specific motifs or are specific for the given phylogenetic groups, suggesting their potential association with flavivirus evolution and diversification. In this review, we summarize recent advances about the structure and function of cis‐acting RNA elements in flavivirus genomes and highlight the potential implications for flavivirus evolution. Finally, the scientific questions remained to be answered in the field are also discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT The structure of immature West Nile virus particles, propagated in the presence of ammonium chloride to block virus maturation in the low-pH environment of the trans-Golgi network, was determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structure of these particles was similar to that of immature West Nile virus particles found as a minor component of mature virus samples (naturally occurring immature particles [NOIPs]). The structures of mature infectious flaviviruses are radically different from those of the immature particles. The similarity of the ammonium chloride-treated particles and NOIPs suggests either that the NOIPs have not undergone any conformational change during maturation or that the conformational change is reversible. Comparison with the cryo-EM reconstruction of immature dengue virus established the locations of the N-linked glycosylation sites of these viruses, verifying the interpretation of the reconstructions of the immature flaviviruses.

TI  - Structure of an RNA G-quadruplex from the West Nile virus genome
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 15
AB  - Potential G-quadruplex sites have been identified in the genomes of DNA and RNA viruses and proposed as regulatory elements. The genus Orthoflavivirus contains arthropod-transmitted, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause significant human disease globally. Computational studies have identified multiple potential G-quadruplex sites that are conserved across members of this genus. Subsequent biophysical studies established that some G-quadruplexes predicted in Zika and tickborne encephalitis virus genomes can form and known quadruplex binders reduced viral yields from cells infected with these viruses. The susceptibility of RNA to degradation and the variability of loop regions have made structure determination challenging. Despite these difficulties, we report a high-resolution structure of the NS5-B quadruplex from the West Nile virus genome. Analysis reveals two stacked tetrads that are further stabilized by a stacked triad and transient noncanonical base pairing. This structure expands the landscape of solved RNA quadruplex structures and demonstrates the diversity and complexity of biological quadruplexes. We anticipate that the availability of this structure will assist in solving further viral RNA quadruplexes and provides a model for a conserved antiviral target in Orthoflavivirus genomes.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, West Nile virus (WNV) has posed a great threat to global human health due to its explosive spread. Studying the protein–protein interactions (PPIs) between WNV and human is beneficial for understanding the pathogenesis of WNV and the immune response mechanism of human against WNV infection at the molecular level. In this study, we identified the human target proteins which interact with WNV based on protein structure similarity, and then the interacting pairs were filtered by the subcellular co-localization information. As a result, a network of 3346 interactions was constructed, involving 6 WNV proteins and 1970 human target proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first predicted interactome for WNV-human. By analyzing the topological properties and evolutionary rates of the human target proteins, it was demonstrated that these proteins tend to be the hub and bottleneck proteins in the human PPI network and are more conserved than the non-target ones. Triplet analysis showed that the target proteins are adjacent to each other in the human PPI network, suggesting that these proteins may have similar biological functions. Further, the functional enrichment analysis indicated that the target proteins are mainly involved in virus process, transcription regulation, cell adhesion, and so on. In addition, the common and specific targets were identified and compared based on the networks between WNV-human and Dengue virus II (DENV2)-human. Finally, by combining topological features and existing drug target information, we identified 30 potential anti-WNV human targets, among which 11 ones were reported to be associated with WNV infection.

AB  - Summary Singh's Aedes albopictus mosquito cell line was infected with Sindbis and West Nile viruses in order to assess the ability of these invertebrate cells to produce interferon. The viruses grew well in the mosquito cells, producing titers of 106–108 PFU/ml throughout 10 days of incubation. Temperature affected virus growth; Sindbis virus grew approximately 10–fold more at 28° than at 36°. Culture fluids from 1 to 10 days of incubation at either temperature were assayed for interferon activity by the yield reduction assay method. Virus in fluids was inactivated by ultraviolet light or immune serum treatment in order to preserve any labile invertebrate interferon activity. No consistent reduction of yields of homologous or heterologous viruses were obtained at either incubation temperature of 28 or 36° at any of the times periods studied through 10 days after infection. Aedes alboptctus mosquito cells apparently produce no or very little interferon on infection with Sindbis or West Nile viruses.

TI  - Sub-genomic flaviviral RNA elements increase the stability and abundance of recombinant AAV vector transcripts
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 98
AB  - ABSTRACT Many viruses have evolved structured RNA elements that can influence transcript abundance and translational efficiency, and help evade host immune factors by hijacking cellular machinery during replication. Here, we evaluated the functional impact of sub-genomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) known to stall exoribonuclease activity, by incorporating these elements into recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) genome cassettes. Specifically, sfRNAs from Dengue, Zika, Japanese Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, Murray Valley Encephalitis, and West Nile viruses increased transcript stability and transgene expression compared to a conventional woodchuck hepatitis virus element (WPRE). Further dissection of engineered transcripts revealed that sfRNA elements (i) require incorporation in cis within the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of AAV genomes, (ii) require minimal dumbbell structures to exert the observed effects, and (iii) can stabilize AAV transcripts independent of 5′−3′ exoribonuclease 1 (XRN1)-mediated decay. Additionally, preliminary in vivo assessment of AAV vectors bearing sfRNA elements in mice achieved increased transcript abundance and expression in cardiac tissue. Leveraging the functional versatility of engineered viral RNA elements may help improve the potency of AAV vector-based gene therapies. IMPORTANCE Viral RNA elements can hijack host cell machinery to control stability of transcripts and consequently, infection. Studies that help better understand such viral elements can provide insights into antiviral strategies and also potentially leverage these features for therapeutic applications. In this study, by incorporating structured flaviviral RNA elements into recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector genomes, we show improved AAV transcript stability and transgene expression can be achieved, with implications for gene transfer.

AB  - In a previous study on the replication of Kunjin virus using immunoelectron microscopy (E. G. Westaway, J. M. Mackenzie, M. T. Kenney, M. K. Jones, and A. A. Khromykh, 1997, J. Virol. 71, 6650-6661), NS1 and NS3 were found associated with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) within vesicle packets (VP) in infected Vero cells, suggesting that these induced membrane structures may be the cytoplasmic sites of RNA replication. NS2B and NS3 (comprising the virus-encoded protease) were colocalized within distinct paracrystalline (PC) or convoluted membranes (CM), also induced in the cytoplasm, suggesting that these membranes are the sites of proteolytic cleavage. In this study we found by immunofluorescence (IF) that the small hydrophobic nonstructural proteins NS2A and NS4A were located in discrete foci in the cytoplasm of infected cells at both 16 and 24 h postinfection, partially coincident with dsRNA foci. In cryosections of infected cells at 24 h, NS2A was located by immunogold labeling primarily within VP, associated with labeled dsRNA. NS2A fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) bound strongly to the 3' untranslated region of Kunjin RNA and also to the proposed replicase components NS3 and NS5 in cell lysates. NS4A was localized by immunogold labeling within a majority of the virus-induced membranes, including VP, CM, and PC. GST-NS4A bound weakly to the 3' untranslated region of Kunjin RNA but was bound to NS4A strongly and to most of the other viral nonstructural proteins, including NS3 and NS5. Taken together the results indicate that the flavivirus replication complex includes NS2A and NS4A in the VP in addition to the previously identified NS1 and NS3.

TI  - Subgenomic flaviviral RNAs and human proteins: in silico exploration of anti-host defense mechanisms
JF  - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal
VL  - 23
SP  - 3527
EP  - 3536
AB  - Background Flaviviruses pose significant global health threats, infecting over 300 million people annually. Among their evasion strategies, the production of subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) from the 3’ UTR of viral genomes is particularly notable. These sfRNAs interact with human proteins, disrupting key cellular processes such as RNA splicing and the interferon response. Results Utilizing a comprehensive in silico approach with the catRAPID algorithm, we analyzed over 300,000 interactions between sfRNAs and human proteins derived from more than 8,000 flavivirus genomes, including Dengue, Zika, Yellow Fever, West Nile, and Japanese Encephalitis viruses. Our study not only validated known interactions but also revealed novel human proteins that could be involved in sfRNA-mediated host defense evasion, including helicases, splicing factors, and chemokines. We propose that sfRNAs function as molecular sponges, sequestering specific proteins indicative of sfRNA-forming regions across flaviviruses. These findings represent a valuable resource for diagnostic and therapeutic developments. Conclusions Our findings significantly expand the known interactome of sfRNAs with human proteins, underscoring their role in modulating host cellular pathways. By providing the first extensive atlas of sfRNA interactions, we offer new insights into how flaviviruses can manipulate host cellular machinery to facilitate viral survival and persistence. Intriguingly, we predict interaction with stress granules, a critical component of the cellular response to viral infection, suggesting a mechanism by which flaviviruses inhibit their formation to evade host defenses. This atlas not only serves as a resource for exploring therapeutic targets but also aids in the identification of sfRNA biomarkers for improved flavivirus diagnostics.

JF  - Biochemical Society transactions
VL  - 46 3
SP  - 609
EP  - 617
AB  - Viruses exploit host metabolic and defence machinery for their own replication. The flaviviruses, which include Dengue (DENV), Yellow Fever (YFV), Japanese Encephalitis (JEV), West Nile (WNV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, infect a broad range of hosts, cells and tissues. Flaviviruses are largely transmitted by mosquito bites and humans are usually incidental, dead-end hosts, with the notable exceptions of YFV, DENV and ZIKV. Infection by flaviviruses elicits cellular responses including cell death via necrosis, pyroptosis (involving inflammation) or apoptosis (which avoids inflammation). Flaviviruses exploit these mechanisms and subvert them to prolong viral replication. The different effects induced by DENV, WNV, JEV and ZIKV are reviewed. Host cell surface proteoglycans (PGs) bearing glycosaminoglycan (GAG) polysaccharides - heparan/chondroitin sulfate (HS/CS) - are involved in initial flavivirus attachment and during the expression of non-structural viral proteins play a role in disease aetiology. Recent work has shown that ZIKV-infected cells are protected from cell death by exogenous heparin (a GAG structurally similar to host cell surface HS), raising the possibility of further subtle involvement of HS PGs in flavivirus disease processes. The aim of this review is to synthesize information regarding DENV, WNV, JEV and ZIKV from two areas that are usually treated separately: the response of host cells to infection by flaviviruses and the involvement of cell surface GAGs in response to those infections.

TI  - Suppressors of Cytokine Signaling and Protein Inhibitors of Activated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcriptions As Therapeutic Targets in Flavivirus Infections.
JF  - Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research
AB  - Flaviviruses cause significant human diseases putting more than 400 million people at risk annually worldwide. Because of migration and improved transportation, these viruses can be found on all continents (except Antarctica). Although a majority of the viruses are endemic in the tropics, a few [West Nile virus (WNV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)] have shown endemicity in Europe and North America. Currently, there are vaccines for the Yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and TBEV, but there is no effective vaccine and/or therapy against all other flaviviruses. Although there are intensive efforts to develop vaccines for Zika viruses, dengue viruses, and WNVs, there is the need for alternative or parallel antiviral therapeutic approaches. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) and protein inhibitors of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STATs; PIAS), both regulatory proteins of the Janus kinase/STAT signaling pathway, have been explored as therapeutic targets in herpes simplex and vaccinia viruses, as well as in cancer therapy. In this review, we briefly describe the function of SOCS and PIAS and their therapeutic potential in flaviviral infections.

TI  - Sustained antiviral insulin signaling during West Nile virus infection results in viral mutations
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 14
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses or arboviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) pose significant threats to public health. It is imperative to develop novel methods to control these mosquito-borne viral infections. We previously showed that insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling (IIS)-dependent activation of ERK and JAK-STAT signaling has significant antiviral activity in insects and human cells. Continuous immune pressure can lead to adaptive mutations of viruses during infection. We aim to elucidate how IIS-signaling in mosquitoes selects for West Nile virus escape variants, to help formulate future transmission blocking strategies. We hypothesize that passage of WNV under activation of IIS will induce adaptive mutations or escape variants in the infecting virus. To test our hypothesis, WNV was serially passaged through Culex quinquefasciatus Hsu cells in the presence or absence of bovine insulin to activate IIS antiviral pressure. We sequenced WNV genes encoding for E, NS2B, NS3, and NS5 and identified variants in E and NS5 arising from IIS antiviral pressure. In parallel to the genetic analyses, we also report differences in the levels of virus replication and Akt activation in human cells and mosquitoes using virus passaged in the presence or absence of insulin. Finally, using adult Culex quinquefasciatus, we demonstrated the enhancement of immune response gene expression in virus-infected mosquitoes fed on insulin, compared to control. Notably, virus collected from insulin-fed mosquitoes contained a non-synonymous mutation in NS3. These results contribute towards achieving our long-term goal of manipulating mosquito IIS-dependent antiviral immunity to reduce WNV or other flavivirus transmission to mammalian hosts.

TI  - Symbiotic Wolbachia in mosquitoes and its role in reducing the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases: updates and prospects
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 14
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, West Nile virus, chikungunya, Zika fever, and filariasis have the greatest health and economic impact. These mosquito-borne diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical and sub-tropical areas. Due to the lack of effective vector containment strategies, the prevalence and severity of these diseases are increasing in endemic regions. Nowadays, mosquito infection by the endosymbiotic Wolbachia represents a promising new bio-control strategy. Wild-infected mosquitoes had been developing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), phenotypic alterations, and nutrition competition with pathogens. These reduce adult vector lifespan, interfere with reproduction, inhibit other pathogen growth in the vector, and increase insecticide susceptibility of the vector. Wild, uninfected mosquitoes can also establish stable infections through trans-infection and have the advantage of adaptability through pathogen defense, thereby selectively infecting uninfected mosquitoes and spreading to the entire population. This review aimed to evaluate the role of the Wolbachia symbiont with the mosquitoes (Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex) in reducing mosquito-borne diseases. Global databases such as PubMed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, and pro-Quest were accessed to search for potentially relevant articles. We used keywords: Wolbachia, Anopheles, Aedes, Culex, and mosquito were used alone or in combination during the literature search. Data were extracted from 56 articles’ texts, figures, and tables of the included article.

EP  - 16
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) infection is usually asymptomatic but can cause severe neurological disease and death, particularly in older patients, and how individual variations in immunity contribute to disease severity is not yet defined. Animal studies identified a role for several immunity-related genes that determine the severity of infection. We have integrated systems-level transcriptional and functional data sets from stratified cohorts of subjects with a history of WNV infection to define whether these markers can distinguish susceptibility in a human population. Transcriptional profiles combined with immunophenotyping of primary cells identified a predictive signature of susceptibility that was detectable years after acute infection (67% accuracy), with the most prominent alteration being decreased IL1B induction following ex vivo infection of macrophages with WNV. Deconvolution analysis also determined a significant role for CXCL10 expression in myeloid dendritic cells. This systems analysis identified markers of pathogenic mechanisms and offers insights into potential therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Systems-Biology Approaches to Discover Anti-Viral Effectors of the Human Innate Immune Response
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 3
SP  - 1112
EP  - 1130
AB  - Virus infections elicit an immediate innate response involving antiviral factors. The activities of some of these factors are, in turn, blocked by viral countermeasures. The ensuing battle between the host and the viruses is crucial for determining whether the virus establishes a foothold and/or induces adaptive immune responses. A comprehensive systems-level understanding of the repertoire of anti-viral effectors in the context of these immediate virus-host responses would provide significant advantages in devising novel strategies to interfere with the initial establishment of infections. Recent efforts to identify cellular factors in a comprehensive and unbiased manner, using genome-wide siRNA screens and other systems biology “omics” methodologies, have revealed several potential anti-viral effectors for viruses like Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile virus (WNV), and influenza virus. This review describes the discovery of novel viral restriction factors and discusses how the integration of different methods in systems biology can be used to more comprehensively identify the intimate interactions of viruses and the cellular innate resistance.

TI  - TLR8 Couples SOCS-1 and Restrains TLR7-Mediated Antiviral Immunity, Exacerbating West Nile Virus Infection in Mice
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 197
SP  - 4425
EP  - 4435
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic ssRNA flavivirus that can cause encephalitis, meningitis, and death in humans and mice. Human TLR7 and TLR8 and mouse TLR7 recognize viral ssRNA motifs and induce antiviral immunity. However, the role of mouse TLR8 in antiviral immunity is poorly understood. In this article, we report that TLR8-deficient (Tlr8−/−) mice were resistant to WNV infection compared with wild-type controls. Efficient WNV clearance and moderate susceptibility to WNV-mediated neuronal death in Tlr8−/− mice were attributed to overexpression of Tlr7 and IFN-stimulated gene-56 expression, whereas reduced expression of the proapoptotic gene coding Bcl2-associated X protein was observed. Interestingly, suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 directly associated with TLR8, but not with TLR7, indicating a novel role for TLR8 regulation of SOCS-1 function, whereas selective small interfering RNA knockdown of Socs-1 resulted in induced IFN-stimulated gene-56 and Tlr7 expression following WNV infection. Collectively, we report that TLR8 coupling with SOCS-1 inhibits TLR7-mediated antiviral immunity during WNV infection in mice.

TI  - TRIMming down Flavivirus Infections
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - Flaviviruses comprise a large number of arthropod-borne viruses, some of which are associated with life-threatening diseases. Flavivirus infections are rising worldwide, mainly due to the proliferation and geographical expansion of their vectors. The main human pathogens are mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including dengue virus, Zika virus, and West Nile virus, but tick-borne flaviviruses are also emerging. As with any viral infection, the body’s first line of defense against flavivirus infections is the innate immune defense, of which type I interferon is the armed wing. This cytokine exerts its antiviral activity by triggering the synthesis of hundreds of interferon-induced genes (ISGs), whose products can prevent infection. Among the ISGs that inhibit flavivirus replication, certain tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins have been identified. Although involved in other biological processes, TRIMs constitute a large family of antiviral proteins active on a wide range of viruses. Furthermore, whereas some TRIM proteins directly block viral replication, others are positive regulators of the IFN response. Therefore, viruses have developed strategies to evade or counteract TRIM proteins, and some even hijack certain TRIM proteins to their advantage. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge on the interactions between flaviviruses and TRIM proteins, covering both direct and indirect antiviral mechanisms.

TI  - Temperature, Viral Genetics, and the Transmission of West Nile Virus by Culex pipiens Mosquitoes
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 4
AB  - The distribution and intensity of transmission of vector-borne pathogens can be strongly influenced by the competence of vectors. Vector competence, in turn, can be influenced by temperature and viral genetics. West Nile virus (WNV) was introduced into the United States of America in 1999 and subsequently spread throughout much of the Americas. Previously, we have shown that a novel genotype of WNV, WN02, first detected in 2001, spread across the US and was more efficient than the introduced genotype, NY99, at infecting, disseminating, and being transmitted by Culex mosquitoes. In the current study, we determined the relationship between temperature and time since feeding on the probability of transmitting each genotype of WNV. We found that the advantage of the WN02 genotype increases with the product of time and temperature. Thus, warmer temperatures would have facilitated the invasion of the WN02 genotype. In addition, we found that transmission of WNV accelerated sharply with increasing temperature, T, (best fit by a function of T4) showing that traditional degree-day models underestimate the impact of temperature on WNV transmission. This laboratory study suggests that both viral evolution and temperature help shape the distribution and intensity of transmission of WNV, and provides a model for predicting the impact of temperature and global warming on WNV transmission.

TI  - Tetraspanins as Potential Therapeutic Candidates for Targeting Flaviviruses
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - Tetraspanin family of proteins participates in numerous fundamental signaling pathways involved in viral transmission, virus-specific immunity, and virus-mediated vesicular trafficking. Studies in the identification of novel therapeutic candidates and strategies to target West Nile virus, dengue and Zika viruses are highly warranted due to the failure in development of vaccines. Recent evidences have shown that the widely distributed tetraspanin proteins may provide a platform for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. In this review, we discuss the diversified and important functions of tetraspanins in exosome/extracellular vesicle biology, virus-host interactions, virus-mediated vesicular trafficking, modulation of immune mechanism(s), and their possible role(s) in host antiviral defense mechanism(s) through interactions with noncoding RNAs. We also highlight the role of tetraspanins in the development of novel therapeutics to target arthropod-borne flaviviral diseases.

TI  - The 2′,5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase 1b Is a Potent Inhibitor of West Nile Virus Replication Inside Infected Cells*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 281
SP  - 4624
EP  - 4637
AB  - The 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) proteins associated with endoribonuclease RNase L are components of the interferon-regulated OAS/RNase L system, which is an RNA decay pathway known to play an important role in the innate antiviral immunity. A large body of evidence suggests a critical role for the 1b isoform of the mouse Oas gene (Oas1b) in resistance to West Nile virus (WNV) infection in vivo. WNV is a positive, single-stranded RNA virus responsible for severe encephalitis in a large range of animal species and humans. To investigate the molecular basis for the sensitivity of WNV to the Oas1b antiviral pathway, we established a stable mouse fibroblastic cell clone that up-regulates Oas1b protein expression under the control of the Tet-Off expression system. We showed that murine cells respond to Oas1b expression by efficiently inhibiting WNV replication. The antiviral action of Oas1b was essentially restricted to the early stages in virus life cycle. We found that the inability of WNV to productively infect the Oas1b-expressing cells was attributable to a dramatic reduction in positive-stranded viral RNA level. Thus, Oas1b represents an antiviral pathway that exerts its inhibitory effect on WNV replication by preventing viral RNA accumulation inside infected cells.

JF  - Virology
VL  - 287 1
SP  - 49
EP  - 61
AB  - Cis-acting elements that regulate translation have been identified in the 3' noncoding regions (NCRs) of cellular and viral mRNAs. As one means of analyzing the effect on translation of the conserved 3' terminal RNA structure of the West Nile virus (WNV) genome, the translation efficiencies of chimeric mRNAs composed of a CAT reporter gene flanked by viral or nonviral 5' and 3' terminal sequences were compared. In vitro, the WNV 3'(+) stem loop (SL) RNA reduced the translation efficiencies of chimeric mRNAs with either viral or nonviral 5' NCRs, suggesting that a specific 3'-5' RNA-RNA interaction was not involved. In contrast, the 3' terminal sequence of a togavirus, rubella virus, enhanced translation efficiency. The WNV 3'(+)SL reduced translation efficiency both in cis and in trans and of both capped and uncapped chimeric mRNAs. We have previously reported that three cellular proteins bind specifically to the WNV 3'(+)SL RNA. Competition between the WNV 3'(+)SL and the 5' terminus of the chimeric mRNAs for proteins involved in translation initiation could explain the translation inhibition observed.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 1900
EP  - 1905
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses require complementarity between the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome for RNA replication. For mosquito-borne flaviviruses, the cyclization sequences (CS) and upstream of AUG region (UAR) elements at the genomic termini are necessary for viral RNA replication, and a third motif, the downstream of AUG region (DAR), was recently designated for dengue virus. The 3′ DAR sequence is also part of a hairpin (HP-3′SL), and both complementarity between 5′ and 3′ DAR motifs and formation of the HP-3′SL in the absence of the 5′ end are conserved among mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Using West Nile virus as a model, we demonstrate that 5′-3′ DAR complementarity and HP-3′SL formation are essential for viral RNA replication.

TI  - The Bacteriostatic Protein Lipocalin 2 Is Induced in the Central Nervous System of Mice with West Nile Virus Encephalitis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 679
EP  - 689
AB  - ABSTRACT Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is a bacteriostatic factor produced during the innate immune response to bacterial infection. Whether Lcn2 has a function in viral infection is unknown. We investigated the regulation and function of Lcn2 in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice during West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis. Lcn2 mRNA and protein were induced in the brain by day 5, and this induction increased further by day 7 postinfection but was delayed compared with the induction of the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene, retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) gene. The Lcn2 mRNA and protein were both found at high levels in the choroid plexus, vascular endothelium, macrophage/microglia, and astrocytes. However, some neuronal subsets contained Lcn2 protein but no detectable mRNA. In Lcn2 knockout (KO) mice, with the exception of CXC motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5), which was significantly more downregulated than in wild-type (WT) mice, expression levels of a number of other host response genes were similar in the two genotypes. The brain from Lcn2 and WT mice with WNV encephalitis contained similar numbers of infiltrating macrophages, granulocytes, and T cells. Lcn2 KO and WT mice had no significant difference in tissue viral loads or survival after infection with different doses of WNV. We conclude that Lcn2 gene expression is induced to high levels in a time-dependent fashion in a variety of cells and regions of the CNS of mice with WNV encephalitis. The function of Lcn2 in the host response to WNV infection remains largely unknown, but our data indicate that it is dispensable as an antiviral or immunoregulatory factor in WNV encephalitis.

TI  - The Capsid-Binding Nucleolar Helicase DDX56 Is Important for Infectivity of West Nile Virus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 5571
EP  - 5580
AB  - ABSTRACT Recent findings suggest that in addition to its role in packaging genomic RNA, the West Nile virus (WNV) capsid protein is an important pathogenic determinant, a scenario that requires interaction of this viral protein with host cell proteins. We performed an extensive multitissue yeast two-hybrid screen to identify capsid-binding proteins in human cells. Here we describe the interaction between WNV capsid and the nucleolar RNA helicase DDX56/NOH61. Coimmunoprecipitation confirmed that capsid protein binds to DDX56 in infected cells and that this interaction is not dependent upon intact RNA. Interestingly, WNV infection induced the relocalization of DDX56 from the nucleolus to a compartment in the cytoplasm that also contained capsid protein. This phenomenon was apparently specific for WNV, as DDX56 remained in the nucleoli of cells infected with rubella and dengue 2 viruses. Further analyses showed that DDX56 is not required for replication of WNV; however, virions secreted from DDX56-depleted cells contained less viral RNA and were 100 times less infectious. Together, these data suggest that DDX56 is required for assembly of infectious WNV particles.

TI  - The Complement System in Flavivirus Infections
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - The incidence of flavivirus infections has increased dramatically in recent decades in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, affecting hundreds of millions of people each year. The Flaviviridae family includes dengue, West Nile, Zika, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever viruses that are typically transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks, and cause a wide range of symptoms, such as fever, shock, meningitis, paralysis, birth defects, and death. The flavivirus genome is composed of a single positive-sense RNA molecule encoding a single viral polyprotein. This polyprotein is further processed by viral and host proteases into three structural proteins (C, prM/M, E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) that are involved in viral replication and pathogenicity. The complement system has been described to play an important role in flavivirus infection either by protecting the host and/or by influencing disease pathogenesis. In this mini-review, we will explore the role of complement system inhibition and/or activation against infection by the Flavivirus genus, with an emphasis on dengue and West Nile viruses.

TI  - The Composition of West Nile Virus Lipid Envelope Unveils a Role of Sphingolipid Metabolism in Flavivirus Biogenesis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 12041
EP  - 12054
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging zoonotic mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for outbreaks of febrile illness and meningoencephalitis. The replication of WNV takes place on virus-modified membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell, and virions acquire their envelope by budding into this organelle. Consistent with this view, the cellular biology of this pathogen is intimately linked to modifications of the intracellular membranes, and the requirement for specific lipids, such as cholesterol and fatty acids, has been documented. In this study, we evaluated the impact of WNV infection on two important components of cellular membranes, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, by mass spectrometry of infected cells. A significant increase in the content of several glycerophospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, plasmalogens, and lysophospholipids) and sphingolipids (ceramide, dihydroceramide, and sphingomyelin) was noticed in WNV-infected cells, suggesting that these lipids have functional roles during WNV infection. Furthermore, the analysis of the lipid envelope of WNV virions and recombinant virus-like particles revealed that their envelopes had a unique composition. The envelopes were enriched in sphingolipids (sphingomyelin) and showed reduced levels of phosphatidylcholine, similar to sphingolipid-enriched lipid microdomains. Inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase (which catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin into ceramide) by either pharmacological approaches or small interfering RNA-mediated silencing reduced the release of flavivirus virions as well as virus-like particles, suggesting a role of sphingomyelin-to-ceramide conversion in flavivirus budding and confirming the importance of sphingolipids in the biogenesis of WNV. IMPORTANCE West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus spread by mosquitoes that can infect multiple vertebrate hosts, including humans. There is no specific vaccine or therapy against this pathogen licensed for human use. Since the multiplication of this virus is associated with rearrangements of host cell membranes, we analyzed the effect of WNV infection on different cellular lipids that constitute important membrane components. The levels of multiple lipid species were increased in infected cells, pointing to the induction of major alterations of cellular lipid metabolism by WNV infection. Interestingly, certain sphingolipids, which were increased in infected cells, were also enriched in the lipid envelope of the virus, thus suggesting a potential role during virus assembly. We further verified the role of sphingolipids in the production of WNV by means of functional analyses. This study provides new insight into the formation of flavivirus infectious particles and the involvement of sphingolipids in the WNV life cycle.

TI  - The Dual Regulation of Apoptosis by Flavivirus
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death, which maintains cellular homeostasis by eliminating pathogen-infected cells. It contains three signaling pathways: death receptor pathway, mitochondria-mediated pathway, and endoplasmic reticulum pathway. Its importance in host defenses is highlighted by the observation that many viruses evade, hinder or destroy apoptosis, thereby weakening the host’s immune response. Flaviviruses such as Dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus utilize various strategies to activate or inhibit cell apoptosis. This article reviews the research progress of apoptosis mechanism during flaviviruses infection, including flaviviruses proteins and subgenomic flaviviral RNA to regulate apoptosis by interacting with host proteins, as well as various signaling pathways involved in flaviviruses-induced apoptosis, which provides a scientific basis for understanding the pathogenesis of flaviviruses and helps in developing an effective antiviral therapy.

JF  - Journal of Virology

EP  - 10447
AB  - ABSTRACT The cytoplasmic replication of positive-sense RNA viruses is associated with a dramatic rearrangement of host cellular membranes. These virus-induced changes result in the induction of vesicular structures that envelop the virus replication complex (RC). In this study, we have extended our previous observations on the intracellular location of West Nile virus strain Kunjin virus (WNVKUN) to show that the virus-induced recruitment of host proteins and membrane appears to occur at a pre-Golgi step. To visualize the WNVKUN replication complex, we performed three-dimensional (3D) modeling on tomograms from WNVKUN replicon-transfected cells. These analyses have provided a 3D representation of the replication complex, revealing the open access of the replication complex with the cytoplasm and the fluidity of the complex to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, we provide data that indicate that a majority of the viral RNA species housed within the RC is in a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) form.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 11416
EP  - 11425
AB  - ABSTRACT Virus recognition and response by the innate immune system are critical components of host defense against infection. Activation of cell-intrinsic immunity and optimal priming of adaptive immunity against West Nile virus (WNV), an emerging vector-borne virus, depend on recognition by RIG-I and MDA5, two cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) protein family that recognize viral RNA and activate defense programs that suppress infection. We evaluated the individual functions of RIG-I and MDA5 both in vitro and in vivo in pathogen recognition and control of WNV. Lack of RIG-I or MDA5 alone results in decreased innate immune signaling and virus control in primary cells in vitro and increased mortality in mice. We also generated RIG-I −/− × MDA5 −/− double-knockout mice and found that a lack of both RLRs results in a complete absence of innate immune gene induction in target cells of WNV infection and a severe pathogenesis during infection in vivo, similar to findings for animals lacking MAVS, the central adaptor molecule for RLR signaling. We also found that RNA products from WNV-infected cells but not incoming virion RNA display at least two distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) containing 5′ triphosphate and double-stranded RNA that are temporally distributed and sensed by RIG-I and MDA5 during infection. Thus, RIG-I and MDA5 are essential PRRs that recognize distinct PAMPs that accumulate during WNV replication. Collectively, these experiments highlight the necessity and function of multiple related, cytoplasmic host sensors in orchestrating an effective immune response against an acute viral infection.

TI  - The Flavivirus Non-Structural Protein 5 (NS5): Structure, Functions, and Targeting for Development of Vaccines and Therapeutics
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 12
AB  - Flaviviruses, including dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), yellow fever (YFV), and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) viruses, pose a significant global emerging threat. With their potential to cause widespread outbreaks and severe health complications, the development of effective vaccines and antiviral therapeutics is imperative. The flaviviral non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is a highly conserved and multifunctional protein that is crucial for viral replication, and the NS5 protein of many flaviviruses has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of interferon (IFN) signalling. In this review, we discuss the functions of NS5, diverse NS5-mediated strategies adopted by flaviviruses to evade the host antiviral response, and how NS5 can be a target for the development of vaccines and antiviral therapeutics.

TI  - The Genomic 3′ UTR of Flaviviruses Is a Translation Initiation Enhancer
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 23
AB  - Viruses rely on the cellular machinery of host cells to synthesize their proteins, and have developed different mechanisms enabling them to compete with cellular mRNAs for access to it. The genus Flavivirus is a large group of positive, single-stranded RNA viruses that includes several important human pathogens, such as West Nile, Dengue and Zika virus. The genome of flaviviruses bears a type 1 cap structure at its 5′ end, needed for the main translation initiation mechanism. Several members of the genus also use a cap-independent translation mechanism. The present work provides evidence that the WNV 5′ end also promotes a cap-independent translation initiation mechanism in mammalian and insect cells, reinforcing the hypothesis that this might be a general strategy of flaviviruses. In agreement with previous reports, we show that this mechanism depends on the presence of the viral genomic 3′ UTR. The results also show that the 3′ UTR of the WNV genome enhances translation of the cap-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, WNV 3′ UTR can be replaced by the 3′ UTR of other flaviviruses and the translation enhancing effect is maintained, suggesting a molecular mechanism that does not involve direct RNA-RNA interactions to be at work. In addition, the deletion of specific structural elements of the WNV 3′ UTR leads to increased cap-dependent and cap-independent translation. These findings suggest the 3′ UTR to be involved in a fine-tuned translation regulation mechanism.

AB  - ABSTRACT In previous studies, we showed that the cellular RNA-binding protein AUF1 supports the replication process of the flavivirus West Nile virus. Here we demonstrate that the protein also enables effective proliferation of dengue virus and Zika virus, indicating that AUF1 is a general flavivirus host factor. Further studies demonstrated that the AUF1 isoform p45 significantly stimulates the initiation of viral RNA replication and that the protein's RNA chaperone activity enhances the interactions of the viral 5′UAR and 3′UAR genome cyclization sequences. Most interestingly, we observed that AUF1 p45 destabilizes not only the 3′-terminal stem-loop (3′SL) but also 5′-terminal stem-loop B (SLB) of the viral genome. RNA structure analyses revealed that AUF1 p45 increases the accessibility of defined nucleotides within the 3′SL and SLB and, in this way, exposes both UAR cyclization elements. Conversely, AUF1 p45 does not modulate the fold of stem-loop A (SLA) at the immediate genomic 5′ end, which is proposed to function as a promoter of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). These findings suggest that AUF1 p45, by destabilizing specific stem-loop structures within the 5′ and 3′ ends of the flaviviral genome, assists genome cyclization and concurrently enables the RdRp to initiate RNA synthesis. Our study thus highlights the role of a cellular RNA-binding protein inducing a flaviviral RNA switch that is crucial for viral replication. IMPORTANCE The genus Flavivirus within the Flaviviridae family includes important human pathogens, such as dengue, West Nile, and Zika viruses. The initiation of replication of the flaviviral RNA genome requires a transformation from a linear to a cyclized form. This involves considerable structural reorganization of several RNA motifs at the genomic 5′ and 3′ ends. Specifically, it needs a melting of stem structures to expose complementary 5′ and 3′ cyclization elements to enable their annealing during cyclization. Here we show that a cellular RNA chaperone, AUF1 p45, which supports the replication of all three aforementioned flaviviruses, specifically rearranges stem structures at both ends of the viral genome and in this way permits 5′-3′ interactions of cyclization elements. Thus, AUF1 p45 triggers the RNA switch in the flaviviral genome that is crucial for viral replication. These findings represent an important example of how cellular (host) factors promote the propagation of RNA viruses.

TI  - The Host Response to West Nile Virus Infection Limits Viral Spread through the Activation of the Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 Pathway
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78

EP  - 7747
AB  - ABSTRACT Recent outbreaks of West Nile Virus (WNV) have been associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality in humans, birds, and many other species. We have initiated studies to define the molecular mechanisms by which a recent pathogenic isolate of WNV evades the host cell innate antiviral response. Biochemical and microarray analyses demonstrated that WNV induced the expression of beta interferon (IFN-β) and several IFN-stimulated genes late in infection of cultured human cells. The late expression of these antiviral genes was due to the delayed activation of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Despite this host response, WNV was still able to replicate efficiently. The effect of the IRF-3 pathway on WNV replication was assessed by examining virus replication and spread in cultures of wild-type or IRF-3-null mouse embryo fibroblasts. The absence of IRF-3 was marked by a significant increase in plaque size and a sustained production of infectious particles. Although the activation of the IRF-3 pathway was not sufficient to block virus replication, our results suggest that IRF-3 target genes function to constrain WNV infection and limit cell-to-cell virus spread.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83

EP  - 9338
AB  - ABSTRACT Sterile alpha and HEAT/Armadillo motif (SARM) is a highly conserved Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-containing adaptor protein that is believed to negatively regulate signaling of the pathogen recognition receptors Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR4. To test its physiological function in the context of a microbial infection, we generated SARM−/− mice and evaluated the impact of this deficiency on the pathogenesis of West Nile virus (WNV), a neurotropic flavivirus that requires TLR signaling to restrict infection. Although SARM was preferentially expressed in cells of the central nervous system (CNS), studies with primary macrophages, neurons, or astrocytes showed no difference in viral growth kinetics. In contrast, viral replication was increased specifically in the brainstem of SARM−/− mice, and this was associated with enhanced mortality after inoculation with a virulent WNV strain. A deficiency of SARM was also linked to reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), decreased microglia activation, and increased neuronal death in the brainstem after WNV infection. Thus, SARM appears to be unique among the TIR adaptor molecules, since it functions to restrict viral infection and neuronal injury in a brain region-specific manner, possibly by modulating the activation of resident CNS inflammatory cells.

TI  - The Immune Responses of the Animal Hosts of West Nile Virus: A Comparison of Insects, Birds, and Mammals
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - Vector-borne diseases, including arboviruses, pose a serious threat to public health worldwide. Arboviruses of the flavivirus genus, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus, yellow fever virus (YFV), and West Nile virus (WNV), are transmitted to humans from insect vectors and can cause serious disease. In 2017, over 2,000 reported cases of WNV virus infection occurred in the United States, with two-thirds of cases classified as neuroinvasive. WNV transmission cycles through two different animal populations: birds and mosquitoes. Mammals, particularly humans and horses, can become infected through mosquito bites and represent dead-end hosts of WNV infection. Because WNV can infect diverse species, research on this arbovirus has investigated the host response in mosquitoes, birds, humans, and horses. With the growing geographical range of the WNV mosquito vector and increased human exposure, improved surveillance and treatment of the infection will enhance public health in areas where WNV is endemic. In this review, we survey the bionomics of mosquito species involved in Nearctic WNV transmission. Subsequently, we describe the known immune response pathways that counter WNV infection in insects, birds, and mammals, as well as the mechanisms known to curb viral infection. Moreover, we discuss the bacterium Wolbachia and its involvement in reducing flavivirus titer in insects. Finally, we highlight the similarities of the known immune pathways and identify potential targets for future studies aimed at improving antiviral therapeutic and vaccination design.

TI  - The Immunopathogenesis of Neurotropic Flavivirus Infection
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - The flavivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family comprises over 70 species, most of which are tickor mosquito-borne. They are single-stranded, plus-sense RNA viruses, responsible for significant human and animal morbidity and mortality on all inhabited continents. Medically important viscerotropic flaviviruses include dengue, found equatorially across the world, and the prototypic yellow fever virus, found in Africa and South America. Neurotropic members include tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in Europe, West Nile virus (WNV) in Africa, parts of Europe and the Indian subcontinent, as well as the USA, St Louis encephalitis virus in the USA, and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) and Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) viruses in Australasia. Many of these have a history of emergence and re-emergence; indeed, following a novel outbreak in 1999 in New York (Lanciotti et al., 1999; CDC, 2010), WNV spread virtually throughout the Americas in less than 10 years and is the most common cause of meningoencephalitis in North America. WNV is now perhaps the most widely spread of all flaviviruses and may comprise 4 or more lineages, based on isolate homologies (C.G. Hayes, 2001; Bakonyi et al., 2005; Vazquez et al., 2010), with Lineage I and II well-defined and of obvious clinical importance in animals and humans (E.B. Hayes et al., 2005; Venter et al., 2009). WNV was first isolated in 1937 in the West Nile region of Uganda (Smithburn et al., 1940). It is a member of the Japanese encephalitis serogroup, together with JEV, Murray Valley and Saint Louis encephalitis viruses (Poidinger et al., 1996). These viruses are usually propagated in a zoonotic cycle between mosquitoes and amplifying hosts, particularly birds (or pigs in the case of JEV), with humans being incidental, since they may not develop high enough virus titres to infect arthropod vectors (C.G. Hayes, 2001). Rare cases of human-to-human WNV transmission have been documented via organ transplants and blood transfusion, as well as vertical transmission to the foetus in utero (Iwamoto et al., 2003; Lindsey et al., 2009). Although less than one percent of WNV infections develop neuroinvasive disease, in some 60% of patients presenting with central nervous system (CNS) symptoms denoting neuroinvasive disease, life-threatening encephalitis supervenes (Samuel & Diamond, 2009).

AB  - Mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue, West Nile and chikungunya viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality in human populations. Since current methods are not sufficient to control disease occurrence, novel methods to control transmission of arboviruses would be beneficial. Recent studies have shown that virus infection and transmission in insects can be impeded by co-infection with the bacterium Wolbachia pipientis. Wolbachia is a maternally inherited endosymbiont that is commonly found in insects, including a number of mosquito vector species. In Drosophila, Wolbachia mediates antiviral protection against a broad range of RNA viruses. This discovery pointed to a potential strategy to interfere with mosquito transmission of arboviruses by artificially infecting mosquitoes with Wolbachia. This review outlines research on the prevalence of Wolbachia in mosquito vector species and the impact of antiviral effects in both naturally and artificially Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.

AB  - ABSTRACT Cleavage of the flavivirus prM protein by a cellular furin-like protease is a hallmark of virion maturation. While this cleavage is a required step in the viral life cycle, it can be inefficient. Virions that retain uncleaved prM may be infectious. We investigated whether cleavage by furin of prM on partially mature West Nile virus (WNV) during virus entry contributes to infectivity. Using quantitative assays of WNV infection, we found that virions incorporating considerable amounts of uncleaved prM protein were insensitive to treatment of cells with a potent inhibitor of furin activity. Thus, partially mature WNV does not require furin-like proteases for infectivity.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 12125
EP  - 12138
AB  - ABSTRACT Type I interferons (IFN-α/β) control viral infection by triggering the expression of genes that restrict transcription, translation, replication, and assembly. Many viruses induce IFN responses after recognition by cytoplasmic or endosomal RNA sensors (RIG-I-like RNA helicases [RLR] and Toll-like receptors [TLR]), which signal through the cognate adaptor signaling molecules IPS-1, TRIF, and MyD88. Recent studies have demonstrated that IPS-1-dependent induction of IFN-α/β downstream of RLR recognition restricts West Nile virus (WNV) infection in many cell types, whereas TRIF-dependent TLR3 signaling limits WNV replication in neurons. Here, we examined the contribution of MyD88 signaling to the control of WNV by evaluating IFN induction and virus replication in genetically deficient cells and mice. MyD88−/− mice showed increased lethality after WNV infection and elevated viral burden primarily in the brain, even though little effect on the systemic type I IFN response was observed. Intracranial inoculation studies corroborated these findings, as WNV spread more rapidly in the central nervous system of MyD88−/− mice, and this phenotype preceded the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes. In vitro, increased WNV replication was observed in MyD88−/− macrophages and subsets of neurons but not in myeloid dendritic cells. MyD88 had an independent effect on recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages and T cells into the brain that was associated with blunted induction of the chemokines that attract leukocytes. Our experiments suggest that MyD88 restricts WNV by inhibiting replication in subsets of cells and modulating expression of chemokines that regulate immune cell migration into the central nervous system.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes annual epidemics of encephalitic disease throughout the world. Despite the ongoing risk to public health, no approved vaccines or therapies exist for use in humans to prevent or combat WNV infection. The innate immune response is critical for controlling WNV replication, limiting virus-induced pathology, and programming protective humoral and cell-mediated immunity to WNV infection. The RIG-I like receptors, Toll-like receptors, and Nod-like receptors detect and respond to WNV by inducing a potent antiviral defense program, characterized by production of type I IFN, IL-1β and expression of antiviral effector genes. Recent research efforts have focused on uncovering the mechanisms of innate immune sensing, antiviral effector genes that inhibit WNV, and countermeasures employed by WNV to antagonize innate immune cellular defenses. In this review, we highlight the major research findings pertaining to innate immune regulation of WNV infection.

AB  - Diseases caused by arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), such as Dengue, West Nile, and Chikungunya, constitute a major global health burden and are increasing in incidence and geographic range. The natural microbiota of insect vectors influences various aspects of host biology, such as nutrition, reproduction, metabolism, and immunity, and recent studies have highlighted the ability of insect-associated bacteria to reduce vector competence for arboviruses and other pathogens. This reduction can occur through mechanisms, such as immune response activation, resource competition, or the production of anti-viral molecules. Studying the interactions between insect vectors and their microbiota is an important step toward developing alternative strategies for arbovirus transmission control.

AB  - ABSTRACT Type I interferon (IFN) signaling coordinates an early antiviral program in infected and uninfected cells by inducing IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that modulate viral entry, replication, and assembly. However, the specific antiviral functions in vivo of most ISGs remain unknown. Here, we examined the contribution of the ISG viperin to the control of West Nile virus (WNV) in genetically deficient cells and mice. While modest increases in levels of WNV replication were observed for primary viperin −/− macrophages and dendritic cells, no appreciable differences were detected in deficient embryonic cortical neurons or fibroblasts. In comparison, viperin−/− adult mice infected with WNV via the subcutaneous or intracranial route showed increased lethality and/or enhanced viral replication in central nervous system (CNS) tissues. In the CNS, viperin expression was induced in both WNV-infected and adjacent uninfected cells, including activated leukocytes at the site of infection. Our experiments suggest that viperin restricts the infection of WNV in a tissue- and cell-type-specific manner and may be an important ISG for controlling viral infections that cause CNS disease.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 2600
EP  - 2615
AB  - ABSTRACT The mammalian host responds to viral infections by inducing expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). While the functional significance of many ISGs has yet to be determined, their cell type and temporal nature of expression suggest unique activities against specific pathogens. Using a combination of ectopic expression and gene silencing approaches in cell culture, we previously identified Ifi27l2a as a candidate antiviral ISG within neuronal subsets of the central nervous system (CNS) that restricts infection by West Nile virus (WNV), an encephalitic flavivirus of global concern. To investigate the physiological relevance of Ifi27l2a in the context of viral infection, we generated Ifi27l2a −/− mice. Although adult mice lacking Ifi27l2a were more vulnerable to lethal WNV infection, the viral burden was greater only within the CNS, particularly in the brain stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Within neurons of the cerebellum and brain stem, in the context of WNV infection, a deficiency of Ifi27l2a was associated with less cell death, which likely contributed to sustained viral replication and higher titers in these regions. Infection studies in a primary cell culture revealed that Ifi27l2a −/− cerebellar granule cell neurons and macrophages but not cerebral cortical neurons, embryonic fibroblasts, or dendritic cells sustained higher levels of WNV infection than wild-type cells and that this difference was greater under conditions of beta interferon (IFN-β) pretreatment. Collectively, these findings suggest that Ifi27l2a has an antiviral phenotype in subsets of cells and that at least some ISGs have specific inhibitory functions in restricted tissues. IMPORTANCE The interferon-stimulated Ifi27l2a gene is expressed differentially within the central nervous system upon interferon stimulation or viral infection. Prior studies in cell culture suggested an antiviral role for Ifi27l2a during infection by West Nile virus (WNV). To characterize its antiviral activity in vivo, we generated mice with a targeted gene deletion of Ifi27l2a. Based on extensive virological analyses, we determined that Ifi27l2a protects mice from WNV-induced mortality by contributing to the control of infection of the hindbrain and spinal cord, possibly by regulating cell death of neurons. This antiviral activity was validated in granule cell neurons derived from the cerebellum and in macrophages but was not observed in other cell types. Collectively, these data suggest that Ifi27l2a contributes to innate immune restriction of WNV in a cell-type- and tissue-specific manner.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 8212
EP  - 8225
AB  - ABSTRACT The interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) family of proteins inhibit infection of several different enveloped viruses in cell culture by virtue of their ability to restrict entry and fusion from late endosomes. As few studies have evaluated the importance of Ifitm3 in vivo in restricting viral pathogenesis, we investigated its significance as an antiviral gene against West Nile virus (WNV), an encephalitic flavivirus, in cells and mice. Ifitm3 −/− mice were more vulnerable to lethal WNV infection, and this was associated with greater virus accumulation in peripheral organs and central nervous system tissues. As no difference in viral burden in the brain or spinal cord was observed after direct intracranial inoculation, Ifitm3 likely functions as an antiviral protein in nonneuronal cells. Consistent with this, Ifitm3 −/− fibroblasts but not dendritic cells resulted in higher yields of WNV in multistep growth analyses. Moreover, transcomplementation experiments showed that Ifitm3 inhibited WNV infection independently of Ifitm1, Ifitm2, Ifitm5, and Ifitm6. Beyond a direct effect on viral infection in cells, analysis of the immune response in WNV-infected Ifitm3 −/− mice showed decreases in the total number of B cells, CD4+ T cells, and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Finally, bone marrow chimera experiments demonstrated that Ifitm3 functioned in both radioresistant and radiosensitive cells, as higher levels of WNV were observed in the brain only when Ifitm3 was absent from both compartments. Our analyses suggest that Ifitm3 restricts WNV pathogenesis likely through multiple mechanisms, including the direct control of infection in subsets of cells. IMPORTANCE As part of the mammalian host response to viral infections, hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are induced. The inhibitory activity of individual ISGs varies depending on the specific cell type and viral pathogen. Among ISGs, the genes encoding interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) have been reported to inhibit multiple families of viruses in cell culture. However, few reports have evaluated the impact of IFITM genes on viral pathogenesis in vivo. In this study, we characterized the antiviral activity of Ifitm3 against West Nile virus (WNV), an encephalitic flavivirus, using mice with a targeted gene deletion of Ifitm3. Based on extensive virological and immunological analyses, we determined that Ifitm3 protects mice from WNV-induced mortality by restricting virus accumulation in peripheral organs and, subsequently, in central nervous system tissues. Our data suggest that Ifitm3 restricts WNV pathogenesis by multiple mechanisms and functions in part by controlling infection in different cell types.

AB  - Mammalian cell-derived West Nile virus preferentially infects cells expressing the C-type lectin CD209L (dendritic cellspecific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin-related protein; liver- and lymph node-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin) but not cells expressing CD209 (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin). In contrast, Dengue virus infection is enhanced in cells expressing either attachment factor. The West Nile virus envelope (E) protein contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at residue 154, whereas Dengue virus E contains sites at residues 153 and 67. We introduced a glycosylation site at position 67 into West Nile virus E. Reporter virus particles pseudotyped with this E protein infected cells using either CD209 or CD209L. We also introduced glycosylation sites at several novel positions. All sites allowed CD209L-mediated infection, but only a subset promoted CD209 use. As seen for other viruses, mannose-rich glycans on West Nile virus were required for its interactions with CD209. Surprisingly, however, mannose-rich glycans were not required for CD209L-mediated infection. Complex glycans, particularly N-acetylglucosamine-terminated structures, were able to mediate reporter virus particle interactions with CD209L. We propose that CD209L recognizes glycosylated flaviviruses with broad specificity, whereas CD209 is selective for flaviviruses bearing mannose-rich glycans. The location of the N-linked glycosylation sites on a virion determines the types of glycans incorporated, thus controlling viral tropism for CD209-expressing cells.

TI  - The Many Faces of the Flavivirus NS5 Protein in Antagonism of Type I Interferon Signaling
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT The vector-borne flaviviruses cause severe disease in humans on every inhabited continent on earth. Their transmission by arthropods, particularly mosquitoes, facilitates large emergence events such as witnessed with Zika virus (ZIKV) or West Nile virus in the Americas. Every vector-borne flavivirus examined thus far that causes disease in humans, from dengue virus to ZIKV, antagonizes the host type I interferon (IFN-I) response by preventing JAK-STAT signaling, suggesting that suppression of this pathway is an important determinant of infection. The most direct and potent viral inhibitor of this pathway is the nonstructural protein NS5. However, the mechanisms utilized by NS5 from different flaviviruses are often quite different, sometimes despite close evolutionary relationships between viruses. The varied mechanisms of NS5 as an IFN-I antagonist are also surprising given that the evolution of NS5 is restrained by the requirement to maintain function of two enzymatic activities critical for virus replication, the methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This review discusses the different strategies used by flavivirus NS5 to evade the antiviral effects of IFN-I and how this information can be used to better model disease and develop antiviral countermeasures.

TI  - The Multifaceted Roles of Autophagy in Flavivirus-Host Interactions
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 19
AB  - Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process in which intracellular components are eliminated via lysosomal degradation to supply nutrients for organelle biogenesis and metabolic homeostasis. Flavivirus infections underlie multiple human diseases and thus exert an immense burden on public health worldwide. Mounting evidence indicates that host autophagy is subverted to modulate the life cycles of flaviviruses, such as hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The diverse interplay between autophagy and flavivirus infection not only regulates viral growth in host cells but also counteracts host stress responses induced by viral infection. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of autophagy in the flavivirus life cycle. We also discuss the impacts of virus-induced autophagy on the pathogeneses of flavivirus-associated diseases and the potential use of autophagy as a therapeutic target for curing flavivirus infections and related human diseases.

TI  - The Multiples Fates of the Flavivirus RNA Genome During Pathogenesis
JF  - Frontiers in Genetics
VL  - 9
AB  - The Flavivirus genus comprises many viruses (including dengue, Zika, West Nile and yellow fever viruses) which constitute important public health concerns worldwide. For several of these pathogens, neither antivirals nor vaccines are currently available. In addition to this unmet medical need, flaviviruses are of particular interest since they constitute an excellent model for the study of spatiotemporal regulation of RNA metabolism. Indeed, with no DNA intermediate or nuclear step, the flaviviral life cycle entirely relies on the cytoplasmic fate of a single RNA species, namely the genomic viral RNA (vRNA) which contains all the genetic information necessary for optimal viral replication. From a single open reading frame, the vRNA encodes a polyprotein which is processed to generate the mature viral proteins. In addition to coding for the viral polyprotein, the vRNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis and is also selectively packaged into newly assembled viral particles. Notably, vRNA translation, replication and encapsidation must be tightly coordinated in time and space via a fine-tuned equilibrium as these processes cannot occur simultaneously and hence, are mutually exclusive. As such, these dynamic processes involve several vRNA secondary and tertiary structures as well as RNA modifications. Finally, the vRNA can be detected as a foreign molecule by cytosolic sensors which trigger upon activation antiviral signaling pathways and the production of antiviral factors such as interferons and interferon-stimulated genes. However, to create an environment favorable to infection, flaviviruses have evolved mechanisms to dampen these antiviral processes, notably through the production of a specific vRNA degradation product termed subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA). In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the fates of flavivirus vRNA and how this is regulated at the molecular level to achieve an optimal replication within infected cells.

TI  - The NS 3 nonstructural protein of flaviviruses contains an RNA triphosphatase activity.
JF  - Virology
VL  - 197 1
SP  - 265
EP  - 73
AB  - The genome of flaviviruses consists of an infectious single-stranded RNA molecule which contains a type 1 cap structure at the 5'-terminus. The cap is synthesized by RNA triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase. Since flaviviruses replicate in the cytoplasm, it can be assumed that these functions are performed by virus-coded proteins. We previously showed that subtilisin treatment of membranes isolated from cells infected with the West Nile flavivirus results in release of a 50 kDa molecular weight fragment of the viral nonstructural protein NS 3. This so-called p50-S protein contains the residue gly (168) of NS 3 at the amino-terminus and represents an RNA-stimulated NTPase. In the present report we present experimental evidence which indicates that the p50-S protein also contains the active site of an RNA triphosphatase. The activity specifically cleaves the beta,gamma-triphosphate bond at the 5'-terminus of RNA. The localization of NS 3 protein sequence elements with known functions indicates that this multifunctional protein contains a protease in the amino-terminal part, a helicase in the central region and the RNA triphosphatase in the carboxy-terminal domain. An amino acid sequence element which may be involved in recognition of the 5'-terminal RNA triphosphate is tentatively identified. A homologous element may be present in the vaccinia virus-coded RNA triphosphatase.

TI  - The NS5 Protein of the Virulent West Nile Virus NY99 Strain Is a Potent Antagonist of Type I Interferon-Mediated JAK-STAT Signaling
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 3503
EP  - 3515
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses transmitted by arthropods represent a tremendous disease burden for humans, causing millions of infections annually. All vector-borne flaviviruses studied to date suppress host innate responses to infection by inhibiting alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β)-mediated JAK-STAT signal transduction. The viral nonstructural protein NS5 of some flaviviruses functions as the major IFN antagonist, associated with inhibition of IFN-dependent STAT1 phosphorylation (pY-STAT1) or with STAT2 degradation. West Nile virus (WNV) infection prevents pY-STAT1 although a role for WNV NS5 in IFN antagonism has not been fully explored. Here, we report that NS5 from the virulent NY99 strain of WNV prevented pY-STAT1 accumulation, suppressed IFN-dependent gene expression, and rescued the growth of a highly IFN-sensitive virus (Newcastle disease virus) in the presence of IFN, suggesting that this protein can function as an efficient IFN antagonist. In contrast, NS5 from Kunjin virus (KUN), a naturally attenuated subtype of WNV, was a poor suppressor of pY-STAT1. Mutation of a single residue in KUN NS5 to the analogous residue in WNV-NY99 NS5 (S653F) rendered KUN NS5 an efficient inhibitor of pY-STAT1. Incorporation of this mutation into recombinant KUN resulted in 30-fold greater inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling than with the wild-type virus and enhanced KUN replication in the presence of IFN. Thus, a naturally occurring mutation is associated with the function of NS5 in IFN antagonism and may influence virulence of WNV field isolates.

TI  - The Native Wolbachia Endosymbionts of Drosophila melanogaster and Culex quinquefasciatus Increase Host Resistance to West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 5
AB  - Background The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis has been shown to increase host resistance to viral infection in native Drosophila hosts and in the normally Wolbachia-free heterologous host Aedes aegypti when infected by Wolbachia from Drosophila melanogaster or Aedes albopictus. Wolbachia infection has not yet been demonstrated to increase viral resistance in a native Wolbachia-mosquito host system. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we investigated Wolbachia-induced resistance to West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae) by measuring infection susceptibility in Wolbachia-infected and Wolbachia-free D. melanogaster and Culex quinquefasciatus, a natural mosquito vector of WNV. Wolbachia infection of D. melanogaster induces strong resistance to WNV infection. Wolbachia-infected flies had a 500-fold higher ID50 for WNV and produced 100,000-fold lower virus titers compared to flies lacking Wolbachia. The resistance phenotype was transmitted as a maternal, cytoplasmic factor and was fully reverted in flies cured of Wolbachia. Wolbachia infection had much less effect on the susceptibility of D. melanogaster to Chikungunya (Togaviridae) and La Crosse (Bunyaviridae) viruses. Wolbachia also induces resistance to WNV infection in Cx. quinquefasciatus. While Wolbachia had no effect on the overall rate of peroral infection by WNV, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes produced lower virus titers and had 2 to 3-fold lower rates of virus transmission compared to mosquitoes lacking Wolbachia. Conclusions/Significance This is the first demonstration that Wolbachia can increase resistance to arbovirus infection resulting in decreased virus transmission in a native Wolbachia-mosquito system. The results suggest that Wolbachia reduces vector competence in Cx. quinquefasciatus, and potentially in other Wolbachia-infected mosquito vectors.

TI  - The Naturally Attenuated Kunjin Strain of West Nile Virus Shows Enhanced Sensitivity to the Host Type I Interferon Response
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 5664
EP  - 5668
AB  - ABSTRACT The host determinants that contribute to attenuation of the naturally occurring nonpathogenic strain of West Nile virus (WNV), the Kunjin strain (WNVKUN), remain unknown. Here, we show that compared to a highly pathogenic North American strain, WNVKUN exhibited an enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral effects of type I interferon. Our studies establish that the virulence of WNVKUN can be restored in cells and mice deficient in specific interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) or the common type I interferon receptor. Thus, WNVKUN is attenuated primarily through its enhanced restriction by type I interferon- and IRF-3-dependent mechanisms.

TI  - The Role of Host Cholesterol During Flavivirus Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - In recent years the emergence and resurgence of arboviruses have generated a global health alert. Among arboviruses, Dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), Yellow Fever (YFV), and West Nile (WNV) virus, belong to the genus Flavivirus, cause high viremia and occasionally fatal clinical disease in humans. Given the genetic austerity of the virus, they depend on cellular factors and organelles to complete its replication. One of the cellular components required for flavivirus infection is cholesterol. Cholesterol is an abundant lipid in biomembranes of eukaryotes cells and is necessary to maintain the cellular homeostasis. Recently, it has been reported, that cholesterol is fundamental during flavivirus infection in both mammal and insect vector models. During infection with DENV, ZIKV, YFV, and WNV the modulation of levels of host-cholesterol facilitates viral entry, replicative complexes formation, assembly, egress, and control of the interferon type I response. This modulation involves changes in cholesterol uptake with the concomitant regulation of cholesterol receptors as well as changes in cholesterol synthesis related to important modifications in cellular metabolism pathways. In view of the flavivirus dependence of cholesterol and the lack of an effective anti-flaviviral treatment, this cellular lipid has been proposed as a therapeutic target to treat infection using FDA-approved cholesterol-lowering drugs. This review aims to address the dependence of cholesterol by flaviviruses as well as the basis for anti flaviviral therapy using drugs which target is cholesterol synthesis or uptake.

In particular, those transmitted by mosquitoes present the greatest challenges to disease control efforts. An understanding of the molecular basis for mosquito innate immunity to arbovirus infection is therefore critical to investigations regarding arbovirus evolution, virus-vector ecology, and mosquito vector competence. In this review, we discuss the current state of understanding regarding mosquito innate immunity to West Nile virus. We draw from the literature with respect to other virus-vector pairings to attempt to draw inferences to gaps in our knowledge about West Nile virus and relevant vectors.

JF  - Journal of Antivirals & Antiretrovirals
VL  - 10
SP  - 86
EP  - 87
AB  - Several studies have demonstrated that overexpression of IFITMs could inhibit virus entry and infection of a variety of virus families (including orthomyxoviridae and flaviviruses) in cell culture systems [2,3]. Over-expression of IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 restricted early viral replication. On the contrary, knock-down of IFITM3 stimulated influenza A virus replication [4]. Researchers reported that IFITM3 is required for IFNα-induced anti-viral defense and restricts influenza A virus infection at viral entry and early-stage of virus life cycle. Knockdown of IFITM3 dampen 40%-70% of IFN's anti-viral effect. Thus, IFITM proteins are critical for the innate immunity to influenza A virus mediated by IFNs [5]. IFITMs have been demonstrated to suppress the replication of several flaviviruses including West Nile virus, dengue virus, hepatitis C virus and Zika virus [4]. IFITM1 and IFITM3 inhibit ZIKV infection at early stage of the viral life cycle. In addition, IFITM3 could inhibit ZIKV-induced cell death [6]. Another IFITMs superfamily member TMEM2 has been found to inhibit HBV infection by activating the Jak/STAT signaling pathway [7]. Notably, these restricted viruses were all encapsulated, containing the ssRNA genome, and were reported to enter cells by membrane fusion after endocytosis. However, some retroviruses, such as HIV-1 and Moloney leukaemia virus and Bunyaviridae, Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, are obviously not affected by IFITMs. In the past studies, IFITMs were not shown to inhibit HIV-1 infection [4]. However, recent studies have reported that IFITM2 and IFITM3 could interact with HIV-1 Env protein in viral producer cells, leading to impaired Env processing and virion incorporation [8]. Meanwhile, some evidence showed that IFITM3 could also limit Non-enveloped Reoviridae, reovirus replication, suggesting that IFITMs affected a variety of viruses, not limited to viruses with envelopes [9].

TI  - The Role of Microglia during West Nile Virus Infection of the Central Nervous System
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 8
AB  - Encephalitis resulting from viral infections is a major cause of hospitalization and death worldwide. West Nile Virus (WNV) is a substantial health concern as it is one of the leading causes of viral encephalitis in the United States today. WNV infiltrates the central nervous system (CNS), where it directly infects neurons and induces neuronal cell death, in part, via activation of caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. WNV infection also induces neuroinflammation characterized by activation of innate immune cells, including microglia and astrocytes, production of inflammatory cytokines, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and infiltration of peripheral leukocytes. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain and monitor the CNS for signs of injury or pathogens. Following infection with WNV, microglia exhibit a change in morphology consistent with activation and are associated with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Recent research has focused on deciphering the role of microglia during WNV encephalitis. Microglia play a protective role during infections by limiting viral growth and reducing mortality in mice. However, it also appears that activated microglia are triggered by T cells to mediate synaptic elimination at late times during infection, which may contribute to long-term neurological deficits following a neuroinvasive WNV infection. This review will discuss the important role of microglia in the pathogenesis of a neuroinvasive WNV infection. Knowledge of the precise role of microglia during a WNV infection may lead to a greater ability to treat and manage WNV encephalitis.

OPN also has significant roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune, allergy and inflammatory diseases, as well as bacterial, fungal and viral infections. West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus, is the leading agent for viral encephalitis in North America. Recent progress has been made in understanding both the biological functions of OPN and the pathogenesis of WNV. In this review article, we have summarized the current understanding of the biology of OPN and its vital roles in the pathogenesis of WNV encephalitis.

TI  - The Src Family Kinase c-Yes Is Required for Maturation of West Nile Virus Particles
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 11943
EP  - 11951
AB  - ABSTRACT The role of cellular genes in West Nile virus (WNV) replication is not well understood. Examination of cellular transcripts upregulated during WNV infection revealed an increase in the expression of the src family kinase (SFK) c-Yes. WNV-infected cell lines treated with the SFK inhibitor PP2 demonstrated a 2- to 4-log decrease in viral titers, suggesting that SFK activity is required for completion of the viral replication cycle. RNA interference mediated knock-down of c-Yes, but not c-Src, and similarly reduced virus yield, specifically implicating c-Yes in WNV production. Interestingly, PP2 treatment did not reduce intracellular levels of either viral RNA or protein, suggesting that the drug does not act on the early stages of replication. However, endoglycosidase H (endoH) digestion of the viral envelope (E) glycoprotein revealed that the acquisition of endoH-resistant glycans by E, but not endogenous major histocompatibility complex class I, was reduced in PP2-treated cells, demonstrating that E specifically does not traffic beyond the endoplasmic reticulum in the absence of SFK activity. Electron microscopy further revealed that PP2-treated WNV-infected cells accumulated an increased number of virions in the ER compared to untreated cells. Therefore, we conclude that inhibition of SFK activity did not interfere with virus assembly but prevented transit of virions through the secretory pathway. These results identify c-Yes as a cellular protein that is involved in WNV assembly and egress.

JF  - Science
VL  - 344
SP  - 307
EP  - 310
AB  - Resisting the Chop Dengue, West Nile, and Yellow Fever viruses are all flaviviruses that have single-stranded RNA genomes and form specific, short flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) during infection that cause viral pathogenicity. These sfRNAs are produced by the incomplete degradation of viral RNA by the host-cell exonuclease Xrn1. What stops the host enzyme from completely chopping up the viral RNA? Chapman et al. (p. 307) reveal a pseudoknot in the structure of the Xrn1-resistant segment of a sfRNA from Murray Valley Encephalitis Virus, which, perhaps, the host Xrn1 exonuclease cannot untangle. A pseudoknot in a flavivirus RNA resists efforts by a host nuclease to untangle it. Flaviviruses are emerging human pathogens and worldwide health threats. During infection, pathogenic subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) are produced by resisting degradation by the 5′→3′ host cell exonuclease Xrn1 through an unknown RNA structure-based mechanism. Here, we present the crystal structure of a complete Xrn1-resistant flaviviral RNA, which contains interwoven pseudoknots within a compact structure that depends on highly conserved nucleotides. The RNA’s three-dimensional topology creates a ringlike conformation, with the 5′ end of the resistant structure passing through the ring from one side of the fold to the other. Disruption of this structure prevents formation of sfRNA during flaviviral infection. Thus, sfRNA formation results from an RNA fold that interacts directly with Xrn1, presenting the enzyme with a structure that confounds its helicase activity.

TI  - The TAM receptor Mertk protects against neuroinvasive viral infection by maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity
JF  - Nature medicine
VL  - 21
SP  - 1464
EP  - 1472
AB  - The TAM receptors Tyro3, Axl and Mertk are receptor tyrosine kinases that dampen host innate immune responses following engagement with their ligands Gas6 and Protein S, which recognize phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. In a form of apoptotic mimicry, many enveloped viruses display phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of their membranes, enabling TAM receptor activation and downregulation of antiviral responses. Accordingly, we hypothesized that a deficiency of TAM receptors would enhance antiviral responses and protect against viral infection. Unexpectedly, mice lacking Mertk and/or Axl, but not Tyro3, exhibited greater vulnerability to infection with neuroinvasive West Nile and La Crosse encephalitis viruses. This phenotype was associated with increased blood-brain barrier permeability, which enhanced virus entry into and infection of the brain. Activation of Mertk synergized with interferon-β to tighten cell junctions and prevent virus transit across brain microvascular endothelial cells. Because TAM receptors restrict pathogenesis of neuroinvasive viruses, these findings have implications for TAM antagonists that are currently in clinical development.

TI  - The Topology of Bulges in the Long Stem of the Flavivirus 3′ Stem-Loop Is a Major Determinant of RNA Replication Competence
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 2309
EP  - 2324
AB  - ABSTRACT All flavivirus genomes contain a 3′terminal stem-loop secondary structure (3′SL) formed by the most downstream ∼100 nucleotides (nt) of the viral RNA. The 3′SL is required for virus replication and has been shown to bind both virus-coded and cellular proteins. Results of the present study using an infectious DNA for WN virus strain 956 initially demonstrated that the dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN2) 3′SL nucleotide sequence could not substitute for that of the WN 3′SL to support WN genome replication. To determine what WN virus-specific 3′SL nucleotide sequences were required for WN virus replication, WN virus 3′SL nucleotide sequences were selectively deleted and replaced by analogous segments of the DEN2 3′SL nucleotide sequence such that the overall 3′SL secondary structure was not disrupted. Top and bottom portions of the WN virus 3′SL were defined according to previous studies (J. L. Blackwell and M. A. Brinton, J. Virol. 71:6433-6444, 1997; L. Zeng, L., B. Falgout, and L. Markoff, J. Virol. 72:7510-7522, 1998). A bulge in the top portion of the long stem of the WN 3′SL was essential for replication of mutant WN RNAs, and replication-defective RNAs failed to produce negative strands in transfected cells. Introduction of a second bulge into the bottom portion of the long stem of the wild-type WN 3′SL markedly enhanced the replication competence of WN virus in mosquito cells but had no effect on replication in mammalian cells. This second bulge was identified as a host cell-specific enhancer of flavivirus replication. Results suggested that bulges and their topological location within the long stem of the 3′SL are primary determinants of replication competence for flavivirus genomes.

TI  - The Two-component NS2B-NS3 Proteinase Represses DNA Unwinding Activity of the West Nile Virus NS3 Helicase*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 283
SP  - 17270
EP  - 17278
AB  - Similar to many flavivirus types including Dengue and yellow fever viruses, the nonstructural NS3 multifunctional protein of West Nile virus (WNV) with an N-terminal serine proteinase domain and an RNA triphosphatase, an NTPase domain, and an RNA helicase in the C-terminal domain is implicated in both polyprotein processing and RNA replication and is therefore a promising drug target. To exhibit its proteolytic activity, NS3 proteinase requires the presence of the cofactor encoded by the upstream NS2B sequence. During our detailed investigation of the biology of the WNV helicase, we characterized the ATPase and RNA/DNA unwinding activities of the full-length NS2B-NS3 proteinase-helicase protein as well as the individual NS3 helicase domain lacking both the NS2B cofactor and the NS3 proteinase sequence and the individual NS3 proteinase-helicase lacking only the NS2B cofactor. We determined that both the NS3 helicase and NS3 proteinase-helicase constructs are capable of unwinding both the DNA and the RNA templates. In contrast, the full-length NS2B-NS3 proteinase-helicase unwinds only the RNA templates, whereas its DNA unwinding activity is severely repressed. Our data suggest that the productive, catalytically competent fold of the NS2B-NS3 proteinase moiety represents an essential component of the RNA-DNA substrate selectivity mechanism in WNV and, possibly, in other flaviviruses. Based on our data, we hypothesize that the mechanism we have identified plays a role yet to be determined in WNV replication occurring both within the virus-induced membrane-bound replication complexes in the host cytoplasm and in the nuclei of infected cells.

VL  - 77
SP  - 253
EP  - 266
AB  - SUMMARY The prokaryotic translation elongation factors were identified as essential cofactors for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the bacteriophage Qβ more than 40 years ago. A growing body of evidence now shows that eukaryotic translation elongation factors (eEFs), predominantly eEF1A, acting in partially characterized complexes sometimes involving additional eEFs, facilitate virus replication. The functions of eEF1A as a protein chaperone and an RNA- and actin-binding protein enable its “moonlighting” roles as a virus replication cofactor. A diverse group of viruses, from human immunodeficiency type 1 and West Nile virus to tomato bushy stunt virus, have adapted to use eEFs as cofactors for viral transcription, translation, assembly, and pathogenesis. Here we review the mechanisms used by viral pathogens to usurp these abundant cellular proteins for their replication.

AB  - Positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses are an important group of human and animal pathogens that have significant global health and economic impacts. Notable members include West Nile virus, Dengue virus, Chikungunya, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus and enteroviruses of the Picornaviridae family.Unfortunately, prophylactic and therapeutic treatments against these pathogens are limited. +RNA viruses have limited coding capacity and thus rely extensively on host factors for successful infection and propagation. A common feature among these viruses is their ability to dramatically modify cellular membranes to serve as platforms for genome replication and assembly of new virions. These viral replication complexes (VRCs) serve two main functions: To increase replication efficiency by concentrating critical factors and to protect the viral genome from host anti-viral systems. This review summarizes current knowledge of critical host factors recruited to or demonstrated to be involved in the biogenesis and stabilization of +RNA virus VRCs.

TI  - The West Nile Virus Capsid Protein Blocks Apoptosis through a Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase-Dependent Mechanism
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 872
EP  - 881
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted pathogen that can cause serious disease in humans. Our laboratories are focused on understanding how interactions between WNV proteins and host cells contribute to virus replication and pathogenesis. WNV replication is relatively slow, and on the basis of earlier studies, the virus appears to activate survival pathways that delay host cell death during virus replication. The WNV capsid is the first viral protein produced in infected cells; however, its role in virus assembly is not required until after replication of the genomic RNA. Accordingly, from a temporal perspective, it is perfectly suited to block host cell apoptosis during virus replication. In the present study, we provide evidence that the WNV capsid protein blocks apoptosis through a phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-dependent pathway. Specifically, expression of this protein in the absence of other viral proteins increases the levels of phosphorylated Akt, a prosurvival kinase that blocks apoptosis through multiple mechanisms. Treatment of cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 abrogates the protective effects of the WNV capsid protein.

JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 121
AB  - Significance Our work reveals that the West Nile virus (WNV) RNA genome folds with minimal host dependence. We show that a specific genome conformation dominates in cells and propose replication complex formation as a “molecular switch” for transition between life cycle phases. We describe a domain architecture of the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) that provides mechanistic insights into subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) production. We identify six riboregulatory elements that play host-specific functional roles. We show that structural homology is an indicator of functional RNA structure, a method extendable to other enzootic viruses. We show that antisense locked nucleic acids (ASO LNAs) can induce potent defects in WNV growth, representing an exciting development in nucleic acid therapeutics.

TI  - The critical role of interleukin-6 in protection against neurotropic flavivirus infection
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are emerging mosquito-borne flaviviruses causing encephalitis globally. No specific drug or therapy exists to treat flavivirus-induced neurological diseases. The lack of specific therapeutics underscores an urgent need to determine the function of important host factors involved in flavivirus replication and disease progression. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) upregulation has been observed during viral infections in both mice and humans, implying that it may influence the disease outcome significantly. Herein, we investigated the function of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of neurotropic flavivirus infections. First, we examined the role of IL-6 in flavivirus-infected human neuroblastoma cells, SK-N-SH, and found that IL-6 neutralization increased the WNV or JEV replication and inhibited the expression of key cytokines. We further evaluated the role of IL-6 by infecting primary mouse cells derived from IL-6 knockout (IL-6−/−) mice and wild-type (WT) mice with WNV or JEV. The results exhibited increased virus yields in the cells lacking the IL-6 gene. Next, our in vivo approach revealed that IL-6−/− mice had significantly higher morbidity and mortality after subcutaneous infection with the pathogenic WNV NY99 or JEV Nakayama strain compared to WT mice. The non-pathogenic WNV Eg101 strain did not cause mortality in WT mice but resulted in 60% mortality in IL-6−/− mice, indicating that IL-6 is required for the survival of mice after the peripheral inoculation of WNV or JEV. We also observed significantly higher viremia and brain viral load in IL-6−/− mice than in WT mice. Subsequently, we explored innate immune responses in WT and IL-6−/− mice after WNV NY99 infection. Our data demonstrated that the IL-6−/− mice had reduced levels of key cytokines in the serum during early infection but elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain later, along with suppressed anti-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, mRNA expression of IFN-α and IFN-β was significantly lower in the infected IL-6−/− mice. In conclusion, these data suggest that the lack of IL-6 exacerbates WNV or JEV infection in vitro and in vivo by causing an increase in virus replication and dysregulating host immune response.

AB  - The interaction between the flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV) and cells of the mouse macrophage-like cell line, P388D1, was assayed by transmission electron microscopy, by following the association of [35S]methionine-labelled virus with cells, and by using a radiobinding assay with an 125I-labelled F(ab')2 fragment of a monoclonal antibody directed against the major viral envelope surface glycoprotein. Using electron microscopy, both fusion and endocytosis were observed at pH 6.4, but at pH 8.0 only endocytosis was observed. When 35S-labelled WNV was bound to the P388D1 cell surface at 0 degrees C, less virus eluted on warming to 37 degrees C at mildly acidic than at alkaline or neutral pH values. The monoclonal antibody fragment had an increased affinity for cell surface viral E glycoprotein after prebound WNV was warmed at mildly acidic pH values. It is proposed that the warming of cell-virus mixtures at low pH results in fusion with a consequent reduction in elution of virus and an increase in the recognition of cell surface-expressed viral envelope glycoprotein by labelled antibody.

TI  - The entanglement between flaviviruses and ER-shaping proteins
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a continuous intracellular membrane system that composes the nuclear envelope and radiates out to the peripheries of the cell, transitioning from ribosome-studded, flat cisternal sheets to highly curved reticulated tubules. It has been implicated in a diverse array of cellular functions, including production, trafficking, and degradation of proteins; synthesis and distribution of lipids and steroids; calcium sequestration and release; cell signaling and innate immunity; carbohydrate metabolism; and detoxification of harmful substances [1]. Such a ubiquitous and functionally versatile organelle is parasitized by viruses in order to facilitate their life cycle. Rotavirus, vaccinia virus (VV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as members of the Flavivirus genus—dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV)—are all intimately associated with the ER [2]. The flaviviruses replicate on the ER membranes and form immature viral particles that bud into the ER lumen. These particles are then trafficked through the ER–Golgi network and undergo a maturation process brought about by pH alteration and cleavage by the hostprotease Furin. This viral takeover of the ER requires the co-opting of cellular proteins as well as the active remodeling of the ER membrane to create a cellular environment more conducive to replication [3]. Several ER proteins have been identified as host factors in flavivirus replication [4], but a class of resident proteins that shape and maintain the dynamic ER architecture are of particular interest. These “ER-shaping” proteins could potentially serve as host factors that support viral replication or restriction factors that protect the ER. Interactome and CRISPR screens have produced somewhat discordant results, but the less stringent screens suggest that ER-shaping proteins may be targets of viral proteins [5] [6] [7]. This Pearl review will explore the virus-induced ER-membrane rearrangement and the relationship between ER-shaping proteins and the flavivirus life cycle.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 84 Pt 2
SP  - 429
EP  - 40
AB  - The family Flaviviridae includes important human pathogens, such as dengue (DEN) virus, yellow fever (YF) virus and hepatitis C virus, many of which have emerged or re-emerged in recent years. Until recently, flavivirus evolution was thought to proceed in a clonal manner, with diversity generated mainly through the accumulation of mutational changes. However, this assumption has now been shown to be invalid, with homologous recombination demonstrated in all three genera of the FLAVIVIRIDAE: Since recombination has important implications for the study of virus evolution, a survey of recombination in the viruses of the genus Flavivirus was carried out. Using envelope gene sequence data and a combination of graphical and phylogenetic analyses, hitherto unreported recombination in Japanese encephalitis virus and St Louis encephalitis virus was detected, as well as further recombinants in DEN virus. However, no evidence for recombination was found in West Nile or YF viruses, or in the tick-borne flavivirus group. It is proposed that the difference between the mosquito- and tick-borne viruses can be accounted for by their differing modes of transmission, whilst the variation among the mosquito-borne flaviviruses reflects both the ecology of the particular host and vector species and also bias in the sampling process.

TI  - The flavivirus NS1 protein's mysteries unveiled?
JF  - BioEssays
VL  - 37
AB  - Flaviviruses encompass major human pathogens including dengue virus (DENV), responsible for the most devastating hemorrhagic feverworldwide, and West Nile virus (WNV), a growing cause of encephalitis in human populations. These small enveloped RNA viruses, transmitted to their vertebrate hosts by a mosquito vector, encode a fascinating accessory protein of 50 kDa, NS1, which remodels cell membranes, orchestrates virus replication in dedicated intracellular organelles and colonizes the extracellular space with a myriad of small lipid-loaded “spaceships” launched against the host biological and immunological barriers [1–3]. In an attempt to specify NS1 function(s) and the related molecular determinants, several laboratories around the world have tackled the challenge of crystallizing NS1 for many years. The recent success in solving the three-dimensional structure of the DENV NS1 and WNV NS1 raises hopes that this versatile protein will unveil some of its mysteries at last [4, 5], as discussed in the review from Akey et al. in this issue [6]. The first striking observation is that the folds of the DENV NS1 and WNV NS1 look alike, suggesting that the major functionalities of the protein have been maintained during virus evolution. In effect, the maturation process of all flavivirus NS1 proteins is remarkably similar. NS1 is known to assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as stable homodimers that acquire the ability to interact with membranes and remain associated to the cell during viral infection [2]. Alternatively, trimers of NS1 dimers pinch off membranes and carry away proximal lipids in such a way that

MVE and West Nile virus-immune, H-2k-restricted, effector cells recognized peptides derived from the MVE nonstructural polyprotein segment, and in this region the immunodominant determinant mapped to protein NS3. Interestingly, mapping of cytotoxic T cell antigenic determinants of other flaviviruses also identified the NS3 protein as the dominant source of antigenic peptides (A. B. Hill, A. Müllbacher, C. Parrish, G. Coia, E. G. Westaway, and R. V. Blanden, 1992, J. Gen. Virol. 73, 1115-1123; A. L. Rothman, I. Kurane, C.-J. Lai, M. Bray, B. Falgout, R. Men, and F. A. Ennis, 1993, J. Virol. 67, 801-806). Using an allele-specific peptide motiff for H-2Kk, we predicted 12 peptides in the MVE NS3 protein as ligands for the restriction element and identified three peptides which were recognized in association with H-2Kk by MVE-immune cytotoxic T cells. We also examined the effect of proteolytic processing in the MVE nonstructural polyprotein segment mediated by the viral proteinase NS3 on antigen processing and presentation of the MVE H-2Kk-restricted T cell determinant. Processing of the MVE polyprotein by the viral proteinase did not markedly influence the availability of this peptide determinant.

AB  - The complete genome of West Nile (Sarafend) virus [WN(S)V] was sequenced. Phylogenetic trees utilizing the complete genomic sequence, capsid gene, envelope gene and NS5 gene/3' untranslated region of WN(S)V classified WN(S)V as a lineage II virus. A full-length infectious clone of WN(S)V with a point mutation in the glycosylation site of the envelope protein (pWNS-S154A) was constructed. Both growth kinetics and the mode of maturation were affected by this mutation. The titre of the pWNS-S154A virus was lower than the wild-type virus. This defect was corrected by the expression of wild-type envelope protein in trans. The pWNS-S154A virus matured intracellularly instead of at the plasma membrane as shown for the parental WN(S)V.

AB  - West Nile encephalitis virus (WNV) is a small, enveloped, mosquito-transmitted, positive-polarity RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family. This virus is closely related to other arthropod-borne viruses that cause human disease including Dengue, Yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. WNV cycles in nature between mosquitoes and birds, but also infects human, horses, and other vertebrates. In humans, WNV disseminates to the central nervous system (CNS) and causes severe disease primarily in the immunocompromised and elderly. Experimental studies have made significant progress in dissecting the viral and host factors that determine the pathogenesis and outcome of WNV infection. This review will focus on the interactions between WNV and the protective and pathogenic host immune responses.

TI  - The membrane proteins of flaviviruses form ion-permeable pores in the target membrane after fusion: identification of the pores and analysis of their possible role in virus infection.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 84 Pt 7
SP  - 1711
EP  - 21
AB  - Recently, we presented evidence that the E1 fusion protein of the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus forms ion-permeable pores in the target membrane after fusion. We proposed that the homologous fusion proteins of flaviviruses and hepatitis C virus form similar pores. To test this hypothesis for the E fusion protein of flaviviruses, the release of [(3)H]choline from liposomes by the flavivirus West Nile (WN) virus was determined. [(3)H]Choline was released at mildly acid pH. The pH threshold depended on the lipid composition. Release from certain liposomes was activated even at neutral pH. To identify the generation of individual pores, single cells were investigated with the patch-clamp technique. The formation of individual pores during low pH-induced WN virus entry at the plasma membrane occurred within seconds. These experiments were performed in parallel with Semliki Forest virus. The results indicated that, similar to alphavirus infection, infection with flaviviruses via endosomes leads to the formation of ion-permeable pores in the endosome after fusion, which allows the flow of protons from the endosome into the cytoplasm during virus entry. However, in vitro translation experiments of viral cores showed that, in contrast to alphaviruses, which probably need this proton flow for core disassembly, the genome RNA of WN virus present in the viral core is directly accessible for translation. For entry of flaviviruses, therefore, a second pathway for productive infection may exist, in which fusion of the viral membrane is activated at neutral pH by contact with a plasma membrane of appropriate lipid composition.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that primarily infects birds but occasionally also infects humans and horses. In recent years, the frequency of WNV outbreaks in humans has increased, and these outbreaks have been associated with a higher incidence of severe disease. In 1999, the geographical distribution of WNV expanded to the Western hemisphere. WNV has a positive strand RNA genome of about 11 kb that encodes a single polyprotein. WNV replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Although there are still many questions to be answered, a large body of data on the molecular biology of WNV and other flaviviruses has already been obtained. Aspects of virion structure, the viral replication cycle, viral protein function, genome structure, conserved viral elements, host factors, virus-host interactions, and vaccines are discussed in this review.

TI  - The olfactory nerve: a shortcut for influenza and other viral diseases into the central nervous system
JF  - The Journal of Pathology
VL  - 235
AB  - The olfactory nerve consists mainly of olfactory receptor neurons and directly connects the nasal cavity with the central nervous system (CNS). Each olfactory receptor neuron projects a dendrite into the nasal cavity on the apical side, and on the basal side extends its axon through the cribriform plate into the olfactory bulb of the brain. Viruses that can use the olfactory nerve as a shortcut into the CNS include influenza A virus, herpesviruses, poliovirus, paramyxoviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus, rabies virus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, La Crosse virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and bunyaviruses. However, mechanisms of transport via the olfactory nerve and subsequent spread through the CNS are poorly understood. Proposed mechanisms are either infection of olfactory receptor neurons themselves or diffusion through channels formed by olfactory ensheathing cells. Subsequent virus spread through the CNS could occur by multiple mechanisms, including trans‐synaptic transport and microfusion. Viral infection of the CNS can lead to damage from infection of nerve cells per se, from the immune response, or from a combination of both. Clinical consequences range from nervous dysfunction in the absence of histopathological changes to severe meningoencephalitis and neurodegenerative disease.

TI  - The secretory fate of flavivirus NS1 in mosquito cells is influenced by the caveolin binding domain
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Flaviviruses of major medical importance worldwide such as dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and yellow fever (YFV) viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes Aedes sp. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of these flaviviruses is secreted from the infected cells using different secretion routes depending on the cell and virus nature. The NS1 of DENV and ZIKV contain in the hydrophobic region a conserved caveolin binding domain (CBD) (ΦXXΦXXXXΦ), which is not conserved in YFV NS1. To ascertain the role of the CBD in the secretory route followed by flavivirus NS1, expression vectors for the NS1 of DENV2, ZIKV and YFV were constructed. Using site-directed mutagenesis, substitutions were made in the aromatic residues within CBD; in addition, the full domain was replaced by those of other flaviviruses, creating chimeras in the CBD of NS1. Substitutions of the aromatic residues to Ala or Thr, or CBD chimeras, results in increased sensitivity of NS1 secretion to brefeldin A treatment, indicating a change to a classical secretion pathway. Likewise, the insertion of the DENV/ZIKV CBD into the recombinant Gaussia-Luciferase results in a loss of sensitivity to BFA treatment, in luciferase secretion. These results suggest that the CBD sequence is a molecular determinant for the unconventional secretory route followed by DENV and ZIKV NS1 in mosquito cells. However, the cellular components that recognize the CBD in the NS1 of DENV and ZIKV and redirect them to an unconventional route and if this secretion route confers unique functions to NS1 within the vector mosquito are aspects currently unknown. Importance Flaviviruses are an important cause of mosquito borne diseases to humans. We have previously demonstrated that the non-structural protein 1 from dengue and zika virus are secreted efficiently from mosquito cells using an unconventional route, that depends on caveolin and molecular chaperones. In this work, we show evidence indicating that a caveolin binding domain, well conserved and exposed in dengue and Zika virus NS1, but absent in other flaviviruses such as yellow fever virus or West Nile virus, is important in determining the unconventional secretion pathway followed by dengue and zika virus NS1 in mosquito cells. The unique secretory pathway followed by NS1 in mosquito cells may result in distinctive viral-cellular protein associations required to facilitate viral infection in the mosquito vector. To identify viral and cellular elements that could disturb the traffic of dengue and Zika virus NS1 may be important to design of strategies for vector control.

SP  - 1941
EP  - 50
AB  - Infectivity of the West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae) was inactivated on exposure for brief periods (90 s) to pH 6.6 and below. This inactivation was not due to decreased interaction between cells and acid-treated virus. The RNA of [3H]uridine-labelled virus particles prebound to the cell surface before acidic pH treatment underwent rapid uncoating within 1 min at 37 degrees C at the same pH values that inactivated virus particles. The uncoating of [3H]uridine-labelled virus particles was also studied over longer time periods after synchronized internalization by P388D1 cells. At pH 7.6 uncoating occurred rapidly after a reproducible time lag of 1 min on warming to 37 degrees C and was essentially complete by 15 to 30 min after the start of internalization, leaving uncoated RNA in an infectious form. In contrast, at pH 6.2 viral uncoating occurred rapidly without any time lag and the uncoated RNA appeared to be far less infectious than that uncoated at pH 7.6. Ammonium chloride could almost totally inhibit both the infectivity and uncoating of virus particles on synchronized internalization into P388D1 cells, with a pH optimum of 8.0. These results suggest that the uncoating of virus particles is dependent on an acidic pH, although the location of uncoating (prelysosomal endosome or plasma membrane) decides whether the uncoated RNA will be infectious or not. Essentially the same results were obtained when infections were carried out in the presence of enhancing antibody.

AB  - The Flavivirus genus includes widespread and severe human pathogens like the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1 to DENV4), yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. Domain III (ED3) of the viral envelope protein interacts with cell receptors and contains epitopes recognized by virus neutralizing antibodies. Its structural, antigenic and immunogenic properties have been thoroughly studied contrary to its physico-chemical properties. Here, the ED3 domains of the above pathogenic flaviviruses were produced in the periplasm of Escherichia coli. Their thermodynamic stabilities were measured and compared in experiments of unfolding equilibriums, induced with chemicals or heat and monitored through protein fluorescence. A designed ED3 domain, with the consensus sequence of DENV strains from all serotypes, was highly stable. The low stability of the ED3 domain from DENV3 was increased by three changes of residues in the protein core without affecting its reactivity towards DENV-infected human serums. Additional changes showed that the stability of ED3 varied with the DENV3 genotype. The T(m) of ED3 was higher than 69°C for all the tested viruses and reached 86°C for the consensus ED3. The latter, deprived of its disulfide bond by mutations, was predominantly unfolded at 20°C. These results will help better understand and design the properties of ED3 for its use as diagnostic, vaccine or therapeutic tools.

JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 49

EP  - 7138
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFVs) including dengue, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses have an RNA genome encoding one open reading frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). The 3′ UTRs of MBFVs contain regions of high sequence conservation in structured RNA elements known as dumbbells (DBs) that regulate translation and replication of the viral RNA genome, functions proposed to depend on the formation of an RNA pseudoknot. To understand how DB structure provides this function, we used x-ray crystallography and structural modeling to reveal the details of its three-dimensional fold. The structure confirmed the predicted pseudoknot and molecular modeling revealed how conserved sequences form a four-way junction that appears to stabilize the pseudoknot. Single-molecule FRET suggests that the DB pseudoknot is a stable element that can regulate the switch between translation and replication during the viral lifecycle by modulating long-range RNA conformational changes.

TI  - Toll-Like Receptor 3 Has a Protective Role against West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 10349
EP  - 10358
AB  - ABSTRACT Protection against West Nile virus (WNV) infection requires rapid viral sensing and the generation of an interferon (IFN) response. Mice lacking IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) show increased vulnerability to WNV infection with enhanced viral replication and blunted IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) responses. IRF-3 functions downstream of several viral sensors, including Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), RIG-I, and MDA5. Cell culture studies suggest that host recognizes WNV in part, through the cytoplasmic helicase RIG-I and to a lesser extent, MDA5, both of which activate ISG expression through IRF-3. However, the role of TLR3 in vivo in recognizing viral RNA and activating antiviral defense pathways has remained controversial. We show here that an absence of TLR3 enhances WNV mortality in mice and increases viral burden in the brain. Compared to congenic wild-type controls, TLR3−/− mice showed relatively modest changes in peripheral viral loads. Consistent with this, little difference in multistep viral growth kinetics or IFN-α/β induction was observed between wild-type and TLR3−/− fibroblasts, macrophages, and dendritic cells. In contrast, a deficiency of TLR3 was associated with enhanced viral replication in primary cortical neuron cultures and greater WNV infection in central nervous system neurons after intracranial inoculation. Taken together, our data suggest that TLR3 serves a protective role against WNV in part, by restricting replication in neurons.

TI  - Toll-Like Receptor-3 Is Dispensable for the Innate MicroRNA Response to West Nile Virus (WNV)
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - The innate immune response to West Nile virus (WNV) infection involves recognition through toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), leading to establishment of an antiviral state. MiRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be reliable biomarkers of TLR activation. Here, we sought to evaluate the contribution of TLR3 and miRNAs to the host response to WNV infection. We first analyzed HEK293-NULL and HEK293-TLR3 cells for changes in the innate immune response to infection. The presence of TLR3 did not seem to affect WNV load, infectivity or phosphorylation of IRF3. Analysis of experimentally validated NFκB-responsive genes revealed a WNV-induced signature largely independent of TLR3. Since miRNAs are involved in viral pathogenesis and the innate response to infection, we sought to identify changes in miRNA expression upon infection in the presence or absence of TLR3. MiRNA profiling revealed 70 miRNAs induced following WNV infection in a TLR3-independent manner. Further analysis of predicted gene targets of WNV signature miRNAs revealed genes highly associated with pathways regulating cell death, viral pathogenesis and immune cell trafficking.

TI  - Toll-like receptor 7-induced immune response to cutaneous West Nile virus infection.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 90 Pt 11
SP  - 2660
EP  - 8
AB  - The Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 response represents a vital host-defence mechanism in a murine model of systemic West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Here, we investigated the role of the TLR7-induced immune response following cutaneous WNV infection. We found that there was no difference in susceptibility to WNV encephalitis between wild-type and TLR7(-/-) mice upon intradermal injection or infected mosquito feeding. Viral load analysis revealed similar levels of WNV RNA in the peripheral tissues and brains of these two groups of mice following intradermal infection. There was a higher level of cytokines in the blood of wild-type mice at early stages of infection; however, this difference was diminished in the blood and brains at later stages. Langerhans cells (LCs) are permissive to WNV infection and migrate from the skin to draining lymph nodes upon intradermal challenge. Our data showed that WNV infection of TLR7(-/-) keratinocytes was significantly higher than that of wild-type keratinocytes. Infection of wild-type keratinocytes induced higher levels of alpha interferon and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6 and IL-12, which might promote LC migration from the skin. Co-culture of naïve LCs of wild-type mice with WNV-infected wild-type keratinocytes resulted in the production of more IL-6 and IL-12 than with TLR7(-/-) keratinocytes or by cultured LCs alone. Moreover, LCs in the epidermis were reduced in wild-type mice, but not in TLR7(-/-) mice, following intradermal WNV infection. Overall, our results suggest that the TLR7 response following cutaneous infection promotes LC migration from the skin, which might compromise its protective effect in systemic infection.

TI  - Towards a Universal Translator: Decoding the PTMs That Regulate Orthoflavivirus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 17
AB  - Post-translational modifications (PTMs) serve as critical regulators of protein function across biological systems, including during viral infection. For orthoflaviviruses, including human pathogens like dengue, Zika, and West Nile viruses, PTMs on viral proteins regulate multiple aspects of the viral lifecycle and pathogenesis. Here, we review the mechanisms by which PTMs regulate orthoflavivirus infection in both vertebrate and arthropod hosts. We examine how ubiquitination and glycosylation on the viral envelope proteins facilitate viral entry and how phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and acetylation on non-structural proteins modulate viral RNA replication. Additionally, we describe how PTMs on viral structural proteins dynamically regulate viral assembly and egress. We also describe how PTMs can influence tissue tropism and host-specific pathogenesis, with some modifications showing divergent functions between arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts, and how the host antiviral response can trigger specific PTMs on viral proteins to restrict infection, highlighting PTMs as key mediators of host-pathogen interactions. While significant progress has been made in identifying PTMs on viral proteins, many questions remain about their temporal dynamics, mechanisms of action, and conservation across the orthoflavivirus genus. Understanding how PTMs regulate orthoflavivirus infection may reveal new therapeutic strategies, particularly given recent advances in targeting specific protein modifications for disease treatment.

TI  - Trafficking mechanism of west Nile (Sarafend) virus structural proteins
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 67
AB  - Previous studies have shown that West Nile (Sarafend) virus matured by budding at the plasma membrane, which differs from the usual intracellular maturation of other flaviviruses. The present study investigated the trafficking mechanism of the envelope (E) and capsid (C) proteins of West Nile (Sarafend) virus during the replication cycle. The use of time‐based double‐immunofluorescence labelling coupled with the Triton X‐100 extraction procedure revealed that both the E and C proteins were transported from the perinuclear region towards the plasma membrane along the microtubules simultaneously. The strong association of these virus proteins with the microtubules was demonstrated further with Triton X‐100 extraction procedure coupled with double immunogold‐labelling. Extraction of infected cells with Triton X‐100 in high salt also revealed that virus E proteins were associated with the microtubules via protein‐protein interaction. The disruption of microtubules with vinblastine sulphate inhibited the trafficking of both the virus E and C proteins. Both virus structural proteins were observed to co‐localise and retained within vinblastine sulphate‐induced microtubulin paracrystals. Extracellular virus production was also reduced drastically by vinblastine sulphate at non‐cytotoxic concentration. Subsequent studies revealed that the transportation of virus E protein was associated with the microtubules‐based motor protein, kinesin. J. Med. Virol. 67:127–136, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 184 8
SP  - 947
EP  - 54
AB  - Infection by the flavivirus West Nile (WNV) is associated with a virus-specific increase of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules on the cell surface of diploid vertebrate cells. The increased MHC-I cell surface expression is functional and is associated with increased susceptibility to secondary WNV-immune and alloimmune cytotoxic T cells. WNV-induced up-regulation of cell surface MHC-I expression is associated with NF-kappaB activation and increased transcription of MHC-I mRNA. WNV infection increases luciferase activity of RAWa4 long terminal repeat (LTR) cells, which are transfected stably with a plasmid containing 2 NF-kappaB binding sites, the human immunodeficiency virus LTR linked to a luciferase reporter gene. The NF-kappaB-induced complexes are a p50/p65 heterodimer and another faster migrating species containing p50 homodimers. WNV-induced activation of NF-kappaB and the up-regulation of MHC-I were blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 and salicylate, both of which block phosphorylation of inhibitor kappaB.

TI  - Transcriptome Analysis of an Aedes albopictus Cell Line Single- and Dual-Infected with Lammi Virus and WNV
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 23
AB  - Understanding the flavivirus infection process in mosquito hosts is important and fundamental in the search for novel control strategies that target the mosquitoes’ ability to carry and transmit pathogenic arboviruses. A group of viruses known as insect-specific viruses (ISVs) has been shown to interfere with the infection and replication of a secondary arbovirus infection in mosquitoes and mosquito-derived cell lines. However, the molecular mechanisms behind this interference are unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we infected the Aedes albopictus cell line U4.4 with either the West Nile virus (WNV), the insect-specific Lammi virus (LamV) or an infection scheme whereby cells were pre-infected with LamV 24 h prior to WNV challenge. The qPCR analysis showed that the dual-infected U4.4 cells had a reduced number of WNV RNA copies compared to WNV-only infected cells. The transcriptome profiles of the different infection groups showed a variety of genes with altered expression. WNV-infected cells had an up-regulation of a broad range of immune-related genes, while in LamV-infected cells, many genes related to stress, such as different heat-shock proteins, were up-regulated. The transcriptome profile of the dual-infected cells was a mix of up- and down-regulated genes triggered by both viruses. Furthermore, we observed an up-regulation of signal peptidase complex (SPC) proteins in all infection groups. These SPC proteins have shown importance for flavivirus assembly and secretion and could be potential targets for gene modification in strategies for the interruption of flavivirus transmission by mosquitoes.

TI  - Transcriptome Changes in Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) Salivary Glands During West Nile Virus Infection
VL  - 47
SP  - 421
EP  - 435
AB  - ABSTRACT 
 Persistent West Nile virus (WNV) infection in the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) is associated with pathological changes in the salivary glands, including apoptotic cell death and a corresponding reduction in virus transmission over time. The vector host response to WNV infection and the molecular basis of WNV pathogenesis in Cx. quinquefasciatus was investigated using oligonucleotide microarrays designed to detect differences in the salivary gland transcriptome between WNV-infected mosquitoes and uninfected controls. Transcripts with increased abundance in infected salivary glands included those related to immunity, transcription, protein transport and degradation, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, signal transduction, and cellular detoxification. Microarray-based analysis detected a decrease in transcript levels of a Culex inhibitor of apoptosis gene (IAP-1) and a decrease in abundance of 11 transcripts encoding salivary gland proteins, Transcript levels for an endonuclease, a proline-rich mucin, and several D7 protein family members also decreased. Transcripts with the greatest change in abundance during infection had either no similarity to sequences found in GenBank, VectorBase, and FlyBase, or were similar to sequences with uncharacterized protein products. These transcripts represent exciting targets for future analysis. Results from this study suggest that WNV infection influences transcriptional changes in an invertebrate host target tissue that may confer an advantage to the replicating virus, induce a host defense response, and alter the composition of vector saliva. The ramifications of these changes are discussed in terms of mosquito vector competence and WNV pathogenesis.

TI  - Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Differential Gene Expression of Immune and Cell Death Pathways in the Brains of Mice Infected with West Nile Virus and Chikungunya Virus
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are arboviruses that are constantly (re-)emerging and expanding their territory. Both viruses often cause a mild form of disease, but severe forms of the disease can consist of neurological symptoms, most often observed in the elderly and young children, respectively, for which the mechanisms are poorly understood. To further elucidate the mechanisms responsible for end-stage WNV and CHIKV neuroinvasive disease, we used transcriptomics to compare the induction of effector pathways in the brain during the early and late stage of disease in young mice. In addition to the more commonly described cell death pathways such as apoptosis and autophagy, we also found evidence for the differential expression of pyroptosis and necroptosis cell death markers during both WNV and CHIKV neuroinvasive disease. In contrast, no evidence of cell dysfunction was observed, indicating that cell death may be the most important mechanism of disease. Interestingly, there was overlap when comparing immune markers involved in neuroinvasive disease to those seen in neurodegenerative diseases. Nonetheless, further validation studies are needed to determine the activation and involvement of these effector pathways at the end stage of disease. Furthermore, evidence for a strong inflammatory response was found in mice infected with WNV and CHIKV. The transcriptomics profile measured in mice with WNV and CHIKV neuroinvasive disease in our study showed strong overlap with the mRNA profile described in the literature for other viral neuroinvasive diseases. More studies are warranted to decipher the role of cell inflammation and cell death in viral neuroinvasive disease and whether common mechanisms are active in both neurodegenerative and brain infectious diseases.

TI  - Transcriptomic immune profiles of human flavivirus‐specific T‐cell responses
JF  - Immunology
VL  - 160
AB  - The Flavivirus genus of viruses includes dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), yellow fever (YFV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), and West Nile (WNV) viruses. Infections with these species combined are prevalent in tropical and sub‐tropical areas, affecting millions of people and ranging from asymptomatic to severe forms of the disease. They therefore pose a serious threat to global public health. Several studies imply a role for T cells in the protection but also pathogenesis against the different flavivirus species. Identifying flavivirus‐specific T‐cell immune profiles and determining how pre‐exposure of one species might affect the immune response against subsequent infections from other species is important to further define the role of T cells in the immune response against infection. Understanding the immune profiles of the flavivirus‐specific T‐cell response in natural infection is important to understand the T‐cell response in the context of vaccination. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on human immune profiles of flavivirus‐specific T‐cell reactivity, comparing natural infection with the acute form of the disease and vaccination in different flavivirus infections.

TI  - Transcriptomics of differential vector competence: West Nile virus infection in two populations of Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus linked to ovary development
JF  - BMC Genomics
VL  - 15
AB  - BackgroundUnderstanding mechanisms that contribute to viral dissemination in mosquito vectors will contribute to our ability to interfere with the transmission of viral pathogens that impact public health. The expression of genes in two Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus populations from Florida with known differences in vector competence to West Nile virus (WNV) were compared using high throughput sequencing.ResultsA total of 15,176 transcripts were combined for comparison of expression differences between the two populations and 118 transcripts were differentially expressed (p < 0.05). The fold change in expression of the differentially expressed genes ranged from -7.5 – 6.13. The more competent population for WNV (Gainesville) over expressed 77 genes and down regulated 44 genes, compared with the less competent population for WNV (Vero Beach). Also, splicing analysis identified 3 transcripts with significantly different splice forms between the two populations. The functional analysis showed that the largest proportion of transcripts was included in the catalytic activity and transporter activity groups except for those in the unknown group. Interestingly, the up- regulated gene set contained most of the catalytic activity function and the down- regulated gene set had a notable proportion of transcripts with transporter activity function. Immune response category was shown in only the down regulated gene set, although those represent a relatively small portion of the function. Several different vitellogenin genes were expressed differentially. Based on the RNAseq data analysis, ovary development was compared across the populations and following WNV infection. There were significant differences among the compared groups.ConclusionsThis study suggests that ovary development is correlated to vector competence in two Culex populations in Florida. Both populations control energy allocations to reproduction as a response to WNV. This result provides novel insight into the defense mechanism used by Culex spp. mosquitoes against WNV.

TI  - Translation elongation factor-1 alpha interacts with the 3' stem-loop region of West Nile virus genomic RNA
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 71
SP  - 6433
EP  - 6444
AB  - The conserved 3'-terminal stem-loop (3' SL) of the West Nile virus (WNV) genomic RNA was previously used to probe for cellular proteins that may be involved in flavivirus replication and three cellular proteins were detected that specifically interact with the WNV 3' SL RNA (J. L. Blackwell and M. A. Brinton, J. Virol. 69:5650-5658, 1995). In this study, one of these cellular proteins was purified to apparent homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation and liquid chromatography. Amino acid sequence Western blotting, and supershift analyses identified the cellular protein as translation elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha). Competition gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that the interaction between EF-1 alpha and WNV 3' SL RNA was specific. Dephosphorylation of EF-1 alpha by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase inhibited its binding to WNV 3' SL RNA. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction between EF-1 alpha and WNV 3' SL RNA was calculated to be 1.1 x 10(-9) M. Calculation of the stoichiometry of the interaction indicated that one molecule of EF-1 alpha binds to each molecule of WNV 3' SL RNA. Using RNase footprinting and nitrocellulose filter binding assays, we detected a high-activity binding site on the main stem of the WNV 3' SL RNA. Interaction with EF-1 alpha at the high-activity binding site was sequence specific, since nucleotide substitution in this region reduced the binding activity of the WNV 3' SL RNA for EF-1 alpha by approximately 60%. Two low-activity binding sites were also detected, and each accounted for approximately 15 to 20% of the binding activity. Intracellular association between the host protein and the viral RNA was suggested by coimmunoprecipitation of WNV genomic RNA and EF-1 alpha, using an anti-EF-1 alpha antibody.

TI  - Translation of the Flavivirus Kunjin NS3 Gene in cis but Not Its RNA Sequence or Secondary Structure Is Essential for Efficient RNA Packaging
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 11255
EP  - 11264
AB  - ABSTRACT Our previous studies using trans-complementation analysis of Kunjin virus (KUN) full-length cDNA clones harboring in-frame deletions in the NS3 gene demonstrated the inability of these defective complemented RNAs to be packaged into virus particles (W. J. Liu, P. L. Sedlak, N. Kondratieva, and A. A. Khromykh, J. Virol. 76:10766-10775). In this study we aimed to establish whether this requirement for NS3 in RNA packaging is determined by the secondary RNA structure of the NS3 gene or by the essential role of the translated NS3 gene product. Multiple silent mutations of three computer-predicted stable RNA structures in the NS3 coding region of KUN replicon RNA aimed at disrupting RNA secondary structure without affecting amino acid sequence did not affect RNA replication and packaging into virus-like particles in the packaging cell line, thus demonstrating that the predicted conserved RNA structures in the NS3 gene do not play a role in RNA replication and/or packaging. In contrast, double frameshift mutations in the NS3 coding region of full-length KUN RNA, producing scrambled NS3 protein but retaining secondary RNA structure, resulted in the loss of ability of these defective RNAs to be packaged into virus particles in complementation experiments in KUN replicon-expressing cells. Furthermore, the more robust complementation-packaging system based on established stable cell lines producing large amounts of complemented replicating NS3-deficient replicon RNAs and infection with KUN virus to provide structural proteins also failed to detect any secreted virus-like particles containing packaged NS3-deficient replicon RNAs. These results have now firmly established the requirement of KUN NS3 protein translated in cis for genome packaging into virus particles.

JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 65
AB  - It has been difficult to detect and visualize the physical nucleocapsid particles during the replication process of the flaviviruses. The use of cryo‐immunoelectron microscopy has clearly revealed the capsid proteins and nucleocapsid particles of West Nile (Sarafend) virus (a flavivirus) for the first time. Physical nucleocapsid particles accumulated in large numbers from 8 hr postinfection. Double immunolabeling of the envelope and capsid proteins showed a close association of these structural proteins for most of the replication cycle. By 10 hr postinfection, budding of nucelocapsids from the plasma membrane was very obvious. Although maturation at the plasma membrane was the dominant mode, during late infection, intracellular maturation into large vacuoles was also observed. J. Med.

TI  - Tregs control the development of symptomatic West Nile virus infection in humans and mice.
JF  - The Journal of clinical investigation
VL  - 119 11
SP  - 3266
EP  - 77
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) causes asymptomatic infection in most humans, but for undefined reasons, approximately 20% of immunocompetent individuals develop West Nile fever, a potentially debilitating febrile illness, and approximately 1% develop neuroinvasive disease syndromes. Notably, since its emergence in 1999, WNV has become the leading cause of epidemic viral encephalitis in North America. We hypothesized that CD4+ Tregs might be differentially regulated in subjects with symptomatic compared with those with asymptomatic WNV infection. Here, we show that in 32 blood donors with acute WNV infection, Tregs expanded significantly in the 3 months after index (RNA+) donations in all subjects. Symptomatic donors exhibited lower Treg frequencies from 2 weeks through 1 year after index donation yet did not show differences in systemic T cell or generalized inflammatory responses. In parallel prospective experimental studies, symptomatic WNV-infected mice also developed lower Treg frequencies compared with asymptomatic mice at 2 weeks after infection. Moreover, Treg-deficient mice developed lethal WNV infection at a higher rate than controls. Together, these results suggest that higher levels of peripheral Tregs after infection protect against severe WNV disease in immunocompetent animals and humans.

TI  - Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Protects against Lethal West Nile Virus Infection by Promoting Trafficking of Mononuclear Leukocytes into the Central Nervous System
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 8956
EP  - 8964
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus that has emerged globally as a significant cause of viral encephalitis in humans, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Previous studies have shown essential protective roles for antiviral cytokines (e.g., alpha interferon [IFN-α] and IFN-γ) against WNV in mice. However, studies using cell culture offer conflicting answers regarding whether tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) has an anti-WNV function. To test the biological significance of TNF-α against WNV in vivo, experiments were performed with TNF receptor-1 (TNF-R1)-deficient and TNF-α-depleted C57BL/6 mice. TNF-R1−/− mice had enhanced mortality and decreased survival time after WNV infection compared to congenic wild-type mice. Consistent with this, administration of a neutralizing anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody also decreased survival after WNV infection. Relatively small differences in viral burdens in peripheral tissues of TNF-R1−/− mice were observed, and this occurrence correlated with a modest antiviral effect of TNF-α on primary macrophages but not dendritic cells. In contrast, the viral titers detected in the central nervous systems of TNF-R1−/− mice were significantly increased compared to those of wild-type mice, although TNF-α did not have a direct antiviral effect in primary neuron cultures. Whereas no defect in priming of adaptive B- and T-cell responses in TNF-R1−/− mice was observed, there were significant reductions in accumulations of CD8+ T cells and macrophages in the brain. Our data are most consistent with a model in which interaction of TNF-α with TNF-R1 protects against WNV infection by regulating migration of protective inflammatory cells into the brain during acute infection.

TI  - Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Signaling May Contribute to Chronic West Nile Virus Post-infectious Proinflammatory State
JF  - Frontiers in Medicine
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: West Nile virus (WNV) causes a spectrum of human disease ranging from a febrile illness (WNV fever) to severe neuroinvasive disease (meningitis, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis). Since WNV gained entry into North America in 1999, clinicians caring for WNV survivors have observed persistent neurological symptoms occurring long-after the production of neutralizing antibodies and clearance of the virus. Accordingly, alternative pathogeneses other than direct viral invasion have been hypothesized to explain these post-infectious symptoms. The dominant hypothesis is that antiviral inflammatory responses triggered initially to clear WNV may persist to promote a post-infectious proinflammatory state. Methods: In 4 serologically-confirmed WNV patients with persistent post-infectious symptoms (3 WNV fever, 1 neuroinvasive disease), we ordered a comprehensive cytokine panel at weeks 8, 10, 12, and 36 months post-onset of illness, respectively, to better understand the pathophysiology of the protracted symptoms. Results: All patients had abnormally elevated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), a major molecule triggering antiviral cytokines and chronic inflammation in many human autoimmune diseases, but heretofore not reported to be upregulated in human WNV infection. Three patients also had elevations of other proinflammatory proteins. Major symptoms included fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, generalized or multifocal pain or weakness, imbalance, headaches, cognitive problems, and symptoms of dysautonomia. Conclusion: The findings provide support for an extended post-infectious proinflammatory state that may contribute to chronic inflammation and long-term morbidity in some WNV survivors and further suggest that TNF-α may play a pathogenic role in initiating this inflammatory environment. Clinical trials may be warranted to determine if TNF-α inhibitors or other immunosuppressive agents can improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Two Interferon-Stimulated Response Elements Cooperatively Regulate Interferon-Stimulated Gene Expression in West Nile Virus-Infected IFNAR−/− Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Type 1 IFN signaling in mammalian cells induces formation of the ISGF3 transcription factor complex, which binds to interferon stimulated response elements (ISREs) in the promoters of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the cell nucleus. Flavivirus proteins counteract type I IFN signaling by preventing either the formation or nuclear localization of ISGF3. ABSTRACT We previously identified a subset of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) upregulated by West Nile virus (WNV) infection in wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) after viral proteins had inhibited type I interferon (IFN)-mediated JAK-STAT signaling and also in WNV-infected RIG-I−/−, MDA5−/−, STAT1−/−, STAT2−/−, IFNAR−/−, IRF3−/−, IRF7−/−, and IRF3/7−/− MEFs. In this study, ISG upregulation by WNV infection in IFNAR−/− MEFs was confirmed by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). ISG upregulation by WNV infection was inhibited in RIG-I/MDA5−/− MEFs. ISGs were upregulated in IRF1−/− and IRF5−/− MEFs but only minimally upregulated in IRF3/5/7−/− MEFs, suggesting redundant IRF involvement. We previously showed that a single proximal interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) in the Oas1a and Oas1b promoters bound the ISGF3 complex after type I IFN treatment. In this study, we used wild-type and mutant promoter luciferase reporter constructs to identify critical regions in the Oas1b and Ifit1 promoters for gene activation in infected IFNAR−/− MEFs. Two ISREs were required in both promoters. Mutation of these ISREs in an Ifit1 promoter DNA probe reduced in vitro complex formation with infected nuclear extracts. An NF-κB inhibitor decreased Ifit1 promoter activity in cells and in vitro complex formation. IRF3 and p50 promoter binding was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for upregulated ISGs with two proximal ISREs. The data indicate that ISREs function cooperatively to upregulate the expression of some ISGs when type I IFN signaling is absent, with the binding complex consisting of IRF3, IRF5, and/or IRF7 and an NF-κB component(s) as well as other, as-yet-unknown factors. IMPORTANCE Type I IFN signaling in mammalian cells induces formation of the ISGF3 transcription factor complex, which binds to interferon stimulated response elements (ISREs) in the promoters of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the cell nucleus. Flavivirus proteins counteract type I IFN signaling by preventing either the formation or nuclear localization of ISGF3. A subset of ISRE-regulated ISGs was still induced in West Nile virus (WNV)-infected mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), indicating that cells have an alternative mechanism for activating these ISGs. In this study, cellular components involved in this ISG upregulation mechanism were identified using gene knockout MEFs and ChIP, and critical promoter regions for gene activation were mapped using reporter assays. The data indicate a cooperative function between two ISREs and required binding of IRF3, IRF5, and/or IRF7 and an NF-κB component(s). Moreover, type I IFN signaling-independent ISG activation requires different additional promoter activation regions than type I IFN-dependent activation.

TI  - Tyrosine 78 of premembrane protein is essential for assembly of West Nile virus.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 90 Pt 5
SP  - 1081
EP  - 92
AB  - Flavivirus premembrane (prM) protein plays an important role in conformational folding of the envelope (E) protein and protects it against premature fusion in acidic vesicles of the Golgi network. Currently, molecular determinants on the prM protein ectodomain which mediate critical steps during the flavivirus assembly process are poorly characterized. In this study, bioinformatics analysis and alanine scanning mutagenesis showed that the amino acid triplet valine 76, tyrosine 78 and glycine 79 is absolutely conserved among flavivirus prM ectodomains. Triple mutations engineered at these residues in prM ectodomain of West Nile virus (WNV) completely abrogated virus infectivity. Site-directed mutagenesis of prM protein revealed that tyrosine 78 of the amino acid triplet was required for virus infectivity and secretion. The mutation did not affect folding, post-translational modifications and trafficking of the prM and E proteins. Ultrastructural studies using transmission electron microscopy confirmed that virus particle formation was blocked by tyrosine 78 mutation. Specificity of assembly defect conferred by tyrosine 78 mutation was demonstrated by positive and negative trans complementation studies. Collectively, these results defined tyrosine 78 as a novel critical determinant present on prM protein ectodomain that is required for flavivirus assembly. Molecular dissection of prM protein function provides the crucial knowledge much needed in the elucidation of flavivirus particle formation.

EP  - 444
AB  - Abstract The ultrastructural features of West Nile virus (WNV) replication and dissemination in orally infected Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say were analyzed over a 25-d infection period. To investigate the effects of virus replication on membrane induction, cellular organization, and cell viability in midgut and salivary gland tissues, midguts were dissected on days 3, 7, 14, and 21, and salivary glands were collected on days 7, 14, 21, and 25 postinfection (d.p.i.) for examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Whole mosquito heads were embedded for TEM analysis 14 d.p.i. to localize WNV particles and to investigate the effects of replication on nervous tissues of the brain. Membrane proliferation was induced by WNV in the midgut epithelium, midgut muscles, and salivary glands, although extensive endoplasmic reticulum swelling was a unique feature of salivary gland infection. TEM revealed WNV-induced pathology in salivary glands at 14, 21, and 25 d.p.i., and we hypothesize that long-term virus infection of this tissue results in severe cellular degeneration and apoptotic-like cell death. This finding indicates that the efficiency of WNV transmission may decrease with mosquito age postinfection.

SP  - 577
EP  - 82
AB  - Ultrastructural changes in Aedes albopictus cells infected with Kunjin virus were characterized from 12 to 72 h post-infection. Early in infection (16h), there were no prominent ultrastructural changes except for an increase in the number of vacuoles in the cytoplasm. As the infection progressed the rough endoplasmic reticulum appeared to lengthen and whorls of fibres were observed within some vacuoles. Virus particles were observed in small numbers scattered in the cytoplasm between 24 to 30 h after infection. However, by 48 h, large numbers of morphologically mature virus particles were visible, usually in association with the rough endoplasmic reticulum, with the clusters of vesicles or with convoluted smooth membranes. Although no definite evidence of precursor particles or of budding of virions was obtained, the clusters of vesicles and the various membranous structures appeared to play a role in the morphogenesis of this virus. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that maturation of virus particles occurs within all these virus-induced structures.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 71
SP  - 6650
EP  - 6661
AB  - The subcellular location of the nonstructural proteins NS1, NS2B, and NS3 in Vero cells infected with the flavivirus Kunjin was investigated using indirect immunofluorescence and cryoimmunoelectron microscopy with monospecific antibodies. Comparisons were also made by dual immunolabelling using antibodies to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the putative template in the flavivirus replication complex. At 8 h postinfection, the immunofluorescent patterns showed NS1, NS2B, NS3, and dsRNA located in a perinuclear rim with extensions into the peripheral cytoplasm. By 16 h, at the end of the latent period, all patterns had changed to some discrete perinuclear foci associated with a thick cytoplasmic reticulum. By 24 h, this localization in perinuclear foci was more apparent and some foci were dual labelled with antibodies to dsRNA. In immuno-gold-labelled cryosections of infected cells at 24 h, all antibodies were associated with clusters of induced membrane structures in the perinuclear region. Two important and novel observations were made. First, one set of induced membranes comprised vesicle packets of smooth membranes dual labelled with anti-dsRNA and anti-NS1 or anti-NS3 antibodies. Second, adjacent masses of paracrystalline arrays or of convoluted smooth membranes, which appeared to be structurally related, were strongly labelled only with anti-NS2B and anti-NS3 antibodies. Paired membranes similar in appearance to the rough endoplasmic reticulum were also labelled, but less strongly, with antibodies to the three nonstructural proteins. Other paired membranes adjacent to the structures discussed above enclosed accumulated virus particles but were not labelled with any of the four antibodies. The collection of induced membranes may represent virus factories in which translation, RNA synthesis, and virus assembly occur.

TI  - Uncovering Flavivirus Host Dependency Factors through a Genome-Wide Gain-of-Function Screen
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - Flaviviruses, such as dengue (DENV), West Nile (WNV), yellow fever (YFV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, are mosquito-borne pathogens that present a major risk to global public health. To identify host factors that promote flavivirus replication, we performed a genome-wide gain-of-function cDNA screen for human genes that enhance the replication of flavivirus reporter particles in human cells. The screen recovered seventeen potential host proteins that promote viral replication, including the previously known dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase non-catalytic subunit (DDOST). Using silencing approaches, we validated the role of four candidates in YFV and WNV replication: ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19), ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), DDOST and importin 9 (IPO9). Applying a panel of virological, biochemical and microscopic methods, we validated further the role of RPL19 and DDOST as host factors required for optimal replication of YFV, WNV and ZIKV. The genome-wide gain-of-function screen is thus a valid approach to advance our understanding of flavivirus replication.

AB  - Many viral proteins undergo proteolytic processing events that are required for virus infection and virion assembly. In this issue of Biochemical Journal, Strongin and co-workers report that the NS3 protease from West Nile virus unexpectedly cleaves certain substrates at pairs of basic residues, a specificity that resembles that of the furin-like PCs (proprotein convertases). This led to the demonstration that furin/PC inhibitors containing poly(D-arginine) are also potent inhibitors of NS3, and that anthrax toxin protective antigen and myelin basic protein are potential NS3 substrates. Structural modelling based on Dengue virus NS3 provided a possible rationale for the observed cleavage specificity of West Nile virus NS3.

AB  - Tryptic digests of four polypeptides found in Kunjin virus-infected Vero cells, NV5, NV4, V3, and NV3, were compared by peptide mapping. The polypeptides to be analyzed were labeled with radioactive methionine and separated by electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. Because infection of Vero cells by Kunjin virus does not inhibit host cell protein synthesis, radioactively labeled viral polypeptides prepared from infected cells migrate coincidentally during sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis with some of the labeled host proteins. Thus, the genuine viral methionine-containing peptides in tryptic digests of viral proteins have been identified by co-analyzing polypeptides from [3H]methionine-labeled uninfected cells and [35S]methionine-labeled infected cells and determining the 35S/3H ratio in the peptides resolved in two dimensions on thin-layer chromatography plates. The peptide map of NV3 demonstrated that it is host coded, whereas NV5, NV4, and V3 have unique peptide maps and, therefore, account for approximately one-half of the coding potential of Kunjin virus RNA.

EP  - 29
AB  - An emergent challenge in macromolecular crystallography is the identification of the substructure from native anomalous scatterers in crystals that diffract to low to moderate resolution. Increasing the multiplicity of data sets has been shown to make previously intractable phasing problems solvable and to increase the useful resolution in model refinement. For the West Nile virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), a protein of novel fold, the utility of exceptionally high multiplicity data is demonstrated both in solving the crystal structure from the anomalous scattering of the native S atoms and in extending the useful limits of resolution during refinement. A high-multiplicity data set from 18 crystals had sufficient anomalous signal to identify sulfur sites using data to 5.2 Å resolution. Phases calculated to 4.5 Å resolution and extended to 3.0 Å resolution were of sufficient quality for automated building of three-quarters of the final structure. Crystallographic refinement to 2.9 Å resolution proceeded smoothly, justifying the increase in resolution that was made possible by combining multiple data sets. The identification and exclusion of data from outlier crystals is shown to result in more robust substructure determination.

TI  - Usutu virus and West Nile virus use a transcellular route of neuroinvasion across an in vitro model of the human blood-brain barrier
JF  - npj Viruses
VL  - 2
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) leads to thousands of cases of severe neurological disease in humans each year. Usutu virus (USUV) is closely related to WNV, but rarely induces disease in humans. We hypothesised that USUV is less able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and is therefore less likely to infect the brain. Therefore, we developed an in vitro BBB model consisting of primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), pericytes and astrocytes. Both USUV and WNV invaded across the in vitro BBB via a transcellular mechanism in absence of barrier disruption. USUV replicated to lower titres than WNV but induced a comparable cytokine and chemokine response, with modulation of key factors associated with barrier function and immune-cell migration. In conclusion, USUV appears attenuated in its ability to replicate at this interface compared with WNV, but further work must to done to identify key determinants underlying the differing clinical presentations.

TI  - VAMP8 Contributes to the TRIM6-Mediated Type I Interferon Antiviral Response during West Nile Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - WNV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses a threat to human health across large discontinuous areas throughout the world. Infection with WNV results in febrile illness, which can progress to severe neurological disease. Currently, there are no approved treatment options to control WNV infection. Understanding the cellular immune responses that regulate viral replication is important in diversifying the resources available to control WNV. Here, we show that the elimination of TRIM6 in human cells results in an increase in WNV replication and alters the expression and function of other components of the IFN-I pathway through VAMP8. Dissecting the interactions between WNV and host defenses both informs basic molecular virology and promotes the development of host- and virus-targeted antiviral strategies. ABSTRACT Several members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases regulate immune pathways, including the antiviral type I interferon (IFN-I) system. Previously, we demonstrated that TRIM6 is involved in IFN-I induction and signaling. In the absence of TRIM6, optimal IFN-I signaling is reduced, allowing increased replication of interferon-sensitive viruses. Despite having evolved numerous mechanisms to restrict the vertebrate host’s IFN-I response, West Nile virus (WNV) replication is sensitive to pretreatment with IFN-I. However, the regulators and products of the IFN-I pathway that are important in regulating WNV replication are incompletely defined. Consistent with WNV’s sensitivity to IFN-I, we found that in TRIM6 knockout (TRIM6-KO) A549 cells, WNV replication is significantly increased and IFN-I induction and signaling are impaired compared to wild-type (wt) cells. IFN-β pretreatment was more effective in protecting against subsequent WNV infection in wt cells than TRIM6-KO, indicating that TRIM6 contributes to the establishment of an IFN-induced antiviral response against WNV. Using next-generation sequencing, we identified VAMP8 as a potential factor involved in this TRIM6-mediated antiviral response. VAMP8 knockdown resulted in reduced JAK1 and STAT1 phosphorylation and impaired induction of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) following WNV infection or IFN-β treatment. Furthermore, VAMP8-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation required the presence of TRIM6. Therefore, the VAMP8 protein is a novel regulator of IFN-I signaling, and its expression and function are dependent on TRIM6 activity. Overall, these results provide evidence that TRIM6 contributes to the antiviral response against WNV and identify VAMP8 as a novel regulator of the IFN-I system. IMPORTANCE WNV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses a threat to human health across large discontinuous areas throughout the world. Infection with WNV results in febrile illness, which can progress to severe neurological disease. Currently, there are no approved treatment options to control WNV infection. Understanding the cellular immune responses that regulate viral replication is important in diversifying the resources available to control WNV. Here, we show that the elimination of TRIM6 in human cells results in an increase in WNV replication and alters the expression and function of other components of the IFN-I pathway through VAMP8. Dissecting the interactions between WNV and host defenses both informs basic molecular virology and promotes the development of host- and virus-targeted antiviral strategies.

TI  - VAMP8 contributes to TRIM6-mediated type-I interferon antiviral response during West Nile virus infection
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases regulate immune pathways including the antiviral type I interferon (IFN-I) system. Previously, we demonstrated that TRIM6 is involved in IFN-I induction and signaling. In absence of TRIM6 function, optimal IFN-I signaling is reduced, allowing increased replication of interferon-sensitive viruses. Despite numerous mechanisms to restrict vertebrate host’s IFN-I response, West Nile Virus (WNV) replication is sensitive to pre-treatment with IFN-I. However, the regulators and products of the IFN-I pathway important in regulating WNV replications are incompletely defined. Consistent with WNV’s sensitivity to IFN-I, we found that in TRIM6 knockout (TRIM6 KO) A549 cells WNV replication is significantly increased. Additionally, induction of Ifnb mRNA was delayed and the expression of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) was reduced in TRIM6 KO cells. IFNβ pre-treatment was more effective in protecting against subsequent WNV infection in wt cells, indicating that TRIM6 contributes to the establishment of an IFN-induced antiviral response against WNV. Using next generation sequencing, we identified potential factors involved in this TRIM6-mediated antiviral response. One identified gene, VAMP8, is a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) in the vesicle-associated membrane protein subfamily. Knockdown of VAMP8 resulted in reduced STAT1 phosphorylation and impaired induction of several ISGs following WNV infection or IFNβ treatment. Therefore, VAMP8 is a novel gene involved in the regulation of IFN-I signaling, and its expression is dependent on TRIM6 function. Overall, these results indicate that TRIM6 contributes to the antiviral response against WNV by regulating the IFN-I system.

JF  - Viruses
VL  - 5
SP  - 3021
EP  - 3047
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV; Flavivirus; Flaviviridae) is the cause of the most widespread arthropod-borne viral disease in the world and the largest outbreak of neuroinvasive disease ever observed. Mosquito-borne outbreaks are influenced by intrinsic (e.g., vector and viral genetics, vector and host competence, vector life-history traits) and extrinsic (e.g., temperature, rainfall, human land use) factors that affect virus activity and mosquito biology in complex ways. The concept of vectorial capacity integrates these factors to address interactions of the virus with the arthropod host, leading to a clearer understanding of their complex interrelationships, how they affect transmission of vector-borne disease, and how they impact human health. Vertebrate factors including host competence, population dynamics, and immune status also affect transmission dynamics. The complexity of these interactions are further exacerbated by the fact that not only can divergent hosts differentially alter the virus, but the virus also can affect both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts in ways that significantly alter patterns of virus transmission. This chapter concentrates on selected components of the virus-vector-vertebrate interrelationship, focusing specifically on how interactions between vector, virus, and environment shape the patterns and intensity of WNV transmission.

AB  - The re-emergence of the Old World flavivirus – West Nile in the Western hemisphere – has spurred intense research to decipher the host-cellular and viral determinants in contributing to West Nile virus pathogenesis. The increasing understanding of the complex interactions between West Nile virus and host cells will definitely help to accelerate the development of clinically effective antiviral therapies and a vaccine. In this review article, we present a perspective on the recent advances in revealing how the host-cellular factors are engaged during the entry, morphogenesis and assembly of West Nile virus.

VL  - 85 Pt 12

EP  - 45
AB  - Two New York (NY) strains of the West Nile (WN) virus were plaque-purified and four variants that had different amino acid sequences at the N-linked glycosylation site in the envelope (E) protein sequence were isolated. The E protein was glycosylated in only two of these strain variants. To determine the relationship between E protein glycosylation and pathogenicity of the WN virus, 6-week-old mice were infected subcutaneously with these variants. Mice infected with viruses that carried the glycosylated E protein developed lethal infection, whereas mice infected with viruses that carried the non-glycosylated E protein showed low mortality. In contrast, intracerebral infection of mice with viruses carrying either the glycosylated or non-glycosylated forms of the E protein resulted in lethal infection. These results suggested that E protein glycosylation is a molecular determinant of neuroinvasiveness in the NY strains of WN virus.

TI  - Viral-host molecular interactions and metabolic modulation: Strategies to inhibit flaviviruses pathogenesis
AB  - Flaviviruses, which include globally impactful pathogens, such as West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and dengue virus, contribute significantly to human infections. Despite the ongoing emergence and resurgence of flavivirus-mediated pathogenesis, the absence of specific therapeutic options remains a challenge in the prevention and treatment of flaviviral infections. Through the intricate processes of fusion, transcription, replication, and maturation, the complex interplay of viral and host metabolic interactions affects pathophysiology. Crucial interactions involve metabolic molecules, such as amino acids, glucose, fatty acids, and nucleotides, each playing a pivotal role in the replication and maturation of flaviviruses. These viral-host metabolic molecular interactions hijack and modulate the molecular mechanisms of host metabolism. A comprehensive understanding of these intricate metabolic pathways offers valuable insights, potentially unveiling novel targets for therapeutic interventions against flaviviral pathogenesis. This review emphasizes promising avenues for the development of therapeutic agents that target specific metabolic molecules, such as amino acids, glucose, fatty acids, and nucleotides, which interact with flavivirus replication and are closely linked to the modulation of host metabolism. The clinical limitations of current drugs have prompted the development of new inhibitory strategies for flaviviruses based on an understanding of the molecular interactions between the virus and the host.

JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 112
SP  - 14682
EP  - 14687
AB  - Significance Many viruses use phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors to gain entry into target cells, and phagocytes use these receptors to clear apoptotic cells. PS receptors mediate these activities by binding PS on the viruses or apoptotic cells. We demonstrate here that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is also a ligand for PS receptors, and that PE plays a key role in apoptotic cell clearance and infection of various pathogenic viruses, including West Nile, dengue, and Ebola viruses. This finding provides significant insights; it clarifies how PS receptors promote viral infection, suggests PE is a useful broad-spectrum antiviral target, and deepens our understanding of apoptosis and the process by which apoptotic cells are cleared. Phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors contribute to two crucial biological processes: apoptotic clearance and entry of many enveloped viruses. In both cases, they recognize PS exposed on the plasma membrane. Here we demonstrate that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is also a ligand for PS receptors and that this phospholipid mediates phagocytosis and viral entry. We show that a subset of PS receptors, including T-cell immunoglobulin (Ig) mucin domain protein 1 (TIM1), efficiently bind PE. We further show that PE is present in the virions of flaviviruses and filoviruses, and that the PE-specific cyclic peptide lantibiotic agent Duramycin efficiently inhibits the entry of West Nile, dengue, and Ebola viruses. The inhibitory effect of Duramycin is specific: it inhibits TIM1-mediated, but not L-SIGN-mediated, virus infection, and it does so by blocking virus attachment to TIM1. We further demonstrate that PE is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells, and promotes their phagocytic uptake by TIM1-expressing cells. Together, our data show that PE plays a key role in TIM1-mediated virus entry, suggest that disrupting PE association with PS receptors is a promising broad-spectrum antiviral strategy, and deepen our understanding of the process by which apoptotic cells are cleared.

TI  - Virus infection of the CNS disrupts the immune-neural-synaptic axis via induction of pleiotropic gene regulation of host responses
JF  - eLife
VL  - 10
AB  - Treatment for many viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) remains only supportive. Here we address a remaining gap in our knowledge regarding how the CNS and immune systems interact during viral infection. By examining the regulation of the immune and nervous system processes in a nonhuman primate model of West Nile virus neurological disease, we show that virus infection disrupts the homeostasis of the immune-neural-synaptic axis via induction of pleiotropic genes with distinct functions in each component of the axis. This pleiotropic gene regulation suggests an unintended off-target negative impact of virus-induced host immune responses on the neurotransmission, which may be a common feature of various viral infections of the CNS.

TI  - Virus-Induced Ca2+ Influx Extends Survival of West Nile Virus-Infected Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 8721
EP  - 8731
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) infection leads to rapid and sustained Ca2+ influx. This influx was observed with different strains of WNV and in different types of cells. Entry during virion endocytosis as well as through calcium channels contributed to the Ca2+ influx observed in WNV-infected cells. Ca2+ influx was not detected after infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and occurred only through endocytosis in Sindbis virus-infected cells. Caspase 3 cleavage and activation of several kinases, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2), and protein-serine kinase B alpha (Akt), at early times after WNV infection were shown to be dependent on Ca2+ influx. Although the activation of these kinases was sustained in virus-infected cells throughout infection, UV-inactivated WNV induced only a transient activation of FAK and ERK1/2 at early times after infection. The Ca2+-dependent FAK activation observed in WNV-infected cells was not mediated by αvβ3 integrins. Reduction of Ca2+ influx at early times of infection by various treatments decreased the viral yield and delayed both the early transient caspase 3 cleavage and the activation of FAK, Akt, and ERK signaling. The results indicate that Ca2+ influx is required for early infection events needed for efficient viral replication, possibly for virus-induced rearrangement of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Increased caspase 3 cleavage at both early (transient) and late times of infection correlated with decreased activation of the FAK and ERK1/2 pathways, indicating a role for these kinases in extending the survival of flavivirus-infected cells.

VL  - 63 2
SP  - 183
EP  - 92
AB  - The Vγ4(+) cells, a subpopulation of peripheral γδ T cells, are involved in West Nile virus (WNV) pathogenesis, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we found that WNV-infected Vγ4(+) cell-depleted mice had lower viremia and a reduced inflammatory response in the brain. The Vγ4(+) cells produced IL-17 during WNV infection, but blocking IL-17 signaling did not affect host susceptibility to WNV encephalitis. We also noted that there was an enhanced magnitude of protective splenic Vγ1(+) cell expansion in Vγ4(+) cell-depleted mice compared to that in controls during WNV infection. In addition, Vγ4(+) cells of WNV-infected mice had a higher potential for producing TGF-β. The γδ T cells of WNV-infected Vγ4(+) cell-depleted mice had a higher proliferation rate than those of WNV-infected controls upon ex vivo stimulation with anti-CD3, and this difference was diminished in the presence of TGF-β inhibitor. Finally, Vγ4(+) cells of infected mice contributed directly and indirectly to the higher level of IL-10, which is known to play a negative role in immunity against WNV infection. In summary, Vγ4(+) cells suppress Vγ1(+) cell expansion via TGF-β and increase IL-10 level during WNV infection, which together may lead to higher viremia and enhanced brain inflammation.

TI  - West Nile Virus (WNV) Replication Is Independent of Autophagy in Mammalian Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Autophagy is a homeostatic process responsible for recycling cytosolic proteins and organelles. Moreover, this pathway contributes to the cell’s intrinsic innate defenses. While many viruses have evolved mechanisms to antagonize the antiviral effects of the autophagy pathway, others subvert autophagy to facilitate replication. Here, we have investigated the role of autophagy in West Nile virus (WNV) replication. Experiments in cell lines derived from a variety of sources, including the kidney, liver, skin, and brain, indicated that WNV replication does not upregulate the autophagy pathway. Furthermore, WNV infection did not inhibit rapamycin-induced autophagy, suggesting that WNV does not disrupt the authophagy signaling cascade. Perturbation of the autophagy pathway by depletion of the major autophagy factors Atg5 or Atg7 had no effect on WNV infectious particle production, indicating that WNV does not require a functional autophagy pathway for replication. Taken together, the results of our study provide evidence that WNV, unlike several other viruses of the family Flaviviridae, does not significantly interact with the conventional autophagy pathway in mammalian cells.

TI  - West Nile Virus 5′-Cap Structure Is Formed by Sequential Guanine N-7 and Ribose 2′-O Methylations by Nonstructural Protein 5
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 8362
EP  - 8370
AB  - ABSTRACT Many flaviviruses are globally important human pathogens. Their plus-strand RNA genome contains a 5′-cap structure that is methylated at the guanine N-7 and the ribose 2′-OH positions of the first transcribed nucleotide, adenine (m7GpppAm). Using West Nile virus (WNV), we demonstrate, for the first time, that the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) mediates both guanine N-7 and ribose 2′-O methylations and therefore is essential for flavivirus 5′-cap formation. We show that a recombinant full-length and a truncated NS5 protein containing the methyltransferase (MTase) domain methylates GpppA-capped and m7GpppA-capped RNAs to m7GpppAm-RNA, using S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor. Furthermore, methylation of GpppA-capped RNA sequentially yielded m7GpppA- and m7GpppAm-RNA products, indicating that guanine N-7 precedes ribose 2′-O methylation. Mutagenesis of a K61-D146-K182-E218 tetrad conserved in other cellular and viral MTases suggests that NS5 requires distinct amino acids for its N-7 and 2′-O MTase activities. The entire K61-D146-K182-E218 motif is essential for 2′-O MTase activity, whereas N-7 MTase activity requires only D146. The other three amino acids facilitate, but are not essential for, guanine N-7 methylation. Amino acid substitutions within the K61-D146-K182-E218 motif in a WNV luciferase-reporting replicon significantly reduced or abolished viral replication in cells. Additionally, the mutant MTase-mediated replication defect could not be trans complemented by a wild-type replicase complex. These findings demonstrate a critical role for the flavivirus MTase in viral reproduction and underscore this domain as a potential target for antiviral therapy.

TI  - West Nile Virus Capsid Degradation of Claudin Proteins Disrupts Epithelial Barrier Function
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83
SP  - 6125
EP  - 6134
AB  - ABSTRACT During acute infection, West Nile virus (WNV) has been reported to infect a variety of cell types in various tissues of both experimentally and naturally infected hosts. Virus infects epithelial cells in the skin, kidney, intestine, and testes, although the importance of these findings is unclear. In the current study, we have observed that WNV infection of kidney tubules in mice coincides with the loss of expression of several members of the claudin family. Proteins of this family are often involved in epithelial barrier formation and function. WNV infection of epithelial cells in culture resulted in a decrease in the transepithelial electrical resistance, an increase in the efflux of mannitol across the monolayer, and a loss of intracellular levels of claudin-1 to -4. WNV capsid alone was sufficient for the degradation event, which was mediated through lysosomal proteases. Since epithelial cells are frequent sites of WNV infection, these observations imply a potential mechanism for virus dissemination and extraneural pathogenesis.

TI  - West Nile Virus Capsid Protein Interacts With Biologically Relevant Host Lipid Systems
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 9
AB  - West Nile and dengue viruses are closely related flaviviruses, originating mosquito-borne viral infections for which there are no effective and specific treatments. Their capsid proteins sequence and structure are particularly similar, forming highly superimposable α-helical homodimers. Measuring protein-ligand interactions at the single-molecule level yields detailed information of biological and biomedical relevance. In this work, such an approach was successfully applied on the characterization of the West Nile virus capsid protein interaction with host lipid systems, namely intracellular lipid droplets (an essential step for dengue virus replication) and blood plasma lipoproteins. Dynamic light scattering measurements show that West Nile virus capsid protein binds very low-density lipoproteins, but not low-density lipoproteins, and this interaction is dependent of potassium ions. Zeta potential experiments show that the interaction with lipid droplets is also dependent of potassium ions as well as surface proteins. The forces involved on the binding of the capsid protein with lipid droplets and lipoproteins were determined using atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy, proving that these interactions are K+-dependent rather than a general dependence of ionic strength. The capsid protein interaction with host lipid systems may be targeted in future therapeutic strategies against different flaviviruses. The biophysical and nanotechnology approaches employed in this study may be applied to characterize the interactions of other important proteins from different viruses, in order to understand their life cycles, as well as to find new strategies to inhibit them.

TI  - West Nile Virus Differentially Modulates the Unfolded Protein Response To Facilitate Replication and Immune Evasion
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 2723
EP  - 2732
AB  - ABSTRACT For intracellular survival it is imperative that viruses have the capacity to manipulate various cellular responses, including metabolic and biosynthetic pathways. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is induced by various external and internal stimuli, including the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Our previous studies have indicated that the replication and assembly of the flavivirus West Nile virus strain Kunjin virus (WNVKUN) is intimately associated with the ER. Thus, we sought to determine whether the UPR was induced during WNVKUN infection. WNVKUN induces UPR signaling during replication, which is coordinated with peak replication. Interestingly, signaling is biased toward the ATF6/IRE-1 arm of the response, with high levels of Xbp-1 activation but negligible eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α phosphorylation and downstream transcription. We show that the PERK-mediated response may partially regulate replication, since external UPR stimulation had a limiting effect on early replication events and cells deficient for PERK demonstrated increased replication and virus release. Significantly, we show that the WNVKUN hydrophobic nonstructural proteins NS4A and NS4B are potent inducers of the UPR, which displayed a high correlation in inhibiting Jak-STAT signaling in response to alpha interferon (IFN-α). Sequential removal of the transmembrane domains of NS4A showed that reducing hydrophobicity decreased UPR signaling and restored IFN-α-mediated activation. Overall, these results suggest that WNVKUN can stimulate the UPR to facilitate replication and that the induction of a general ER stress response, regulated by hydrophobic WNVKUN proteins, can potentiate the inhibition of the antiviral signaling pathway.

TI  - West Nile Virus Discriminates between DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR for Cellular Attachment and Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 1290
EP  - 1301
AB  - ABSTRACT The C-type lectins DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR bind mannose-rich glycans with high affinity. In vitro, cells expressing these attachment factors efficiently capture, and are infected by, a diverse array of appropriately glycosylated pathogens, including dengue virus. In this study, we investigated whether these lectins could enhance cellular infection by West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus related to dengue virus. We discovered that DC-SIGNR promoted WNV infection much more efficiently than did DC-SIGN, particularly when the virus was grown in human cell types. The presence of a single N-linked glycosylation site on either the prM or E glycoprotein of WNV was sufficient to allow DC-SIGNR-mediated infection, demonstrating that uncleaved prM protein present on a flavivirus virion can influence viral tropism under certain circumstances. Preferential utilization of DC-SIGNR was a specific property conferred by the WNV envelope glycoproteins. Chimeras between DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR demonstrated that the ability of DC-SIGNR to promote WNV infection maps to its carbohydrate recognition domain. WNV virions and subviral particles bound to DC-SIGNR with much greater affinity than DC-SIGN. We believe this is the first report of a pathogen interacting more efficiently with DC-SIGNR than with DC-SIGN. Our results should lead to the discovery of new mechanisms by which these well-studied lectins discriminate among ligands.

TI  - West Nile Virus Entry Requires Cholesterol-Rich Membrane Microdomains and Is Independent of αvβ3 Integrin
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 5212
EP  - 5219
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) has been the leading cause of viral encephalitis in the United States since 1999. The endocytic processes involved in the internalization of infectious WNV by various cell types are not well characterized, and the involvement of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts, in the life cycle of WNV has not been investigated previously. In this study, we found that the depletion of cellular cholesterol levels by brief treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin resulted in a 100-fold reduction of the titers of infectious WNV released into the culture supernatant, as well as a reduction in the number of WNV genome copies in the cholesterol-depleted cells. The addition of exogenous cholesterol to cholesterol-depleted cells reversed this effect. Cholesterol depletion postinfection did not affect WNV growth, suggesting that the effect occurs at the level of WNV entry. We also showed that while WNV entry did not require αvβ3 integrin and focal adhesion kinase, WNV particles failed to be internalized by cholesterol-depleted cells. Finally, we showed the colocalization of the WNV envelope protein and cholera toxin B, which is internalized in a lipid raft-dependent pathway, in microdomain clusters at the plasma membrane. These data suggest that WNV utilizes lipid rafts during initial stages of internalization and that the lipid rafts may contain a factor(s) that may enhance WNV endocytosis.

AB  - Abstract: The role of antibodies to the West Nile virus envelope (E) protein in serodiagnosis and protection was examined. The E protein was expressed and purified in recombinant form. Antibodies to the E protein were detected in patients with West Nile virus infection. Passive immunization with rabbit anti‐E protein sera also partially protected mice from challenge with West Nile virus. The humoral response to the West Nile virus E protein is therefore useful as an aid in the diagnosis and may also play a role in immunity to infection.

TI  - West Nile Virus Envelope Protein Inhibits dsRNA-Induced Innate Immune Responses1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 179
SP  - 8403
EP  - 8409
AB  - The immune response against viral infection relies on the early production of cytokines that induce an antiviral state and trigger the activation of immune cells. This response is initiated by the recognition of virus-associated molecular patterns such as dsRNA, a viral replication intermediate recognized by TLR3 and certain RNA helicases. Infection with West Nile virus (WNV) can lead to lethal encephalitis in susceptible individuals and constitutes an emerging health threat. In this study, we report that WNV envelope protein (WNV-E) specifically blocks the production of antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines induced by dsRNA in murine macrophages. This immunosuppressive effect was not dependent on TLR3 or its adaptor molecule Trif. Instead, our experiments show that WNV-E acts at the level of receptor-interacting protein 1. Our results also indicate that WNV-E requires a certain glycosylation pattern, specifically that of dipteran cells, to inhibit dsRNA-induced cytokine production. In conclusion, these data show that the major structural protein of WNV impairs the innate immune response and suggest that WNV exploits differential vector/host E glycosylation profiles to evade antiviral mechanisms.

TI  - West Nile Virus Evades Activation of Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 through RIG-I-Dependent and -Independent Pathways without Antagonizing Host Defense Signaling
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 2913
EP  - 2923
AB  - ABSTRACT The ability of viruses to control and/or evade the host antiviral response is critical to the establishment of a productive infection. We have previously shown that West Nile virus NY (WNV-NY) delays activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a transcription factor critical to the initiation of the antiviral response. Here we demonstrate that the delayed activation of IRF-3 is essential for WNV-NY to achieve maximum virus production. Furthermore, WNV-NY utilizes a unique mechanism to control activation of IRF-3. In contrast to many other viruses that impose a nonspecific block to the IRF-3 pathway, WNV-NY eludes detection by the host cell at early times postinfection. To better understand this process, we assessed the role of the pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) in sensing WNV-NY infection. RIG-I null mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) retained the ability to respond to WNV-NY infection; however, the onset of the host response was delayed compared to wild-type (WT) MEFs. This suggests that RIG-I is involved in initially sensing WNV-NY infection, while other PRRs sustain and/or amplify the host response later in infection. The delayed initiation of the host response correlated with an increase in WNV-NY replication in RIG-I null MEFs compared to WT MEFs. Our data suggest that activation of the host response by RIG-I early in infection is important for controlling replication of WNV-NY. Furthermore, pathogenic strains of WNV may have evolved to circumvent stimulation of the host response until after replication is well under way.

TI  - West Nile Virus Induced Cell Death in the Central Nervous System
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 8
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne, single-stranded flavivirus, has caused annual outbreaks of viral encephalitis in the United States since 1999. The virus induces acute infection with a clinical spectrum ranging from a mild flu-like febrile symptom to more severe neuroinvasive conditions, including meningitis, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and death. Some WNV convalescent patients also developed long-term neurological sequelae. Neither the treatment of WNV infection nor an approved vaccine is currently available for humans. Neuronal death in the central nervous system (CNS) is a hallmark of WNV-induced meningitis and encephalitis. However, the underlying mechanisms of WNV-induced neuronal damage are not well understood. In this review, we discuss current findings from studies of WNV infection in vitro in the CNS resident cells and the in vivo animal models, and provide insights into WNV-induced neuropathogenesis.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod-borne virus transmitted mainly by mosquito bites. Wild avifauna constitutes its natural reservoir. Mammals are dead-end hosts as they generally do not develop a viraemia high enough to trigger a new infection cycle. WNV belongs to the Flavivirus genus and can be responsible for a disease known as WN fever. Humans and horses are the most sensitive hosts as they may develop severe neurological signs. WNV has a worldwide distribution and caused numerous outbreaks since the late 1990s, most notably in North America and Europe. Lineage 1 strains have caused the most severe outbreaks to date. However, the situation has recently evolved with the emergence in the late 2000s of pathogenic lineage 2 strains in South Africa, Russia and Eastern and Southern Europe. Many developments in the fields of WN diagnosis and vaccination have been described in the recent years and may help control WNV spread. 
 
 
 
Key Concepts 
 
West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic arbovirus mainly transmitted by mosquitoes. It is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. 
WNV has a wide geographical range that includes Europe, the Middle East, Western Asia, Africa, Australia (Kunjin virus) and North, Central and South America. 
Most WNV infections are asymptomatic, but can be responsible for a disease known as WN fever (10–20% of WNV infections) or severe neurological signs (1–10% of WNV infections) in humans and horses. 
Humans and horses are the most sensitive hosts. 
Since the late 1990s, pathogenic WNV strains have begun to emerge. 
Diagnosis can be difficult as flaviviruses are antigenically related. 
There are no effective drugs or treatments against WNV infections. 
Approved vaccines are available in equids, and human vaccines are under development. 
Control of WNV outbreaks largely depends on vector control measures and interventions.

TI  - West Nile Virus Infection Activates the Unfolded Protein Response, Leading to CHOP Induction and Apoptosis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 10849
EP  - 10860
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV)-mediated neuronal death is a hallmark of WNV meningitis and encephalitis. However, the mechanisms of WNV-induced neuronal damage are not well understood. We investigated WNV neuropathogenesis by using human neuroblastoma cells and primary rat hippocampal neurons. We observed that WNV activates multiple unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways, leading to transcriptional and translational induction of UPR target genes. We evaluated the role of the three major UPR pathways, namely, inositol-requiring enzyme 1-dependent splicing of X box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA, activation of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase-dependent eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation, in WNV-infected cells. We show that XBP1 is nonessential or can be replaced by other UPR pathways in WNV replication. ATF6 was rapidly degraded by proteasomes, consistent with induction of ER stress by WNV. We further observed a transient phosphorylation of eIF2α and induction of the proapoptotic cyclic AMP response element-binding transcription factor homologous protein (CHOP). WNV-infected cells exhibited a number of apoptotic phenotypes, such as (i) induction of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 34, (ii) activation of caspase-3, and (iii) cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The expression of WNV nonstructural proteins alone was sufficient to induce CHOP expression. Importantly, WNV grew to significantly higher viral titers in chop−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) than in wild-type MEFs, suggesting that CHOP-dependent premature cell death represents a host defense mechanism to limit viral replication that might also be responsible for the widespread neuronal loss observed in WNV-infected neuronal tissue.

TI  - West Nile Virus Infection Causes Endocytosis of a Specific Subset of Tight Junction Membrane Proteins
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a blood-borne pathogen that causes systemic infections and serious neurological disease in human and animals. The most common route of infection is mosquito bites and therefore, the virus must cross a number of polarized cell layers to gain access to organ tissue and the central nervous system. Resistance to trans-cellular movement of macromolecules between epithelial and endothelial cells is mediated by tight junction complexes. While a number of recent studies have documented that WNV infection negatively impacts the barrier function of tight junctions, the intracellular mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood. In the present study, we report that endocytosis of a subset of tight junction membrane proteins including claudin-1 and JAM-1 occurs in WNV infected epithelial and endothelial cells. This process, which ultimately results in lysosomal degradation of the proteins, is dependent on the GTPase dynamin and microtubule-based transport. Finally, infection of polarized cells with the related flavivirus, Dengue virus-2, did not result in significant loss of tight junction membrane proteins. These results suggest that neurotropic flaviviruses such as WNV modulate the host cell environment differently than hemorrhagic flaviviruses and thus may have implications for understanding the molecular basis for neuroinvasion.

TI  - West Nile Virus Infection Modulates the Expression of Class I and Class II MHC Antigens on Astrocytes in Vitro
JF  - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
VL  - 540
AB  - The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens make an essential contribution to the antigen epitopes recognized by T lymphocytes, and the cell surface concentration of MHC antigen is an important variable in determining induction and effector function of T-cell-mediated immune responses. Therefore, the effect of viral infection on host MHC antigen expression may be an important mechanism modulating the immune response to certain viral infections. Flaviviruses are a group of viruses that cause neurologic diseases. We have chosen the West Nile virus (WNV) as representative of the group for the study of the pathogenesis of infection in the central nervous system. We investigated the effect of WNV infection on the expression of class I and class I1 MHC antigens on astrocytes prepared from CBA/H (H-2k) mouse neonates. West Nile virus productively infects astrocytes and concomitantly induces interferon production. West Nile virus infection up-regulates class I and class I1 MHC antigen expression on the cell surface as detected by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies specific for H-2Kk, H-2Dk, and H-21-A‘ (FIG. 1). Poly I:C, a synthetic interferon inducer, up-regulates class I MHC antigen expression to an extent similar to that obtained with WNV infection, but does not change class I1 MHC expression (FIG. l c and f). These data suggest that up-regulation of class I MHC antigens may be interferon dependent. West Nile virus infection enhances T-cell recognition of astrocytes. Astrocytes infected with influenza virus are not lysed by influenza virus immune cytotoxic T cells. However, astrocytes infected with WNV for 48 hours before influenza virus infection are susceptible to influenza virus immune cytotoxic T cells. Similarly, WNVinfected CBA/H (H-2 ’) astrocytes stimulate an H-21 k-specific alloreactive T-cell line, as measured by T-cell proliferation and interleukin-2 production, much more efficiently than do uninfected astrocytes. The stimulation can be blocked by H-21-Ak-specific monoclonal antibody (FIG. 2).

TI  - West Nile Virus Infections Suppress Early Viral RNA Synthesis and Avoid Inducing the Cell Stress Granule Response
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 3647
EP  - 3657
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) recently became endemic in the United States and is a significant cause of human morbidity and mortality. Natural WNV strain infections do not induce stress granules (SGs), while W956IC (a lineage 2/1 chimeric WNV infectious clone) virus infections produce high levels of early viral RNA and efficiently induce SGs through protein kinase R (PKR) activation. Additional WNV chimeric viruses made by replacing one or more W956IC genes with the lineage 1 Eg101 equivalent in the W956IC backbone were analyzed. The Eg-NS4b+5, Eg-NS1+3+4a, and Eg-NS1+4b+5 chimeras produced low levels of viral RNA at early times of infection and inefficiently induced SGs, suggesting the possibility that interactions between viral nonstructural proteins and/or between viral nonstructural proteins and cell proteins are involved in suppressing early viral RNA synthesis and membrane remodeling during natural WNV strain infections. Detection of exposed viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in W956IC-infected cells suggested that the enhanced early viral RNA synthesis surpassed the available virus-induced membrane protection and allowed viral dsRNA to activate PKR.

AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a human pathogen that can cause neurological disorders, including meningoencephalitis. Experiments with mice and mammalian cell cultures revealed that WNV exhibited resistance to the innate immune program induced by alpha interferon (IFN-α). We have investigated the nature of this inhibition and have found that WNV replication inhibited the activation of many known IFN-inducible genes, because it prevented the phosphorylation and activation of the Janus kinases JAK1 and Tyk2. As a consequence, activation of the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2 did not occur in WNV-infected cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that the viral nonstructural proteins are responsible for this effect. Thus, our results provided an explanation for the observed resistance of WNV to IFN-α in cells of vertebrate origin.

TI  - West Nile Virus Methyltransferase Catalyzes Two Methylations of the Viral RNA Cap through a Substrate-Repositioning Mechanism
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 4295
EP  - 4307
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses encode a single methyltransferase domain that sequentially catalyzes two methylations of the viral RNA cap, GpppA-RNA→m7GpppA-RNA→m7GpppAm-RNA, by using S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor. Crystal structures of flavivirus methyltransferases exhibit distinct binding sites for SAM, GTP, and RNA molecules. Biochemical analysis of West Nile virus methyltransferase shows that the single SAM-binding site donates methyl groups to both N7 and 2′-O positions of the viral RNA cap, the GTP-binding pocket functions only during the 2′-O methylation, and two distinct sets of amino acids in the RNA-binding site are required for the N7 and 2′-O methylations. These results demonstrate that flavivirus methyltransferase catalyzes two cap methylations through a substrate-repositioning mechanism. In this mechanism, guanine N7 of substrate GpppA-RNA is first positioned to SAM to generate m7GpppA-RNA, after which the m7G moiety is repositioned to the GTP-binding pocket to register the 2′-OH of the adenosine with SAM, generating m7GpppAm-RNA. Because N7 cap methylation is essential for viral replication, inhibitors designed to block the pocket identified for the N7 cap methylation could be developed for flavivirus therapy.

TI  - West Nile Virus NS1 Antagonizes Interferon Beta Production by Targeting RIG-I and MDA5
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes epidemics of encephalitis and viscerotropic disease worldwide. This virus has spread rapidly and has posed a significant public health threat since the outbreak in New York City in 1999. The interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral response represents an important component of virus-host interactions and plays an essential role in regulating viral replication. Previous studies have suggested that multifunctional nonstructural proteins encoded by flaviviruses antagonize the host IFN response via various means in order to establish efficient viral replication. In this study, we demonstrated that the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of WNV antagonizes IFN-β production, most likely through suppression of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) activation. In a dual-luciferase reporter assay, WNV NS1 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN-β promoter after Sendai virus infection or poly(I·C) treatment. NS1 also suppressed the activation of the IFN-β promoter when it was stimulated by interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)/5D or its upstream molecules in the RLR signaling pathway. Furthermore, NS1 blocked the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 upon stimulation by various inducers. Mechanistically, WNV NS1 targets RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) by interacting with them and subsequently causing their degradation by the proteasome. Furthermore, WNV NS1 inhibits the K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I, thereby inhibiting the activation of downstream sensors in the RLR signaling pathway. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which WNV NS1 interferes with the host antiviral response. IMPORTANCE WNV Nile virus (WNV) has received increased attention since its introduction to the United States. However, the pathogenesis of this virus is poorly understood. This study demonstrated that the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of WNV antagonizes the induction of interferon beta (IFN-β) by interacting with and degrading retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), which are crucial viral sensors in the host innate immune system. Further experiments suggested that NS1-mediated inhibition of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway involves inhibition of RIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination and that the proteasome plays a role in RIG-I degradation. This study provides new insights into the regulation of WNV NS1 in the RLR signaling pathway and reveals a novel mechanism by which WNV evades the host innate immune response. The novel findings may guide us to discover new therapeutic targets and develop effective vaccines for WNV infections.

VL  - 15 27

EP  - 84
AB  - West Nile Virus (WNV) has spread rapidly during the last decade across five continents causing disease and fatalities in humans and mammals. It highlights the serious threat to both our health and the economy posed by viruses crossing species, in this case from migratory birds via mosquitoes to mammals. There is no vaccine or antiviral drug for treating WNV infection. One attractive target for antiviral development is a viral trypsin-like serine protease, encoded by the N-terminal 184 amino acids of NS3, which is only active when tethered to its cofactor, NS2B. This protease, NS2B/NS3pro, cleaves the viral polyprotein to release structural and non-structural viral proteins that are essential in viral replication and assembly of new virus particles. Disruption of this protease activity is lethal for virus replication. The NS3 protein also has other enzymes within its sequence (helicase, nucleoside triphosphatase, RNA triphosphatase), all of which are tightly regulated through localisation within membranous compartments in the infected cell. This review describes the various roles of NS3, focussing on NS2B-NS3 protease and its function and regulation in WNV replication and infection. Current advances towards development of antiviral inhibitors of NS2B/NS3pro are examined along with obstacles to their development as an antiviral therapy.

TI  - West Nile Virus Noncoding Subgenomic RNA Contributes to Viral Evasion of the Type I Interferon-Mediated Antiviral Response
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 5708
EP  - 5718
AB  - ABSTRACT We previously showed that a noncoding subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) is required for viral pathogenicity, as a mutant West Nile virus (WNV) deficient in sfRNA production replicated poorly in wild-type mice. To investigate the possible immunomodulatory or immune evasive functions of sfRNA, we utilized mice and cells deficient in elements of the type I interferon (IFN) response. Replication of the sfRNA mutant WNV was rescued in mice and cells lacking interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and IRF-7 and in mice lacking the type I alpha/beta interferon receptor (IFNAR), suggesting a contribution for sfRNA in overcoming the antiviral response mediated by type I IFN. This was confirmed by demonstrating rescue of mutant virus replication in the presence of IFNAR neutralizing antibodies, greater sensitivity of mutant virus replication to IFN-α pretreatment, partial rescue of its infectivity in cells deficient in RNase L, and direct effects of transfected sfRNA on rescuing replication of unrelated Semliki Forest virus in cells pretreated with IFN-α. The results define a novel function of sfRNA in flavivirus pathogenesis via its contribution to viral evasion of the type I interferon response.

TI  - West Nile Virus Nonstructural Protein 1 Inhibits TLR3 Signal Transduction
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 8262
EP  - 8271
AB  - ABSTRACT The innate immune response is the first line of defense against foreign pathogens. The recognition of virus-associated molecular patterns, including double- and single-stranded RNA, by pattern recognition receptors initiates a cascade of signaling reactions. These result in the transcriptional upregulation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines that induce an antiviral state. Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to antagonize these responses in order to help them establish a productive infection. We have previously shown that West Nile virus (WNV) is able to inhibit Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-mediated activation of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (F. Scholle and P. W. Mason, Virology 342:77-87, 2005). In the present study, the WNV nonstructural (NS) proteins were analyzed individually for their ability to antagonize signal transduction mediated by TLR3. We report that expression of WNV NS1 inhibits TLR3-induced transcriptional activation of the IFN-β promoter and of an NF-κB-responsive promoter. This inhibition was due to a failure of the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) to induce nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-κB. Furthermore, NS1 expression also inhibited TLR3-dependent production of interleukin-6 and the establishment of an antiviral state. The function of NS1 in flavivirus infection is not well understood. NS1 is required for viral RNA replication and is also secreted from mammalian cells but not from insect cells. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized role for NS1 in the modulation of signaling pathways of the innate immune response to WNV infection.

TI  - West Nile Virus Replication Requires Fatty Acid Synthesis but Is Independent on Phosphatidylinositol-4-Phosphate Lipids
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 6
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurovirulent mosquito-borne flavivirus, which main natural hosts are birds but it also infects equines and humans, among other mammals. As in the case of other plus-stranded RNA viruses, WNV replication is associated to intracellular membrane rearrangements. Based on results obtained with a variety of viruses, different cellular processes have been shown to play important roles on these membrane rearrangements for efficient viral replication. As these processes are related to lipid metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, as well as generation of a specific lipid microenvironment enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), has been associated to it in other viral models. In this study, intracellular membrane rearrangements following infection with a highly neurovirulent strain of WNV were addressed by means of electron and confocal microscopy. Infection of WNV, and specifically viral RNA replication, were dependent on fatty acid synthesis, as revealed by the inhibitory effect of cerulenin and C75, two pharmacological inhibitors of fatty acid synthase, a key enzyme of this process. However, WNV infection did not induce redistribution of PI4P lipids, and PI4P did not localize at viral replication complex. Even more, WNV multiplication was not inhibited by the use of the phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase inhibitor PIK93, while infection by the enterovirus Coxsackievirus B5 was reduced. Similar features were found when infection by other flavivirus, the Usutu virus (USUV), was analyzed. These features of WNV replication could help to design specific antiviral approaches against WNV and other related flaviviruses.

TI  - West Nile Virus Restriction in Mosquito and Human Cells: A Virus under Confinement
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 8
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging neurotropic flavivirus that naturally circulates between mosquitoes and birds. However, WNV has a broad host range and can be transmitted from mosquitoes to several mammalian species, including humans, through infected saliva during a blood meal. Although WNV infections are mostly asymptomatic, 20% to 30% of cases are symptomatic and can occasionally lead to severe symptoms, including fatal meningitis or encephalitis. Over the past decades, WNV-carrying mosquitoes have become increasingly widespread across new regions, including North America and Europe, which constitutes a public health concern. Nevertheless, mosquito and human innate immune defenses can detect WNV infection and induce the expression of antiviral effectors, so-called viral restriction factors, to control viral propagation. Conversely, WNV has developed countermeasures to escape these host defenses, thus establishing a constant arms race between the virus and its hosts. Our review intends to cover most of the current knowledge on viral restriction factors as well as WNV evasion strategies in mosquito and human cells in order to bring an updated overview on WNV–host interactions.

TI  - West Nile Virus Spreads Transsynaptically within the Pathways of Motor Control: Anatomical and Ultrastructural Mapping of Neuronal Virus Infection in the Primate Central Nervous System
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 10
AB  - Background During recent West Nile virus (WNV) outbreaks in the US, half of the reported cases were classified as neuroinvasive disease. WNV neuroinvasion is proposed to follow two major routes: hematogenous and/or axonal transport along the peripheral nerves. How virus spreads once within the central nervous system (CNS) remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the expression of viral antigens in the CNS of rhesus monkeys that were intrathalamically inoculated with a wild-type WNV. The localization of WNV within the CNS was mapped to specific neuronal groups and anatomical structures. The neurological functions related to structures containing WNV-labeled neurons were reviewed and summarized. Intraneuronal localization of WNV was investigated by electron microscopy. The known anatomical connectivity of WNV-labeled neurons was used to reconstruct the directionality of WNV spread within the CNS using a connectogram design. Anatomical mapping revealed that all structures identified as containing WNV-labeled neurons belonged to the pathways of motor control. Ultrastructurally, virions were found predominantly within vesicular structures (including autophagosomes) in close vicinity to the axodendritic synapses, either at pre- or post-synaptic positions (axonal terminals and dendritic spines, respectively), strongly indicating transsynaptic spread of the virus between connected neurons. Neuronal connectivity-based reconstruction of the directionality of transsynaptic virus spread suggests that, within the CNS, WNV can utilize both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport to infect connected neurons. Conclusions/Significance This study offers a new insight into the neuropathogenesis of WNV infection in a primate model that closely mimics WNV encephalomyelitis in humans. We show that within the primate CNS, WNV primarily infects the anatomical structures and pathways responsible for the control of movement. Our findings also suggest that WNV most likely propagates within the CNS transsynaptically, by both, anterograde and retrograde axonal transport.

TI  - West Nile Virus Subgenomic RNAs Modulate Gene Expression in a Neuronal Cell Line
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - Subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) are small non-coding products of the incomplete degradation of viral genomic RNA. They accumulate during flaviviral infection and have been associated with many functional roles inside the host cell. Studies so far have demonstrated that sfRNA plays a crucial role in determining West Nile virus (WNV) pathogenicity. However, its modulatory role on neuronal homeostasis has not been studied in depth. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of sfRNA biosynthesis and its importance for WNV replication in neuronal cells. We found that sfRNA1 is functionally redundant for both replication and translation of WNV. However, the concurrent absence of sfRNA1 and sfRNA2 species is detrimental for the survival of the virus. Differential expression analysis on RNA-seq data from WT and ΔsfRNA replicon cell lines revealed transcriptional changes induced by sfRNA and identified a number of putative targets. Overall, it was shown that sfRNA contributes to the viral evasion by suppressing the interferon-mediated antiviral response. An additional differential expression analysis among replicon and control Neuro2A cells also clarified the transcriptional changes that support WNV replication in neuronal cells. Increased levels of translation and oxidative phosphorylation, post-translational modification processes, and activated DNA repair pathways were observed in replicon cell lines, while developmental processes such as axonal growth were deficient.

TI  - West Nile Virus Subverts T Cell Stimulatory Capacity of Human Dendritic Cells
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus and the leading cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis in the United States. Recent studies in humans have found that dysfunctional T cell responses strongly correlate with development of severe WNV neuroinvasive disease. However, the contributions of human dendritic cells (DCs) in priming WNV-specific T cell immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) support productive viral replication following infection with a pathogenic strain of WNV. Antiviral effector gene transcription was strongly induced during the log-phase viral growth, while secretion of type I interferons (IFN) occurred with delayed kinetics. Activation of RIG-I like receptor (RLR) or type I IFN signaling prior to log-phase viral growth significantly diminished viral replication, suggesting that activation of antiviral programs early can block WNV infection. In contrast to the induction of antiviral responses, WNV infection did not promote transcription or secretion of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, GM-CSF, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL9) or T cell modulatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-12, IL-15). There was also minimal induction of molecules associated with antigen presentation and T cell priming, including the co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, and CD40. Functionally, WNV-infected moDCs dampened allogenic CD4 and CD8 T cell activation and proliferation. Combined, we propose a model where WNV subverts human DC activation to compromise priming of WNV-specific T cell immunity. Importance West Nile virus (WNV) is an encephalitic flavivirus that remains endemic in the United States. Previous studies have found dysfunctional T cell responses correlate to severe disease outcomes during human WNV infection. Here, we sought to better understand the ability of WNV to program human dendritic cells (DCs) to prime WNV-specific T cell responses. While productive infection of monocyte-derived DCs activated antiviral and type I interferon responses, molecules associated with inflammation and programming of T cells were minimally induced. Functionally, WNV-infected DCs dampened T cell activation and proliferation during an allogeneic response. Combined, our data supports a model where WNV infection of human DCs compromises WNV-specific T cell immunity.

TI  - West Nile Virus Temperature Sensitivity and Avian Virulence Are Modulated by NS1-2B Polymorphisms
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 10
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) replicates in a wide variety of avian species, which serve as reservoir and amplification hosts. WNV strains isolated in North America, such as the prototype strain NY99, elicit a highly pathogenic response in certain avian species, notably American crows (AMCRs; Corvus brachyrhynchos). In contrast, a closely related strain, KN3829, isolated in Kenya, exhibits a low viremic response with limited mortality in AMCRs. Previous work has associated the difference in pathogenicity primarily with a single amino acid mutation at position 249 in the helicase domain of the NS3 protein. The NY99 strain encodes a proline residue at this position, while KN3829 encodes a threonine. Introduction of an NS3-T249P mutation in the KN3829 genetic background significantly increased virulence and mortality; however, peak viremia and mortality were lower than those of NY99. In order to elucidate the viral genetic basis for phenotype variations exclusive of the NS3-249 polymorphism, chimeric NY99/KN3829 viruses were created. We show herein that differences in the NS1-2B region contribute to avian pathogenicity in a manner that is independent of and additive with the NS3-249 mutation. Additionally, NS1-2B residues were found to alter temperature sensitivity when grown in avian cells.

TI  - West Nile Virus spread and differential chemokine response in the central nervous system of mice: role in pathogenic mechanisms of encephalitis.
JF  - Transboundary and emerging diseases
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic mosquito-borne flavivirus able to cause severe neurological disease in humans, horses and various avian species. The more severe pathological changes of neurotropic WNV infection are caused by virus neuroinvasion and/or the immunological response in the central nervous system (CNS). The extent in which inflammatory cell trafficking orchestrated by chemokines is involved in the pathogenesis of CNS lesions has not been entirely elucidated. To understand the sequence of pro-inflammatory chemokine induction during WNV encephalitis, a murine intranasal inoculation model was used. The relationship between lesional patterns in the mice CNS, the viral antigen distribution and the expression of pro-inflammatory chemokine (CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL10) were evaluated. Viral antigen was first observed in olfactory tract and pyriform cortex neurons, suggesting a retrograde neuronal infection from the olfactory nerve. A spatio-temporal association between WNV antigen and perivascular cuffs development was observed. Chemokine immunostaining was widely distributed in the brain from early stages. CCL2 immunolabelling was localised in neurons, astrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells as well as mononuclear leukocytes within perivascular cuffs. In contrast, CCL5 and CXCL10 immunostaining was mainly observed in astroglia and neurons, respectively. A strong correlation was demonstrated between the presence of perivascular cuffs and CCL2 and CCL5 expression in most brain areas, while CXCL10 was only associated with inflammatory lesions in few specific regions. Importantly, a strong correlation between WNV and CCL5 distribution was observed. However, no correlation was observed between CXCL10 and viral antigen. Neurons were confirmed as the main target cells of WNV, as well as one of the sources of CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL10. This study shows the sequence and comparative distribution pattern between histological lesions, WNV antigen and chemokine expression over the infection process. Furthermore, it identifies potential targets for immune intervention to suppress damaging chemokine responses.

TI  - West Nile Virus-Inclusive Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Reveals Heterogeneity in the Type I Interferon Response within Single Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a clinically relevant pathogen responsible for recurrent epidemics of neuroinvasive disease. Type I interferon is essential for promoting an antiviral response against WNV infection; however, it is unclear how heterogeneity in the antiviral response at the single-cell level impacts viral control. Specifically, conventional approaches lack the ability to distinguish differences across cells with varying viral abundance. The significance of our research is to demonstrate a new technique for studying WNV infection at the single-cell level. We discovered extensive variation in antiviral gene expression and viral abundance across cells. This protocol can be applied to primary cells or in vivo models to better understand the underlying cellular heterogeneity following WNV infection for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic mosquito-borne flavivirus of global importance. Neuroinvasive WNV infection results in encephalitis and can lead to prolonged neurological impairment or death. Type I interferon (IFN-I) is crucial for promoting antiviral defenses through the induction of antiviral effectors, which function to restrict viral replication and spread. However, our understanding of the antiviral response to WNV infection is mostly derived from analysis of bulk cell populations. It is becoming increasingly apparent that substantial heterogeneity in cellular processes exists among individual cells, even within a seemingly homogenous cell population. Here, we present WNV-inclusive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), an approach to examine the transcriptional variation and viral RNA burden across single cells. We observed that only a few cells within the bulk population displayed robust transcription of IFN-β mRNA, and this did not appear to depend on viral RNA abundance within the same cell. Furthermore, we observed considerable transcriptional heterogeneity in the IFN-I response, with genes displaying high unimodal and bimodal expression patterns. Broadly, IFN-stimulated genes negatively correlated with viral RNA abundance, corresponding with a precipitous decline in expression in cells with high viral RNA levels. Altogether, we demonstrated the feasibility and utility of WNV-inclusive scRNA-seq as a high-throughput technique for single-cell transcriptomics and WNV RNA detection. This approach can be implemented in other models to provide insights into the cellular features of protective immunity and identify novel therapeutic targets. IMPORTANCE West Nile virus (WNV) is a clinically relevant pathogen responsible for recurrent epidemics of neuroinvasive disease. Type I interferon is essential for promoting an antiviral response against WNV infection; however, it is unclear how heterogeneity in the antiviral response at the single-cell level impacts viral control. Specifically, conventional approaches lack the ability to distinguish differences across cells with varying viral abundance. The significance of our research is to demonstrate a new technique for studying WNV infection at the single-cell level. We discovered extensive variation in antiviral gene expression and viral abundance across cells. This protocol can be applied to primary cells or in vivo models to better understand the underlying cellular heterogeneity following WNV infection for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

TI  - West Nile Virus-Induced Activation of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 Supports Viral Growth and Viral Protein Expression
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 9458
EP  - 9471
AB  - ABSTRACT Since its introduction in New York City, NY, in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has spread to all 48 contiguous states of the United States and is now the leading cause of epidemic encephalitis in North America. As a member of the family Flaviviridae, WNV is part of a group of clinically important human pathogens, including dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus. The members of this family of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses have limited coding capacity and are therefore obligated to co-opt a significant amount of cellular factors to translate their genomes effectively. Our previous work has shown that WNV growth was independent of macroautophagy activation, but the role of the evolutionarily conserved mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway during WNV infection was not well understood. mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase that acts as a central cellular censor of nutrient status and exercises control of vital anabolic and catabolic cellular responses such as protein synthesis and autophagy, respectively. We now show that WNV activates mTOR and cognate downstream activators of cap-dependent protein synthesis at early time points postinfection and that pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR (KU0063794) significantly reduced WNV growth. We used an inducible Raptor and Rictor knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) system to further define the role of mTOR complexes 1 and 2 in WNV growth and viral protein synthesis. Following inducible genetic knockout of the major mTOR cofactors raptor (TOR complex 1 [TORC1]) and rictor (TORC2), we now show that TORC1 supports flavivirus protein synthesis via cap-dependent protein synthesis pathways and supports subsequent WNV growth. IMPORTANCE Since its introduction in New York City, NY, in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has spread to all 48 contiguous states in the United States and is now the leading cause of epidemic encephalitis in North America. Currently, the mechanism by which flaviviruses such as WNV translate their genomes in host cells is incompletely understood. Elucidation of the host mechanisms required to support WNV genome translation will provide broad understanding for the basic mechanisms required to translate capped viral RNAs. We now show that WNV activates mTOR and cognate downstream activators of cap-dependent protein synthesis at early time points postinfection. Following inducible genetic knockout of the major mTOR complex cofactors raptor (TORC1) and rictor (TORC2), we now show that TORC1 supports WNV growth and protein synthesis. This study demonstrates the requirement for TORC1 function in support of WNV RNA translation and provides insight into the mechanisms underlying flaviviral RNA translation in mammalian cells.

TI  - West Nile Virus-Induced Cell Adhesion Molecules on Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells Regulate Leukocyte Adhesion and Modulate Permeability of the In Vitro Blood-Brain Barrier Model
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - Characterizing the mechanisms by which West Nile virus (WNV) causes blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, leukocyte infiltration into the brain and neuroinflammation is important to understand the pathogenesis of WNV encephalitis. Here, we examined the role of endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) in mediating the adhesion and transendothelial migration of leukocytes across human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVE). Infection with WNV (NY99 strain) significantly induced ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin in human endothelial cells and infected mice brain, although the levels of their ligands on leukocytes (VLA-4, LFA-1and MAC-1) did not alter. The permeability of the in vitro BBB model increased dramatically following the transmigration of monocytes and lymphocytes across the models infected with WNV, which was reversed in the presence of a cocktail of blocking antibodies against ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin. Further, WNV infection of HBMVE significantly increased leukocyte adhesion to the HBMVE monolayer and transmigration across the infected BBB model. The blockade of these CAMs reduced the adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes across the infected BBB model. Further, comparison of infection with highly neuroinvasive NY99 and non-lethal (Eg101) strain of WNV demonstrated similar level of virus replication and fold-increase of CAMs in HBMVE cells suggesting that the non-neuropathogenic response of Eg101 is not because of its inability to infect HBMVE cells. Collectively, these results suggest that increased expression of specific CAMs is a pathological event associated with WNV infection and may contribute to leukocyte infiltration and BBB disruption in vivo. Our data further implicate that strategies to block CAMs to reduce BBB disruption may limit neuroinflammation and virus-CNS entry via ‘Trojan horse’ route, and improve WNV disease outcome.

TI  - West Nile Virus-Induced Expression of Senescent Gene Lgals3bp Regulates Microglial Phenotype within Cerebral Cortex
JF  - Biomolecules
VL  - 14
AB  - Microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, exhibit altered gene expression in response to various neurological conditions. This study investigates the relationship between West Nile Virus infection and microglial senescence, focusing on the role of LGALS3BP, a protein implicated in both antiviral responses and aging. Using spatial transcriptomics, RNA sequencing and flow cytometry, we characterized changes in microglial gene signatures in adult and aged mice following recovery from WNV encephalitis. Additionally, we analyzed Lgals3bp expression and generated Lgals3bp-deficient mice to assess the impact on neuroinflammation and microglial phenotypes. Our results show that WNV-activated microglia share transcriptional signatures with aged microglia, including upregulation of genes involved in interferon response and inflammation. Lgals3bp was broadly expressed in the CNS and robustly upregulated during WNV infection and aging. Lgals3bp-deficient mice exhibited reduced neuroinflammation, increased homeostatic microglial numbers, and altered T cell populations without differences in virologic control or survival. These data indicate that LGALS3BP has a role in regulating neuroinflammation and microglial activation and suggest that targeting LGALS3BP might provide a potential route for mitigating neuroinflammation-related cognitive decline in aging and post-viral infections.

TI  - West Nile Virus-Induced Interferon Production Is Mediated by the Double-Stranded RNA-Dependent Protein Kinase PKR
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 11148
EP  - 11158
AB  - ABSTRACT Cells carry a variety of molecules, referred to as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which are able to sense invading pathogens. Interaction of PRRs with viral compounds instigates a signaling pathway(s), resulting in the activation of genes, including those for type I interferon (IFN), which are critical for an effective antiviral response. Here we demonstrate that the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase PKR, which has been shown to function as a PRR in cells treated with the dsRNA mimetic poly(I:C), serves as a PRR in West Nile virus (WNV)-infected cells. Evidence for PKR's role as a PRR was obtained from both human and murine cells. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we demonstrated that PKR gene knockout, posttranscriptional gene silencing of PKR mRNA using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and chemical inhibition of PKR function all interfered with IFN synthesis following WNV infection. In three different human cell lines, siRNA knockdown and chemical inhibition of PKR blocked WNV-induced IFN synthesis. Using the same approaches, we demonstrated that PKR was not necessary for Sendai virus-induced IFN synthesis, suggesting that PKR is particularly important for recognition of WNV infection. Taken together, our data suggest that PKR could serve as a PRR for recognition of WNV infection.

TI  - West Nile Virus-Induced Neuroinflammation: Glial Infection and Capsid Protein-Mediated Neurovirulence
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 10933
EP  - 10949
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) infection causes neurological disease at all levels of the neural axis, accompanied by neuroinflammation and neuronal loss, although the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. Given the substantial activation of neuroinflammatory pathways observed in WNV infection, we hypothesized that WNV-mediated neuroinflammation and cell death occurred through WNV infection of both glia and neurons, which was driven in part by WNV capsid protein expression. Analysis of autopsied neural tissues from humans with WNV encephalomyelitis (WNVE) revealed WNV infection of both neurons and glia. Upregulation of proinflammatory genes, CXCL10, interleukin-1β, and indolamine-2′,3′-deoxygenase with concurrent suppression of the protective astrocyte-specific endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor gene, OASIS (for old astrocyte specifically induced substance), was evident in WNVE patients compared to non-WNVE controls. These findings were supported by increased ex vivo expression of these proinflammatory genes in glia infected by WNV-NY99. WNV infection caused endoplasmic reticulum stress gene induction and apoptosis in neurons but did not affect glial viability. WNV-infected astrocytic cells secreted cytotoxic factors, which caused neuronal apoptosis. The expression of the WNV-NY99 capsid protein in neurons and glia by a Sindbis virus-derived vector (SINrep5-WNVc) caused neuronal death and the release of neurotoxic factors by infected astrocytes, coupled with proinflammatory gene induction and suppression of OASIS. Striatal implantation of SINrep5-WNVC induced neuroinflammation in rats, together with the induction of CXCL10 and diminished OASIS expression, compared to controls. Moreover, magnetic resonance neuroimaging showed edema and tissue injury in the vicinity of the SINrep5-WNVc implantation site compared to controls, which was complemented by neurobehavioral abnormalities in the SINrep5-WNVc-implanted animals. These studies underscore the important interactions between the WNV capsid protein and neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of WNV-induced neurological disorders.

VL  - 94 Pt 2
SP  - 308
EP  - 13
AB  - The flavivirus NS2A protein is a small, multifunctional protein, involved in replication, virion formation and regulation of the innate immune response. Using the Kunjin strain of West Nile virus (WNV(KUN)) we previously demonstrated that a single amino acid change from alanine to proline at position 30 of the NS2A protein (A30P) reduced viral cytopathicity in cells and virulence in mice. To further investigate functions of the NS2A protein we have substituted alanine at position 30 with different amino acids (A30 mutants) in a WNV(KUN) infectious clone. The virulence of mutant viruses in wild-type (WT) and IRF3/IRF7 double-knockout mice was influenced by the amino acid change and ranged from high to low in the order of WT>A30L>A30E>A30P/A30G. Moreover, infection of beta interferon (IFN-β)-deficient Vero cells with A30P virus showed less pronounced chromosomal DNA degradation and lower percentage of cells with positive TUNEL labelling than in WT virus infection, indicating a role for the WT NS2A protein in IFN-independent apoptotic cell death.

AB  - Background. West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in the United States. It is transmissible by blood transfusion, and the nation's blood supply is currently screened for WNV. Documented transmission of WNV infection through red blood cell (RBC) units in which the plasma co-component had a low viral load could be explained, in at least 1 instance, by cell-association of WNV; in this case, the RBC unit was released as negative by minipool nucleic acid testing (NAT) performed on plasma but was intermittently NAT-positive when subsequently tested as an individual sample. We hypothesized that a proportion of WNV bound to blood cells and was not measured by NAT performed on plasma samples. We have investigated whether WNV binds to RBCs, leading to reduction of WNV RNA detection by NAT performed on plasma samples.Methods. Equal volumes of leukoreduced RBCs and their corresponding plasma components from 20 blood donors with NAT results that were positive for WNV were tested in 5 replicates by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction TaqMan for WNV. In addition, aliquots from 8 of the RBC units were tested by infectivity assays using Vero cells.Results. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction TaqMan assay showed that the viral load in the RBC components exceeded that in the corresponding plasma units by 1 order of magnitude. In addition, viruses associated with the RBCs were infectious in Vero cell cultures.Conclusions. These observations reinforce the notion that extraction of viral RNA from whole blood could improve assay sensitivity for blood donor screening and further reduce the residual risk of WNV transmission through transfusion.

TI  - West Nile virus and dengue virus capsid protein negates the antiviral activity of human Sec3 protein through the proteasome pathway
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 15
AB  - Flavivirus capsid (C) protein is a key structural component of virus particles. The non‐structural role of C protein in the pathogenesis of arthropod‐borne flaviviruses is not clearly deciphered. This study showed that West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV) utilized C protein to reduce human Sec3p (hSec3p) levels at post‐transcriptional level through activation of chymotrypsin‐like proteolytic function of 20S proteasome. Mutagenesis studies confirmed amino acids 14, 109–114 of WNV C protein and 13, 102–107 of DENV C protein played an important role in activating the proteolytic function of 20S proteasome. Amino acid residues at 14 (WNV) and 13 (DENV) of C protein were important for C protein‐hSec3p binding and physical interaction between C protein and hSec3p was essential to execute hSec3p degradation. Degradation motif required to degrade hSec3p resided between amino acid residues 109–114 of WNV C protein and 102–107 of DENV C protein. Proteasomes, hSec3p binding motif and degradation motif on C protein must be intact for efficient flavivirus production. Clinical isolates of DENV showed more pronounced effect in manipulating the proteasomes and reducing hSec3p levels. This study portrayed the non‐structural function of C protein that helped the flavivirus to nullify the antiviral activity of hSec3p by accelerating its degradation and facilitating efficient binding of elongation factor 1α with flaviviral RNA genome.

TI  - West Nile virus capsid protein induces p53‐mediated apoptosis via the sequestration of HDM2 to the nucleolus
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 10
SP  - 165
EP  - 176
AB  - The capsid protein of the West Nile virus (WNV) functions as an apoptotic agonist via the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction and the activation of caspases‐9 and ‐3. Here, we have determined that the WNV capsid (WNVCp) is capable of binding to and sequestering HDM2 into the nucleolus. WNVCp was shown to interfere with the formation of the HDM2 and p53 complex, thereby causing the stabilization of p53 and the subsequent induction of its target apoptotic protein, Bax. Whereas WNVCp was capable of inducing the p53‐dependent apoptotic process in wild‐type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) or SH‐SY5Y cells, it exerted no significant effects on p53‐null MEF or on p53‐knockdown SH‐SY5Y cells. This suggests that WNVCp‐mediated apoptosis requires p53. Furthermore, when WNV was transfected into cells, endogenous Hdm2 and WNVCp were able to interact physically. WNVCp expressed in wild‐type MEF proved able to induce the translocation of the endogenous Hdm2 into the nucleolus. Consistently, WNV was highly pathogenic in the presence of p53, and was less so in the absence of p53. The results of these studies suggest that the apoptotic mechanism mediated by WNV might occur in accordance in a fashion similar to that of the tumour‐suppressing mechanism mediated by ARF.

TI  - West Nile virus capsid protein inhibits autophagy by AMP-activated protein kinase degradation in neurological disease development
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) belongs to the Flaviviridae family and has emerged as a significant cause of viral encephalitis in birds and animals including humans. WNV replication directly induces neuronal injury, followed by neuronal cell death. We previously showed that accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates was involved in neuronal cell death in the WNV-infected mouse brain. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the mechanisms of the accumulation of protein aggregates in the WNV-infected cells. To identify the viral factor inducing the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, intracellular accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins was examined in the cells expressing the viral protein. Expression of capsid (C) protein induced the accumulation, while mutations at residues L51 and A52 in C protein abrogated the accumulation. Wild-type (WT) or mutant WNV in which mutations were introduced into the residues was inoculated into human neuroblastoma cells. The expression levels of LC3-II, an autophagy-related protein, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an autophagy inducer, were reduced in the cells infected with WT WNV, while the reduction was not observed in the cells infected with WNV with the mutations in C protein. Similarly, ubiquitination and degradation of AMPK were only observed in the cells infected with WT WNV. In the cells expressing C protein, AMPK was co-precipitated with C protein and mutations in L51 and A52 reduced the interaction. Although the viral replication was not affected, the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in brain and neurological symptoms were attenuated in the mouse inoculated with WNV with the mutations in C protein as compared with that with WT WNV. Taken together, ubiquitination and degradation of AMPK by C protein resulted in the inhibition of autophagy and the accumulation of protein aggregates, which contributes to the development of neurological disease.

TI  - West Nile virus encodes a microRNA-like small RNA in the 3′ untranslated region which up-regulates GATA4 mRNA and facilitates virus replication in mosquito cells

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) belongs to a group of medically important single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses causing deadly disease outbreaks around the world. The 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the flavivirus genome, in particular the terminal 3′ stem–loop (3′SL) fulfils multiple functions in virus replication and virus–host interactions. Using the Kunjin strain of WNV (WNVKUN), we detected a virally encoded small RNA, named KUN-miR-1, derived from 3′SL. Transcription of WNVKUN pre-miRNA (3′SL) in mosquito cells either from plasmid or Semliki Forest virus (SFV) RNA replicon resulted in the production of mature KUN-miR-1. Silencing of Dicer-1 but not Dicer-2 led to a reduction in the miRNA levels. Further, when a synthetic inhibitor of KUN-miR-1 was transfected into mosquito cells, replication of viral RNA was significantly reduced. Using cloning and bioinformatics approaches, we identified the cellular GATA4 mRNA as a target for KUN-miR-1. KUN-miR-1 produced in mosquito cells during virus infection or from plasmid DNA, SFV RNA replicon or mature miRNA duplex increased accumulation of GATA4 mRNA. Depletion of GATA4 mRNA by RNA silencing led to a significant reduction in virus RNA replication while a KUN-miR-1 RNA mimic enhanced replication of a mutant WNVKUN virus producing reduced amounts of KUN-miR-1, suggesting that GATA4-induction via KUN-miR-1 plays an important role in virus replication.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 79 ( Pt 10)
SP  - 2375
EP  - 80
AB  - Several neuroinvasive and non-neuroinvasive West Nile (WN) viruses were characterized by nucleotide sequencing of their envelope (E) protein regions. Prolonged passage in mosquito cells caused loss of neuroinvasiveness and acquisition of an N-linked glycosylation site, which is utilized. Limited passage in cell culture also caused glycosylation but not attenuation, suggesting that glycosylation may not be directly responsible for attenuation and that a second mutation (L68 --> P) may also be involved. A monoclonal antibody-neutralization escape mutant with a substitution at residue 307, a site common to other flavivirus escape mutants, was also attenuated. A partially neuroinvasive revertant regained the parental E sequence, implying that determinants outside of the E region may also influence attenuation. Data suggest that the neuroinvasive determinants may be similar to those for other flaviviruses. Also, sequence comparison with the WN virus (Nigeria) strain revealed considerable divergence of the E protein at the nucleotide and amino acid levels.

TI  - West Nile virus nonstructural protein NS1 inhibits complement activation by binding the regulatory protein factor H
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 103
SP  - 19111
EP  - 19116
AB  - The complement system, by virtue of its dual effector and priming functions, is a major host defense against pathogens. Flavivirus nonstructural protein (NS)-1 has been speculated to have immune evasion activity, because it is a secreted glycoprotein, binds back to cell surfaces, and accumulates to high levels in the serum of infected patients. Herein, we demonstrate an immunomodulatory function of West Nile virus NS1. Soluble and cell-surface-associated NS1 binds to and recruits the complement regulatory protein factor H, resulting in decreased complement activation in solution and attenuated deposition of C3 fragments and C5b–9 membrane attack complexes on cell surfaces. Accordingly, extracellular NS1 may function to minimize immune system targeting of West Nile virus by decreasing complement recognition of infected cells.

AB  - Using West Nile virus strain Kunjin virus (WNV(KUN)) as a model system for flavivirus replication, we showed that the virus replication complex (RC) is associated with the dsRNA template located in induced membranes only in the cytoplasm. In this report we established for the first time that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5 is located in flavivirus-induced membranes, including the site of viral RNA replication. We found no evidence for nuclear localization of the essential RC components NS5 and its dsRNA template for WNV(KUN) or the closely related WNV strain Sarafend, by immuno-electron microscopy or by immunofluorescence. Metabolic radiolabelling with [(32)P]orthophosphate revealed that WNV(KUN) NS5 was phosphorylated and this was confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies specific for phosphorylated serine and threonine only. These observations of a cytoplasmic location for the WNV polymerase and its phosphorylation state correspond to the characteristics of the hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase NS5B.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 88 Pt 11
SP  - 3013
EP  - 7
AB  - The human MxA protein is a type I and III interferon (IFN)-induced protein with proven antiviral activity against RNA viruses. In this study, we investigated the effect of MxA expression on the replication of West Nile Virus strain Kunjin (WNV(KUN)). Pretreatment of A549 cells with IFN-alpha lead to increased expression of MxA, which contributed to inhibition of WNV(KUN) replication and secretion. However, in Vero cells stably expressing the MxA protein, WNV(KUN) replication, maturation and secretion was not inhibited. Biochemical and subcellular localization studies of WNV(KUN) proteins and MxA suggest that the MxA activity was not compromised by a flavivirus-encoded antagonist. Instead, we show that characteristic membranous structures induced during WNV(KUN) replication provide partial protection from MxA, possibly by 'hiding' WNV(KUN) replication components. This distinct compartmentalization of viral replication and components of the cellular antiviral response may be an evolutionary mechanism by which flaviviruses can hide from host surveillance.

EP  - 203
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis is characterized by neuroinflammation, neuronal loss and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. However, the mechanisms associated with the BBB disruption are unclear. Complex interactions between the tight junction proteins (TJP) and the adherens junction proteins (AJP) of the brain microvascular endothelial cells are responsible for maintaining the BBB integrity. Herein, we characterized the relationship between the BBB disruption and expression kinetics of key TJP, AJP and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the mice brain. A dramatic increase in the BBB permeability and extravasation of IgG was observed at later time points of the central nervous system (CNS) infection and did not precede virus-CNS entry. WNV-infected mice exhibited significant reduction in the protein levels of the TJP ZO-1, claudin-1, occludin and JAM-A, and AJP β-catenin and vascular endothelial cadherin, which correlated with increased levels of MMP-1, -3 and -9 and infiltrated leukocytes in the brain. Further, intracranial inoculation of WNV also demonstrated increased extravasation of IgG in the brain, suggesting the role of virus replication in the CNS in BBB disruption. These data suggest that altered expression of junction proteins is a pathological event associated with WNV infection and may explain the molecular basis of BBB disruption. We propose that WNV initially enters CNS without altering the BBB integrity and later virus replication in the brain initiates BBB disruption, allowing enhanced infiltration of immune cells and contribute to virus neuroinvasion via the 'Trojan-horse' route. These data further implicate roles of multiple MMPs in the BBB disruption and strategies to interrupt this process may influence the WNV disease outcome.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV), a flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family, is maintained in nature in an enzootic transmission cycle between avian hosts and ornithophilic mosquito vectors, although the virus occasionally infects other vertebrates. WNV causes sporadic disease outbreaks in horses and humans, which may result in febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis and flaccid paralysis. Until recently, its medical and veterinary health concern was relatively low; however, the number, frequency and severity of outbreaks with neurological consequences in humans and horses have lately increased in Europe and the Mediterranean basin. Since its introduction in the Americas, the virus spread across the continent with worrisome consequences in bird mortality and a considerable number of outbreaks among humans and horses, which have resulted in the largest epidemics of neuroinvasive WNV disease ever documented. Surprisingly, its incidence in human and animal health is very different in Central and South America, and the reasons for it are not yet understood. Even though great advances have been obtained lately regarding WNV infection, and although efficient equine vaccines are available, no specific treatments or vaccines for human use are on the market. This review updates the most recent investigations in different aspects of WNV life cycle: molecular virology, transmission dynamics, host range, clinical presentations, epidemiology, ecology, diagnosis, control, and prevention, and highlights some aspects that certainly require further research.

TI  - West Nile virus: an overview of current information
JF  - Translational Medicine Reports
AB  - West Nile Virus (WNV) is a vector-borne flavivirus primarily infecting mosquitoes, birds, horses and humans. WNV is responsible for asymptomatic infections or a variety of clinical manifestations ranging from mild febrile illness to neuroinvasive disease. The frequency and severity of WNV-related disease have lately increased in the European Union and in the neighbouring countries, with particular concern for the Mediterranean area. This trend is probably connected to a raise in both average temperatures and rainfall, favourable factors for WNV spread. Due to the marked and expanding geographical distribution of the vector and the high endemic potential of WNV, this virus is worldwide considered an increasing public health apprehension. An augmented burden of WNV severe illness has been reported. Alarmingly, no vaccine or specific antiviral treatments are currently available for WNV infection. Hereafter, we will review the available information summarizing molecular biology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, epidemiology, diagnosis and therapy for WNV infection in humans.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has spread rapidly throughout the U.S. and there is currently no effective treatment. Understanding the pathogenesis of WNV infection in humans is critical for development of a potent therapy. In this study, we examined the activation of primary human macrophages in response to WNV infection, and showed that WNV interacts with human macrophages at multiple levels. While infection with WNV induced production of interleukin (IL)-8, production of IL-1beta, and type I interferon was inhibited. Infection with WNV interferes with the downstream JAK/STAT pathway, which is important for macrophage activation. In comparison to other related flaviviruses, the differential response of proinflammatory cytokines is distinct to WNV.

TI  - Wolbachia Enhances West Nile Virus (WNV) Infection in the Mosquito Culex tarsalis
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 8
AB  - Novel strategies are required to control mosquitoes and the pathogens they transmit. One attractive approach involves maternally inherited endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria. After artificial infection with Wolbachia, many mosquitoes become refractory to infection and transmission of diverse pathogens. We evaluated the effects of Wolbachia (wAlbB strain) on infection, dissemination and transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) in the naturally uninfected mosquito Culex tarsalis, which is an important WNV vector in North America. After inoculation into adult female mosquitoes, Wolbachia reached high titers and disseminated widely to numerous tissues including the head, thoracic flight muscles, fat body and ovarian follicles. Contrary to other systems, Wolbachia did not inhibit WNV in this mosquito. Rather, WNV infection rate was significantly higher in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes compared to controls. Quantitative PCR of selected innate immune genes indicated that REL1 (the activator of the antiviral Toll immune pathway) was down regulated in Wolbachia-infected relative to control mosquitoes. This is the first observation of Wolbachia-induced enhancement of a human pathogen in mosquitoes, suggesting that caution should be applied before releasing Wolbachia-infected insects as part of a vector-borne disease control program.

TI  - Wolbachia enhances insect‐specific flavivirus infection in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
JF  - Ecology and Evolution
VL  - 8
SP  - 5441
EP  - 5454
AB  - Abstract Mosquitoes transmit a diverse group of human flaviviruses including West Nile, dengue, yellow fever, and Zika viruses. Mosquitoes are also naturally infected with insect‐specific flaviviruses (ISFs), a subgroup of the family not capable of infecting vertebrates. Although ISFs are not medically important, they are capable of altering the mosquito's susceptibility to flaviviruses and may alter host fitness. Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium of insects that when present in mosquitoes limits the replication of co‐infecting pathogens, including flaviviruses. Artificially created Wolbachia‐infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are being released into the wild in a series of trials around the globe with the hope of interrupting dengue and Zika virus transmission from mosquitoes to humans. Our work investigated the effect of Wolbachia on ISF infection in wild‐caught Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from field release zones. All field mosquitoes were screened for the presence of ISFs using general degenerate flavivirus primers and their PCR amplicons sequenced. ISFs were found to be common and widely distributed in Ae. aegypti populations. Field mosquitoes consistently had higher ISF infection rates and viral loads compared to laboratory colony material indicating that environmental conditions may modulate ISF infection in Ae. aegypti. Surprisingly, higher ISF infection rates and loads were found in Wolbachia‐infected mosquitoes compared to the Wolbachia‐free mosquitoes. Our findings demonstrate that the symbiont is capable of manipulating the mosquito virome and that Wolbachia‐mediated viral inhibition is not universal for flaviviruses. This may have implications for the Wolbachia‐based DENV control strategy if ISFs confer fitness effects or alter mosquito susceptibility to other flaviviruses.

TI  - Wolbachia strain wAlbB blocks replication of flaviviruses and alphaviruses in mosquito cell culture
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 13
AB  - Wolbachia pipientis are bacterial endosymbionts of arthropods currently being implemented as biocontrol agents to reduce the global burden of arboviral diseases. Some strains of Wolbachia, when introduced into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, reduce or block the replication of RNA viruses pathogenic to humans. The wAlbB strain of Wolbachia was originally isolated from Aedes albopictus, and when transinfected into Ae. aegypti, persists in mosquitoes under high temperature conditions longer than other strains. The utility of wAlbB to block a broad spectrum of RNA viruses has received limited attention. Here we test the ability of wAlbB to reduce or block the replication of a range of Flavivirus and Alphavirus species in cell culture. The C6/36 mosquito cell line was stably infected with the wAlbB strain using the shell-vial technique. The replication of dengue, West Nile and three strains of Zika (genus Flavivirus), and Ross River, Barmah Forest and Sindbis (genus Alphavirus) viruses was compared in wAlbB-infected cells with Wolbachia-free controls. Infectious virus titres were determined using either immunofocus or plaque assays. A general linear model was used to test for significant differences in replication between flaviviruses and alphaviruses. Titres of all viruses were significantly reduced in cell cultures infected with wAlbB versus Wolbachia-free controls. The magnitude of reduction in virus yields varied among virus species and, within species, also among the strains utilized. Our results suggest that wAlbB infection of arthropods could be used to reduce transmission of a wide range of pathogenic RNA viruses.

TI  - Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking in mosquito cells is dependent on XRN1-mediated viral RNA degradation and influenced by viral replication rate
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - Wolbachia is currently being developed as a novel tool to block the transmission of dengue viruses (DENV) by Aedes aegypti. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the DENV-blocking phenotype in mosquitoes, including competition for fatty acids like cholesterol, manipulation of host miRNAs and upregulation of innate immune pathways in the mosquito. We examined the various stages in the DENV infection process to better understand the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking (WMVB). Our results suggest that infection with Wolbachia does not inhibit DENV binding or cell entry, but reduces virus replication. In contrast to a previous report, we also observed a similar reduction in replication of West Nile virus (WNV). This reduced replication is associated with rapid viral RNA degradation in the cytoplasm. We didn’t find a role for host miRNAs in WMVB. Further analysis showed that the 3’ end of the virus subgenomic RNA was protected and accumulated over time suggesting that the degradation is XRN1-mediated. We also found that sub genomic flavivirus RNA accumulation inactivated XRN1 in mosquito cells in the absence of Wolbachia and led to enhancement of RNA degradation in its presence. Depletion of XRN1 decreased WMVB which was associated with a significant increase in DENV RNA. We also observed that WMVB is influenced by virus MOI and rate of virus replication. A comparatively elevated blocking was observed for slowly replicating DENV, compared to WNV. Similar results were obtained while analysing different DENV serotypes.

TI  - Z-DNA-Binding Protein 1 Is Critical for Controlling Virus Replication and Survival in West Nile Virus Encephalitis
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV), a neurotropic flavivirus, is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in the United States. Recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have caused serious neurological diseases and birth defects, specifically Guillain-Barrè syndrome and microcephaly. Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) is a cytoplasmic sensor that that has been shown to play a significant role in initiating a robust immune response. We previously reported that WNV and ZIKV infections induce dramatic up-regulation of ZBP1 in mouse brains as well as in infected primary mouse cells. Herein, we show the critical role of ZBP1 in restricting the pathogenesis of WNV and ZIKV infections. Deletion of ZBP1 resulted in significantly higher morbidity and mortality after infection with a pathogenic WNV NY99 strain in mice. No mortality was observed in wild-type (WT) mice infected with the non-pathogenic WNV strain, Eg101. Interestingly, infection of ZBP1−/− mice with WNV Eg101 was lethal resulting in 100% mortality, suggesting that ZBP1 is required for survival after WNV infection. Viremia and brain viral load were significantly higher in ZBP1−/− mice compared to WT mice. In addition, protein levels of interferon (IFN)-α, and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly higher in the serum and brains of infected ZBP1−/− mice compared to the WT mice. Primary mouse cortical neurons and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from ZBP1−/− mice produced higher virus titers compared to WT cells after infection with WNV NY99 and WNV Eg101. Similarly, neurons and MEFs lacking ZBP1 exhibited significantly enhanced replication of PRVABC59 (Asian) and MR766 (African) ZIKV compared to WT cells. The knockout of ZBP1 function in MEFs inhibited ZBP1-dependent virus-induced cell death. In conclusion, these data reveal that ZBP1 restricts WNV and ZIKV production in mouse cells and is required for survival of a peripheral WNV infection in mice.

JF  - Uirusu

AB  - It has previously been shown that the Flavivirus West Nile Virus (WNV) enters the macrophagelike cell line P 388D 1 rapidly on warming to 37°C. Initially particles are internalized in coated vesicles and subsequently appear in endosomes and then lysosomes. WNV particles have been shown to fuse with artificial liposomes optimally at mild acidic pH. In the present study, interaction between WNV and P 388D 1 cells was assayed by following the association of Pronase-resistant 35S-labelled virus with cells. Transmission and Scanning electron microscopy were also used for this purpose. Virus particles were shown to have an increased affinity for the cell structure at pH below 7.0. This was shown to be because virus particles were fusing in a pH-dependent manner with maximum fusion occuring at pH6.4 or below. We have previously showed that lysosomotropic amines can inhibit WNV infection by raising the pH in the endosomal compartments. It is thus probable that acid pH-dependent fusion is important in release of the WNV nuclear capsid from endosome to the cytosol. Radiobinding study and electron microscopy showed that a balance exists between endocytosis and fusion of Flaviviruses with the P 388D 1 cell plasma membrane, with pH of extracellular medium deciding which one predominates.

TI  - cis- and trans-Acting Elements in Flavivirus RNA Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 74

EP  - 3263
AB  - ABSTRACT Most of the seven flavivirus nonstructural proteins (NS1 to NS5) encoded in the distal two-thirds of the RNA positive-sense genome are believed to be essential components of RNA replication complexes. To explore the functional relationships of these components in RNA replication, we used trans-complementation analysis of full-length infectious RNAs of Kunjin (KUN) virus with a range of lethal in-frame deletions in the nonstructural coding region, using as helper a repBHK cell line stably producing functional replication complexes from KUN replicon RNA. Recently we showed that replication of KUN RNAs with large carboxy-terminal deletions including the entire RNA polymerase region in the NS5 gene, representing 34 to 75% of the NS5 coding content, could be complemented after transfection into repBHK cells. In this study we have demonstrated that KUN RNAs with deletions of 84 to 97% of the NS1 gene, or of 13 to 63% of the NS3 gene including the entire helicase region, were also complemented in repBHK cells with variable efficiencies. In contrast, KUN RNAs with deletions in any of the other four nonstructural genes NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B were not complemented. We have also demonstrated successfultrans complementation of KUN RNAs containing either combined double deletions in the NS1 and NS5 genes or triple deletions in the NS1, NS3, and NS5 genes comprising as much as 38% of the entire nonstructural coding content. Based on these and our previous complementation results, we have generated a map of cis- and trans-acting elements in RNA replication for the nonstructural coding region of the flavivirus genome. These results are discussed in the context of our model on formation and composition of the flavivirus replication complex, and we suggest molecular mechanisms by which functions of some defective components of the replication complex can be complemented by their wild-type counterparts expressed from another (helper) RNA molecule.

AB  - gammadelta T cells are important for the early control of West Nile virus (WNV) dissemination. Here, we investigated the role of gammadelta T cells in the regulation of CD4(+) T-cell response following a WNV challenge. Splenic dendritic cells (DCs) of WNV-infected gammadelta T-cell-deficient (TCRdelta(-/-)) mice displayed lower levels of CD40, CD80, CD86 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression and interleukin-12 (IL-12) production than those of wild-type mice. Naïve DCs cocultured with WNV-infected gammadelta T cells showed enhanced levels of costimulatory molecules, MHC class II expression and IL-12 production. Further, coculture of CD4(+) T cells from OT II transgenic mice with DCs of WNV-infected TCRdelta(-/-) mice induced less interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-2 production than with those of wild-type controls. Viral antigens were detected in WNV-infected gammadelta T cells.WNV infection or toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist treatment of gammadelta T cells induced the production of IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6, which are known to promote DC maturation. Nevertheless, the levels of TLRs 2, 3, 4 and 7 expression of WNV-infected gammadelta T cells were not different from those of noninfected cells. Overall, these data suggest that WNV-induced gammadelta T-cell activation promotes DC maturation and initiates CD4(+) T-cell priming.

TI  - miR-451a Regulates Neuronal Apoptosis by Modulating 14-3-3ζ-JNK Axis upon Flaviviral Infection
JF  - mSphere
VL  - 7
AB  - Neuronal infection by JEV/WNV culminates into neuronal cell death thus contributing to signs and symptoms exhibited by patients that suffer from and that have recovered from JEV/WNV-induced encephalitis. In the present study we have evaluated the role of miRNA in promoting flavivirus-induced neuronal apoptosis. miR-451a has been demonstrated to promote neuronal cell death by targeting 14-3-3ζ protein function. ABSTRACT Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV)/West Nile Virus (WNV)-induced encephalitis, although observed in selective cases, is associated with fatal consequences ranging from decline in cognitive abilities among recovered patients to coma/death. Loss of neuronal cells following viral infection-induced neuronal death imposes significant challenge to the central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis eventually resulting in loss of CNS tissue integrity and poor disease outcome in patients. In our present study, we aim to evaluate the role played by miRNA in modulating neuronal death upon neurotropic flaviviral infections. Infection of neuronal cell line resulted in upregulation of miR-451a abundance. Upon its upregulation, miR-451a has been demonstrated to target 3′-UTR of 14-3-3ζ transcript culminating into downregulation of 14-3-3ζ at the protein level. In response to 14-3-3ζ protein depletion in the cytosol upon flavivirus infection, increased phosphorylation of JNK protein has been shown to take place thus paving way for the cell to undergo apoptosis. Reversal of virus-induced miR-451a-upregulation helped abrogate neuronal apoptosis which is accompanied by a restoration of 14-3-3ζ protein and phosphorylated-JNK abundance to its normal level. Our findings hence provide a possible therapeutic target for preventing JEV/WNV-induced neuronal apoptosis thus improving disease outcome in flaviviral infection-associated encephalitis. IMPORTANCE Neuronal infection by JEV/WNV culminates into neuronal cell death thus contributing to signs and symptoms exhibited by patients that suffer from and that have recovered from JEV/WNV-induced encephalitis. In the present study we have evaluated the role of miRNA in promoting flavivirus-induced neuronal apoptosis. miR-451a has been demonstrated to promote neuronal cell death by targeting 14-3-3ζ protein function. The function of miR-451a in modulating neuronal physiology toward self-destruction has been shown to be independent of its effect upon the virus infection life cycle. The 14-3-3ζ transcript upon being targeted by miR-451a promotes JNK phosphorylation hence culminating into neuronal death by activation of apoptotic machinery. Inhibition of miR-451a upon neuronal infection by JEV/WNV helped reduce apoptotic machinery activation hence providing us with possible future therapeutic strategy in ameliorating flavivirus-induced neurological manifestations and overall disease burden in terms of morbidity.

AB  - Fusion between purified [3H]uridine-labelled West Nile virus (WNV) particles and liposomes containing RNase, was assayed by degradation of the viral RNA to trichloroacetic acid-soluble material. Fusion of virus with liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin and cholesterol (at a molar ratio of 1:1:1:1.5) was found to be dependent on pH with maximum fusion occurring at pH 6.7 and below. At pH 6.6 fusion was rapid and was essentially complete within 2 min at 37 degrees C. At this time, approximately 50% of the viral RNA had been degraded and increasing the concentration of liposomes or time allowed for fusion increased this percentage only slightly. Fusion was dependent on temperature, was almost totally non-leaky and was not dependent on the presence of divalent cations. The lipid composition of liposomes was found to influence both the pH optimum for fusion and the maximum degree of fusion observed. Electron microscopy was used to visualize the fusion reaction between liposomes and virus particles.

TI  - trans-Complementation Analysis of the Flavivirus Kunjin ns5 Gene Reveals an Essential Role for Translation of Its N-Terminal Half in RNA Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 73
SP  - 9247
EP  - 9255
AB  - ABSTRACT Recently we described rescue of defective Kunjin virus (KUN) RNAs with small deletions in the methyltransferase and RNA polymerase motifs of the ns5 gene, using BHK cells stably expressing KUN replicon RNA (repBHK cells) as helper (A. A. Khromykh et al., J. Virol. 72:7270–7279, 1998). We have now extended our previous observations and report successful trans-complementation of defective KUN RNAs with most of the ns5 gene deleted or substituted with a heterologous (dengue virus) ns5 sequence. Replication of full-length KUN RNAs with 3′-terminal deletions of 136 (5%), 933 (34%), and 1526 (56%) nucleotides in the ns5 gene was complemented efficiently in transfected repBHK cells. RNA with a larger deletion of 2,042 nucleotides (75%) was complemented less efficiently, and RNA with an even larger deletion of 2,279 nucleotides (84%) was not complemented at all. Chimeric KUN genomic RNA containing 87% of the KUN ns5 gene replaced by the corresponding sequence of the dengue virus type 2 ns5 gene was unable to replicate in normal BHK cells but was complemented in repBHK cells. These results demonstrate for the first time complementation of flavivirus RNAs with large deletions (as much as 75%) in the RNA polymerase gene and establish that translation of most of the N-terminal half of NS5 is essential for complementation intrans. A model of formation of the flavivirus replication complex implicating a possible role in RNA replication of conserved coding sequences in the N-terminal half of NS5 is proposed based on the complementation and earlier results with KUN and on reported data with other flaviviruses.

TI  - αVβ3 Integrin Expression Is Essential for Replication of Mosquito and Tick-Borne Flaviviruses in Murine Fibroblast Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - The Flavivirus genus includes a number of important viruses that are pathogenic to humans and animals and are responsible for outbreaks across the globe. Integrins, a family of heterodimeric transmembrane molecules expressed in all nucleated cells mediate critical functions of cell physiology and cell cycle. Integrins were previously postulated to be involved in flavivirus entry and to modulate flavivirus replication efficiency. In the present study, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), lacking the expression of αVβ3 integrin (MEF-αVβ3−/−), were infected with four different flaviviruses, namely yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), Usutu virus (USUV) and Langat virus (LGTV). The effects of the αVβ3 integrin absence in double-knockout MEF-αVβ3−/− on flavivirus binding, internalization and replication were compared to the respective wild-type cells. Binding to the cell surface for all four flaviviruses was not affected by the ablation of αVβ3 integrin, whereas internalization of USUV and WNV was slightly affected by the loss of αVβ3 integrin expression. Most interestingly, the deletion of αVβ3 integrin strongly impaired replication of all flaviviruses with a reduction of up to 99% on virus yields and a strong reduction on flavivirus anti-genome RNA synthesis. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that αVβ3 integrin expression in flavivirus-susceptible cell lines enhances the flavivirus replication.

TI  - γδ T Cells Facilitate Adaptive Immunity against West Nile Virus Infection in Mice1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 177
SP  - 1825
EP  - 1832
AB  - West Nile (WN) virus causes fatal meningoencephalitis in laboratory mice, and γδ T cells are involved in the protective immune response against viral challenge. We have now examined whether γδ T cells contribute to the development of adaptive immune responses that help control WN virus infection. Approximately 15% of TCRδ−/− mice survived primary infection with WN virus compared with 80–85% of the wild-type mice. These mice were more susceptible to secondary challenge with WN virus than the wild-type mice that survived primary challenge with the virus. Depletion of γδ T cells in wild-type mice that survived the primary infection, however, does not affect host susceptibility during secondary challenge with WN virus. Furthermore, γδ T cells do not influence the development of Ab responses during primary and at the early stages of secondary infection with WN virus. Adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells from wild-type mice that survived primary infection with WN virus to naive mice afforded partial protection from lethal infection. In contrast, transfer of CD8+ T cells from TCRδ−/− mice that survived primary challenge with WN virus failed to alter infection in naive mice. This difference in survival correlated with the numeric and functional reduction of CD8 memory T cells in these mice. These data demonstrate that γδ T cells directly link innate and adaptive immunity during WN virus infection.
