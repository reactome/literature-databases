TI  - 2′-O Methylation of Internal Adenosine by Flavivirus NS5 Methyltransferase
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 8
AB  - RNA modification plays an important role in modulating host-pathogen interaction. Flavivirus NS5 protein encodes N-7 and 2′-O methyltransferase activities that are required for the formation of 5′ type I cap (m7GpppAm) of viral RNA genome. Here we reported, for the first time, that flavivirus NS5 has a novel internal RNA methylation activity. Recombinant NS5 proteins of West Nile virus and Dengue virus (serotype 4; DENV-4) specifically methylates polyA, but not polyG, polyC, or polyU, indicating that the methylation occurs at adenosine residue. RNAs with internal adenosines substituted with 2′-O-methyladenosines are not active substrates for internal methylation, whereas RNAs with adenosines substituted with N6-methyladenosines can be efficiently methylated, suggesting that the internal methylation occurs at the 2′-OH position of adenosine. Mass spectroscopic analysis further demonstrated that the internal methylation product is 2′-O-methyladenosine. Importantly, genomic RNA purified from DENV virion contains 2′-O-methyladenosine. The 2′-O methylation of internal adenosine does not require specific RNA sequence since recombinant methyltransferase of DENV-4 can efficiently methylate RNAs spanning different regions of viral genome, host ribosomal RNAs, and polyA. Structure-based mutagenesis results indicate that K61-D146-K181-E217 tetrad of DENV-4 methyltransferase forms the active site of internal methylation activity; in addition, distinct residues within the methyl donor (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) pocket, GTP pocket, and RNA-binding site are critical for the internal methylation activity. Functional analysis using flavivirus replicon and genome-length RNAs showed that internal methylation attenuated viral RNA translation and replication. Polymerase assay revealed that internal 2′-O-methyladenosine reduces the efficiency of RNA elongation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that flavivirus NS5 performs 2′-O methylation of internal adenosine of viral RNA in vivo and host ribosomal RNAs in vitro.

TI  - 3D molecular structure analysis of NS2B/NS3 proteases derived from dengue virus and Zika virus
JF  - Trends in Infection and Global Health
AB  - Both dengue and Zika viruses have infected millions of people worldwide, urging the development of efficacious drugs and vaccines to fight the infection. Unfortunately, current research is yet to elucidate the structural proteomics comparison of the NS2B/NS3 from both viruses. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to comparatively study the structural proteins between dengue and Zika viruses by leveraging standard homology modelling tools. Our data provide 3D molecular structure overviews of NS2B/NS3 derived from the foregoing viruses. Sequence alignment indicated that the viruses share a 56% similarity rate of protein structures. However, in terms of function, both have NS2B that is pivotal for the activation of NS3 proteases.

TI  - A 23bp Indel Polymorphism in TLR2 Gene Enhances Inflammation and Disease Severity in Dengue
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Background Dengue is the most rapidly spreading viral disease transmitted by the bite of infected Aedes mosquitos. Pathogenesis of dengue is still unclear; although host genetic factors, immune responses and virus serotypes have been proposed to contribute to disease severity. The development of high-throughput methods have allowed to scale up capabilities of identifying the key markers of inflammation. Since NS1 protein of dengue virus has been reported to activate immune cells towards enhanced inflammation through TLR2, we examined the role of a polymorphism, a 23bp deletion in 5’UTR region of TLR2 gene in patients with dengue (with and without warning signs) and correlated with plasma levels of inflammatory mediators with disease severity and viral serotypes. Methods Eighty nine patients classified as per WHO 2009 criteria during dengue outbreak in Odisha, India in 2016 were included in the current study. Presence of dengue virus (DENV) was demonstrated by detecting NS1 antigen, IgM capture ELISA and serotypes in circulation were discriminated by type-specific RT-PCR and/or sequencing. Sixty-one confirmed dengue cases were typed for TLR2 indel polymorphism and compared with 485 disease free controls. Plasma samples were assayed for 41-plex cytokine/ chemokines using Luminex bead based immunoassay. Results Presence of 23bp deletion allele of TLR2 gene was significantly more in patients with severe dengue in comparison to dengue fever cases (p= 0.03; Odds ratio 4.05) although the frequency of insertion (Ins) allele of TLR2 was comparable in healthy controls and dengue cases (82.4 and 87.9 % respectively). Seventy-three (82%) samples were found to be positive by NS1/IgM capture ELISA/ RT-PCR. DENV-2 was predominant (58%) during the outbreak. Among the host inflammatory biomarkers 9 molecules were significantly altered in dengue patients when compared to healthy controls. The increased levels of IFN-γ, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-1Rα and MIP-1β correlated significantly with severe dengue. Conclusions The frequency of 23bp Indel mutation of TLR2 was comparable between healthy controls and dengue fever (with and without warning signs), suggesting that this indel mutation does not contribute significantly to susceptibility/ resistance to dengue; however, del allele of TLR2 gene was significantly more associated in patients with severe dengue symptoms when compared to dengue fever cases.

AB  - The mechanisms of RNA replication of plus-strand RNA viruses are still unclear. Here, we identified the first promoter element for RNA synthesis described in a flavivirus. Using dengue virus as a model, we found that the viral RdRp discriminates the viral RNA by specific recognition of a 5' element named SLA. We demonstrated that RNA-RNA interactions between 5' and 3' end sequences of the viral genome enhance dengue virus RNA synthesis only in the presence of an intact SLA. We propose a novel mechanism for minus-strand RNA synthesis in which the viral polymerase binds SLA at the 5' end of the genome and reaches the site of initiation at the 3' end via long-range RNA-RNA interactions. These findings provide an explanation for the strict requirement of dengue virus genome cyclization during viral replication.

AB  - Dengue virus infects primary neurons in mouse experimental model and tissue culture cells of the central nervous system (CNS). In the present work, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line (N1E-115) and a human neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH), susceptible to dengue virus infection were used to study the presence of cell membrane receptor for dengue-2. By day 5 postinfection (pi), viral antigen was detected by immunofluorescence in the cytoplasm and surrounding the nucleus of N1E-115 cells, while on day 7 pi, it was also present along neural extensions. Infection of N1E-115 cells was diminished with trypsin treatment but not with neuraminidase or endoglycosidase H. Partially purified cell membrane proteins from neuroblastoma cells were analyzed by the Virus Overlay Protein Blot Assay (VOPBA), and a single band migrating at 65 kDa was detected in mouse and human neuroblastoma cells but not in C6, a non-susceptible rat glial cell line which was included as a negative control. The 65 kDa protein was eliminated only when nitrocellulose membranes were treated with trypsin. Analysis of neuronal cell infection by dengue virus provides a useful tool to understand the nature of cellular receptors and mechanisms involved in the infection of the nervous system by dengue viruses.

TI  - A CRISPR screen defines a signal peptide processing pathway required by flaviviruses
JF  - Nature
VL  - 535

EP  - 168
AB  - Flaviviruses infect hundreds of millions of people annually, and no antiviral therapy is available. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screen to identify host genes that, when edited, resulted in reduced flavivirus infection. Here, we validated nine human genes required for flavivirus infectivity, and these were associated with endoplasmic reticulum functions including translocation, protein degradation, and N-linked glycosylation. In particular, a subset of endoplasmic reticulum-associated signal peptidase complex (SPCS) proteins was necessary for proper cleavage of the flavivirus structural proteins (prM and E) and secretion of viral particles. Loss of SPCS1 expression resulted in markedly reduced yield of all Flaviviridae family members tested (West Nile, dengue, Zika, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and hepatitis C viruses), but had little impact on alphavirus, bunyavirus, or rhabdovirus infection or the surface expression or secretion of diverse host proteins. We found that SPCS1 dependence could be bypassed by replacing the native prM protein leader sequences with a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen leader sequence. Thus, SPCS1, either directly or indirectly via its interactions with host proteins, preferentially promotes the processing of specific protein cargo, and Flaviviridae have a unique dependence on this signal peptide processing pathway. SPCS1 and other signal processing pathway members could represent pharmacological targets for inhibiting infection by the expanding number of flaviviruses of medical concern.

TI  - A CRISPR screen identifies IFI6 as an ER-resident interferon effector that blocks flavivirus replication
JF  - Nature Microbiology
VL  - 3
SP  - 1214
EP  - 1223
AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an architecturally diverse organelle that serves as a membrane source for the replication of multiple viruses. Flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus and Zika virus, induce unique single-membrane ER invaginations that house the viral replication machinery1. Whether this virus-induced ER remodelling is vulnerable to antiviral pathways is unknown. Here, we show that flavivirus replication at the ER is targeted by the interferon (IFN) response. Through genome-scale CRISPR screening, we uncovered an antiviral mechanism mediated by a functional gene pairing between IFI6 (encoding IFN-α-inducible protein 6), an IFN-stimulated gene cloned over 30 years ago2, and HSPA5, which encodes the ER-resident heat shock protein 70 chaperone BiP. We reveal that IFI6 is an ER-localized integral membrane effector that is stabilized through interactions with BiP. Mechanistically, IFI6 prophylactically protects uninfected cells by preventing the formation of virus-induced ER membrane invaginations. Notably, IFI6 has little effect on other mammalian RNA viruses, including the related Flaviviridae family member hepatitis C virus, which replicates in double-membrane vesicles that protrude outwards from the ER. These findings support a model in which the IFN response is armed with a membrane-targeted effector that discriminately blocks the establishment of virus-specific ER microenvironments that are required for replication. Flavivirus replication at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is targeted by the interferon response through blocking of the formation of virus-induced ER membrane invaginations by the interferon-stimulated gene IFI6, encoding an ER-localized integral membrane effector.

TI  - A Combined Genetic-Proteomic Approach Identifies Residues within Dengue Virus NS4B Critical for Interaction with NS3 and Viral Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 7170
EP  - 7186
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease worldwide. Approved vaccines are not available, and targets suitable for the development of antiviral drugs are lacking. One possible drug target is nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B), because it is absolutely required for virus replication; however, its exact role in the DENV replication cycle is largely unknown. With the aim of mapping NS4B determinants critical for DENV replication, we performed a reverse genetic screening of 33 NS4B mutants in the context of an infectious DENV genome. While the majority of these mutations were lethal, for several of them, we were able to select for second-site pseudoreversions, most often residing in NS4B and restoring replication competence. To identify all viral NS4B interaction partners, we engineered a fully viable DENV genome encoding an affinity-tagged NS4B. Mass spectrometry-based analysis of the NS4B complex isolated from infected cells identified the NS3 protease/helicase as a major interaction partner of NS4B. By combining the genetic complementation map of NS4B with a replication-independent expression system, we identified the NS4B cytosolic loop—more precisely, amino acid residue Q134—as a critical determinant for NS4B-NS3 interaction. An alanine substitution at this site completely abrogated the interaction and DENV RNA replication, and both were restored by pseudoreversions A69S and A137V. This strict correlation between the degree of NS4B-NS3 interaction and DENV replication provides strong evidence that this viral protein complex plays a pivotal role during the DENV replication cycle, hence representing a promising target for novel antiviral strategies. IMPORTANCE With no approved therapy or vaccine against dengue virus infection, the viral nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) represents a possible drug target, because it is indispensable for virus replication. However, little is known about its precise structure and function. Here, we established the first comprehensive genetic interaction map of NS4B, identifying amino acid residues that are essential for virus replication, as well as second-site mutations compensating for their defects. Additionally, we determined the NS4B viral interactome in infected cells and identified the NS3 protease/helicase as a major interaction partner of NS4B. We mapped residues in the cytosolic loop of NS4B as critical determinants for interaction with NS3, as well as RNA replication. The strong correlation between NS3-NS4B interaction and RNA replication provides strong evidence that this complex plays a pivotal role in the viral replication cycle, hence representing a promising antiviral drug target.

AB  - Severe dengue virus (DV) infections can cause the life-threatening condition dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is characterized by a severe plasma leak, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, and, in severe cases, circulatory collapse and death. There is now much evidence that pre-existing immunity to DV can enhance disease when an individual becomes infected on a second or sequential occasion. It has been shown that in contrast to infected dendritic cells (DC), noninfected bystander DC underwent maturation in dengue infection. In this study, we show that TNF-α and type I IFN contribute to the maturation of bystander DC, whereas the inhibition of DV-infected DC maturation can be overcome by activated T cells. Furthermore, IFN-γ-inducible chemokines, CXCL9, 10, and 11 produced by infected DC are greatly amplified in the presence of DV-specific T cells. The chemokine secretion is also enhanced in coculture of HUVEC with either DV-infected DC or activated T cells. Finally, we found a close correlation between the serum level of these three chemokines and disease severity.

AB  - We performed a fragment screen on the dengue virus serotype 3 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase using x-ray crystallography. A screen of 1,400 fragments in pools of eight identified a single hit that bound in a novel pocket in the protein. This pocket is located in the polymerase palm subdomain and conserved across the four serotypes of dengue virus. The compound binds to the polymerase in solution as evidenced by surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry analyses. Related compounds where a phenyl is replaced by a thiophene show higher affinity binding, indicating the potential for rational design. Importantly, inhibition of enzyme activity correlated with the binding affinity, showing that the pocket is functionally important for polymerase activity. This fragment is an excellent starting point for optimization through rational structure-based design.

TI  - A Coupled Mathematical Model of the Intracellular Replication of Dengue Virus and the Host Cell Immune Response to Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) is a positive-strand RNA virus of the Flavivirus genus. It is one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne viruses, infecting globally 390 million individuals per year. The clinical spectrum of DV infection ranges from an asymptomatic course to severe complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), the latter because of severe plasma leakage. Given that the outcome of infection is likely determined by the kinetics of viral replication and the antiviral host cell immune response (HIR) it is of importance to understand the interaction between these two parameters. In this study, we use mathematical modeling to characterize and understand the complex interplay between intracellular DV replication and the host cells' defense mechanisms. We first measured viral RNA, viral protein, and virus particle production in Huh7 cells, which exhibit a notoriously weak intrinsic antiviral response. Based on these measurements, we developed a detailed intracellular DV replication model. We then measured replication in IFN competent A549 cells and used this data to couple the replication model with a model describing IFN activation and production of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), as well as their interplay with DV replication. By comparing the cell line specific DV replication, we found that host factors involved in replication complex formation and virus particle production are crucial for replication efficiency. Regarding possible modes of action of the HIR, our model fits suggest that the HIR mainly affects DV RNA translation initiation, cytosolic DV RNA degradation, and naïve cell infection. We further analyzed the potential of direct acting antiviral drugs targeting different processes of the DV lifecycle in silico and found that targeting RNA synthesis and virus assembly and release are the most promising anti-DV drug targets.

TI  - A Crystal Structure of the Dengue Virus NS5 Protein Reveals a Novel Inter-domain Interface Essential for Protein Flexibility and Virus Replication
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - Flavivirus RNA replication occurs within a replication complex (RC) that assembles on ER membranes and comprises both non-structural (NS) viral proteins and host cofactors. As the largest protein component within the flavivirus RC, NS5 plays key enzymatic roles through its N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) and C-terminal RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains, and constitutes a major target for antivirals. We determined a crystal structure of the full-length NS5 protein from Dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3) at a resolution of 2.3 Å in the presence of bound SAH and GTP. Although the overall molecular shape of NS5 from DENV3 resembles that of NS5 from Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), the relative orientation between the MTase and RdRp domains differs between the two structures, providing direct evidence for the existence of a set of discrete stable molecular conformations that may be required for its function. While the inter-domain region is mostly disordered in NS5 from JEV, the NS5 structure from DENV3 reveals a well-ordered linker region comprising a short 310 helix that may act as a swivel. Solution Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis reveals an increased mobility of the thumb subdomain of RdRp in the context of the full length NS5 protein which correlates well with the analysis of the crystallographic temperature factors. Site-directed mutagenesis targeting the mostly polar interface between the MTase and RdRp domains identified several evolutionarily conserved residues that are important for viral replication, suggesting that inter-domain cross-talk in NS5 regulates virus replication. Collectively, a picture for the molecular origin of NS5 flexibility is emerging with profound implications for flavivirus replication and for the development of therapeutics targeting NS5.

TI  - A Crystal Structure of the Dengue Virus Non-structural Protein 5 (NS5) Polymerase Delineates Interdomain Amino Acid Residues That Enhance Its Thermostability and de Novo Initiation Activities*

EP  - 31114
AB  - Background: The NS5 protein from dengue virus comprises a methyltransferase and a polymerase domain connected by a linker region. Results: Linker residues enhance polymerase activity and thermostability. Conclusion: A crystal structure of the dengue virus polymerase reveals that linker residues contribute to protein stability. Significance: These results should accelerate the development of antivirals against dengue virus, a major human pathogen. The dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 5 (NS5) comprises an N-terminal methyltransferase and a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. Both enzymatic activities form attractive targets for antiviral development. Available crystal structures of NS5 fragments indicate that residues 263–271 (using the DENV serotype 3 numbering) located between the two globular domains of NS5 could be flexible. We observed that the addition of linker residues to the N-terminal end of the DENV RdRp core domain stabilizes DENV1–4 proteins and improves their de novo polymerase initiation activities by enhancing the turnover of the RNA and NTP substrates. Mutation studies of linker residues also indicate their importance for viral replication. We report the structure at 2.6-Å resolution of an RdRp fragment from DENV3 spanning residues 265–900 that has enhanced catalytic properties compared with the RdRp fragment (residues 272–900) reported previously. This new orthorhombic crystal form (space group P21212) comprises two polymerases molecules arranged as a dimer around a non-crystallographic dyad. The enzyme adopts a closed “preinitiation” conformation similar to the one that was captured previously in space group C2221 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The structure reveals that residues 269–271 interact with the RdRp domain and suggests that residues 263–268 of the NS5 protein from DENV3 are the major contributors to the flexibility between its methyltransferase and RdRp domains. Together, these results should inform the screening and development of antiviral inhibitors directed against the DENV RdRp.

TI  - A Dengue Virus Type 2 (DENV-2) NS4B-Interacting Host Factor, SERP1, Reduces DENV-2 Production by Suppressing Viral RNA Replication
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - Host cells infected with dengue virus (DENV) often trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a key process that allows viral reproduction, without killing the host cells until the late stage of the virus life-cycle. However, little is known regarding which DENV viral proteins interact with the ER machinery to support viral replication. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel host factor, stress-associated ER protein 1 (SERP1), which interacts with the DENV type 2 (DENV-2) NS4B protein by several assays, for example, yeast two-hybrid, subcellular localization, NanoBiT complementation, and co-immunoprecipitation. A drastic increase (34.5-fold) in the SERP1 gene expression was observed in the DENV-2-infected or replicon-transfected Huh7.5 cells. The SERP1 overexpression inhibited viral yields (37-fold) in the DENV-2-infected Huh7.5 cells. In contrast, shRNAi-knockdown and the knockout of SERP1 increased the viral yields (3.4- and 16-fold, respectively) in DENV-2-infected HEK-293 and Huh7.5 cells, respectively. DENV-2 viral RNA replication was severely reduced in stable SERP1-expressing Huh7.5 cells transfected with DENV-2 replicon plasmids. The overexpression of DENV-2 NS4B alleviated the inhibitory effect of SERP1 on DENV-2 RNA replication. Taking these results together, we hypothesized that SERP1 may serve as an antiviral player during ER stress to restrict DENV-2 infection. Our studies revealed novel anti-DENV drug targets that may facilitate anti-DENV drug discovery.

TI  - A Funneled Conformational Landscape Governs Flavivirus Fusion Peptide Interaction with Lipid Membranes.
JF  - Journal of chemical theory and computation
VL  - 14 7
SP  - 3920
EP  - 3932
AB  - During host cell infection by flaviviruses such as dengue and Zika, acidic pH within the endosome triggers a conformational change in the envelope protein on the outer surface of the virion. This results in exposure of the ∼15 residue fusion peptide (FP) region, freeing it to induce fusion between the viral and endosomal membranes. A better understanding of the conformational dynamics of the FP in the presence of membranes, and the basis for its selectivity for anionic lipid species present within the endosome, would facilitate its therapeutic targeting with antiviral drugs and antibodies. In this work, multiscale modeling, simulations, and free energy calculations (including a total of ∼75 μs of atomic-resolution sampling), combined with imaging total internal reflection fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments, were employed to investigate the mechanisms of interaction of FP variants with lipid bilayers. Wild-type FPs (in the presence or absence of a fluorescein isothiocyanate tag) were shown to possess a funneled conformational landscape governing their exit from solvent and penetration into the lipid phase and to exhibit an electrostatically favored >2-fold affinity for membranes containing anionic species over purely zwitterionic ones. Conversely, the landscape was abolished in a nonfunctional point mutant, leading to a 2-fold drop in host membrane affinity. Collectively, our data reveal how the highly conserved flavivirus FP has evolved to funnel its conformational space toward a maximally fusogenic state anchored within the endosomal membrane. Therapeutically targeting the accessible ensemble of FP conformations may represent a new, rational strategy for blocking viral infection.

TI  - A Genome-Wide CRISPR-Cas9 Screen Identifies the Dolichol-Phosphate Mannose Synthase Complex as a Host Dependency Factor for Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - Dengue disease, which is caused by dengue virus (DENV), has emerged as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in humans and is a major global health concern. DENV encodes only few proteins and relies on the host cell machinery to accomplish its life cycle. The identification of the host factors important for DENV infection is needed to propose new targets for antiviral intervention. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identified DPM1 and -3, two subunits of the DPMS complex, as important host factors for the replication of DENV as well as other related viruses such as Zika virus. We established that DPMS complex plays dual roles during viral infection, both regulating viral RNA replication and promoting viral structural glycoprotein folding/stability. These results provide insights into the host molecules exploited by DENV and other flaviviruses to facilitate their life cycle. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for dengue disease, a major human health concern for which no specific therapies are available. Like other viruses, DENV relies heavily on the host cellular machinery for productive infection. In this study, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen using haploid HAP1 cells to identify host genes important for DENV infection. We identified DPM1 and -3, two subunits of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident dolichol-phosphate mannose synthase (DPMS) complex, as host dependency factors for DENV and other related flaviviruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV). The DPMS complex catalyzes the synthesis of dolichol-phosphate mannose (DPM), which serves as mannosyl donor in pathways leading to N-glycosylation, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis, and C- or O-mannosylation of proteins in the ER lumen. Mutation in the DXD motif of DPM1, which is essential for its catalytic activity, abolished DPMS-mediated DENV infection. Similarly, genetic ablation of ALG3, a mannosyltransferase that transfers mannose to lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO), rendered cells poorly susceptible to DENV. We also established that in cells deficient for DPMS activity, viral RNA amplification is hampered and truncated oligosaccharides are transferred to the viral prM and E glycoproteins, affecting their proper folding. Overall, our study provides new insights into the host-dependent mechanisms of DENV infection and supports current therapeutic approaches using glycosylation inhibitors to treat DENV infection. IMPORTANCE Dengue disease, which is caused by dengue virus (DENV), has emerged as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in humans and is a major global health concern.

TI  - A Genome-Wide RNAi Screen Reveals Common Host-Virus Gene Signatures: Implication for Dengue Antiviral Drug Discovery.
JF  - GEN biotechnology

AB  - Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease that in recent years has become a major international public health concern. Dengue is a tropical neglected disease with increasing global incidences, affecting millions of people worldwide, and without the availability of specific treatments to combat it. The identification of host-target genes essential for the virus life cycle, for which effective modulators may already exist, would provide an alternative path to a rapid drug development of the much needed antidengue agents. For this purpose, we performed the first genome-wide RNAi screen, combining two high-content readouts for dengue virus infection (DENV E infection intensity) and host cell toxicity (host cell stained nuclei), against an arrayed lentiviral-based short hairpin RNA library covering 16,000 genes with a redundancy of at least 5 hairpins per gene. The screen identified 1924 gene candidates in total; of which, 1730 gene candidates abrogated dengue infection, whereas 194 gene candidates were found to enhance its infectivity in HEK293 cells. A first pass clustering analysis of hits revealed a well-orchestrated gene-network dependency on host cell homeostasis and physiology triggering distinct cellular pathways for infectivity, replication, trafficking, and egress; a second analysis revealed a comprehensive gene signature of 331 genes common to hits identified in 28 published RNAi host-viral interaction screens. Taken together, our findings provide novel antiviral molecular targets with the potential for drug discovery and development.

TI  - A Laboratory-Adapted and a Clinical Isolate of Dengue Virus Serotype 4 Differently Impact Aedes aegypti Life-History Traits Relevant to Vectorial Capacity
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dengue virus cases are on the rise globally, and strategies to reduce new infections by controlling its primary vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, represent a promising biotechnological approach. However, the interaction between virus serotypes and genotypes with Aedes aegypti is poorly characterized at the molecular level, as well as in terms of life-history traits related to vector capacity and mosquito disease tolerance. Here, we infected Aedes aegypti with two philogenetically distant strains of Dengue virus serotype 4 genotype II: a laboratory-adapted strain, DENV4 - TVP/360, and a recent clinical strain isolated from southern Brazil, DENV4 - LRV 13/422. These strains, which exhibit 26 amino acid differences in their sequences, have been shown in to produce distinct immune phenotypes in vertebrate cells. Here, we assessed various life-history traits of Aedes aegypti, including mortality, fecundity, fertility, and induced flight capacity, as well as vector competence-related parameters such as infection intensity and prevalence, following exposure to different viral concentrations. We found that each viral strain differentially affected mosquito traits. While neither strain significantly reduced mosquito lifespan, Aedes aegypti infection prevalence was influenced by the initial dose of DENV4 - TVP/360. This laboratory-adapted strain also enhanced mosquito induced-flight capacity at early (24 hours post-infection - DPI) and late (21 DPI) time points. On the other hand, the recent clinical isolate, DENV4 - LRV 13/422, specifically reduced Aedes aegypti fertility. A better understanding of how different arbovirus strains influence mosquito life-history traits connected to disease spread will be critical in public health efforts to mitigate arbovirus outbreaks that are focused on the mosquito vector. 2 Highlights - The DENV4 strains TVP/360 and LRV 13/422 have 26 amino acid differences in their sequences. - Aedes aegypti infection prevalence is influenced by the initial dose of DENV4 - TVP/360 strain but not DENV4 - LRV 13/422. - Fertility is specifically reduced by DENV4 - LRV 13/422. - Induced-flight activity is enhanced at 1 and 21 days post-infection with DENV4 - TVP/360 strain.

TI  - A Lethal Murine Infection Model for Dengue Virus 3 in AG129 Mice Deficient in Type I and II Interferon Receptors Leads to Systemic Disease
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 1254
EP  - 1266
AB  - ABSTRACT The mosquito-borne disease dengue (DEN) is caused by four serologically and genetically related viruses, termed DENV-1 to DENV-4. Infection with one DENV usually leads to acute illness and results in lifelong homotypic immunity, but individuals remain susceptible to infection by the other three DENVs. The lack of a small-animal model that mimics systemic DEN disease without neurovirulence has been an obstacle, but DENV-2 models that resemble human disease have been recently developed in AG129 mice (deficient in interferon alpha/beta and interferon gamma receptor signaling). However, comparable DENV-1, -3, and -4 models have not been developed. We utilized a non-mouse-adapted DENV-3 Thai human isolate to develop a lethal infection model in AG129 mice. Intraperitoneal inoculation of six to eight-week-old animals with strain C0360/94 led to rapid, fatal disease. Lethal C0360/94 infection resulted in physical signs of illness, high viral loads in the spleen, liver, and large intestine, histological changes in the liver and spleen tissues, and increased serum cytokine levels. Importantly, the animals developed vascular leakage, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. Overall, we have developed a lethal DENV-3 murine infection model, with no evidence of neurotropic disease based on a non-mouse-adapted human isolate, which can be used to investigate DEN pathogenesis and to evaluate candidate vaccines and antivirals. This suggests that murine models utilizing non-mouse-adapted isolates can be obtained for all four DENVs. IMPORTANCE Dengue (DEN) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by four DENV serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4) that have no treatments or vaccines. Primary infection with one DENV usually leads to acute illness followed by lifelong homotypic immunity, but susceptibility to infection by the other three DENVs remains. Therefore, a vaccine needs to protect from all four DENVs simultaneously. To date a suitable animal model to mimic systemic human illness exists only for DENV-2 in immunocompromised mice using passaged viruses; however, models are still needed for the remaining serotypes. This study describes establishment of a lethal systemic DENV-3 infection model with a human isolate in immunocompromised mice and is the first report of lethal infection by a nonadapted clinical DENV isolate without evidence of neurological disease. Our DENV-3 model provides a relevant platform to test DEN vaccines and antivirals.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 8411
EP  - 8421
AB  - ABSTRACT The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1 to DENV4) cause extensive morbidity and mortality. A major obstacle to studying disease pathogenesis and developing therapies has been the lack of a small-animal model. We previously reported isolation of a DENV2 strain, obtained by passaging a clinical isolate between mosquito cells and mice, that caused severe DENV disease in mice and contained multiple mutations, including many in domain II of the envelope (E) protein. Here, we describe a recombinant virus, differing from the non-mouse-passaged virus by two mutations in the E protein, that induces vascular leakage and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-mediated lethality, while the non-mouse-passaged virus causes paralysis. This recombinant virus has a weaker affinity for heparan sulfate, resulting in an increased serum half-life, higher systemic viral loads, and high levels of TNF-α in the serum of infected mice. These results exemplify the role of the E protein in modulating virion clearance and connect the effect of clearance on the systemic viral loads responsible for severe disease manifestations.

TI  - A Neuron-Specific Antiviral Mechanism Prevents Lethal Flaviviral Infection of Mosquitoes
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - Mosquitoes are natural vectors for many etiologic agents of human viral diseases. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses can persistently infect the mosquito central nervous system without causing dramatic pathology or influencing the mosquito behavior and lifespan. The mechanism by which the mosquito nervous system resists flaviviral infection is still largely unknown. Here we report that an Aedes aegypti homologue of the neural factor Hikaru genki (AaHig) efficiently restricts flavivirus infection of the central nervous system. AaHig was predominantly expressed in the mosquito nervous system and localized to the plasma membrane of neural cells. Functional blockade of AaHig enhanced Dengue virus (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), but not Sindbis virus (SINV), replication in mosquito heads and consequently caused neural apoptosis and a dramatic reduction in the mosquito lifespan. Consistently, delivery of recombinant AaHig to mosquitoes reduced viral infection. Furthermore, the membrane-localized AaHig directly interfaced with a highly conserved motif in the surface envelope proteins of DENV and JEV, and consequently interrupted endocytic viral entry into mosquito cells. Loss of either plasma membrane targeting or virion-binding ability rendered AaHig nonfunctional. Interestingly, Culex pipien pallens Hig also demonstrated a prominent anti-flavivirus activity, suggesting a functionally conserved function for Hig. Our results demonstrate that an evolutionarily conserved antiviral mechanism prevents lethal flaviviral infection of the central nervous system in mosquitoes, and thus may facilitate flaviviral transmission in nature.

TI  - A Novel Role for the Regulatory Nod-Like Receptor NLRP12 in Anti-Dengue Virus Response
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue Virus (DENV) infection can cause severe illness such as highly fatality dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Innate immune activation by Nod-like receptors (NLRs) is a critical part of host defense against viral infection. Here, we revealed a key mechanism of NLRP12-mediated regulation in DENV infection. Firstly, NLRP12 expression was inhibited in human macrophage following DENV or other flaviviruses (JEV, YFV, ZIKV) infection. Positive regulatory domain 1 (PRDM1) was induced by DENV or poly(I:C) and suppressed NLRP12 expression, which was dependent on TBK-1/IRF3 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Moreover, NLRP12 inhibited DENV and other flaviviruses (JEV, YFV, ZIKV) replication, which relied on the well-conserved nucleotide binding structures of its NACHT domain. Furthermore, NLRP12 could interact with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) dependent on its Walker A and Walker B sites. In addition, NLRP12 enhanced the production of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFITM3, TRAIL and Viperin. Inhibition of HSP90 with 17-DMAG impaired the upregulation of type I IFNs and ISGs induced by NLRP12. Taken together, we demonstrated a novel mechanism that NLRP12 exerted anti-viral properties in DENV and other flaviviruses (JEV, YFV, ZIKV) infection, which brings up a potential target for the treatment of DENV infection.

JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 274
SP  - 33714
EP  - 33722
AB  - Positive strand viral replicases are membrane-bound complexes of viral and host proteins. The mechanism of viral replication and the role of host proteins are not well understood. To understand this mechanism, a viral replicase assay that utilizes extracts from dengue virus-infected mosquito (C6/36) cells and exogenous viral RNA templates is reported in this study. The 5′- and 3′-terminal regions (TR) of the template RNAs contain the conserved elements including the complementary (cyclization) motifs and stem-loop structures. RNA synthesis in vitro requires both 5′- and 3′-TR present in the same template molecule or when the 5′-TR RNA was added in trans to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) RNA. However, the 3′-UTR RNA alone is not active. RNA synthesis occurs by elongation of the 3′-end of the template RNA to yield predominantly a double-stranded hairpin-like RNA product, twice the size of the template RNA. These results suggest that an interaction between 5′- and 3′-TR of the viral RNA that modulates the 3′-UTR RNA structure is required for RNA synthesis by the viral replicase. The complementary cyclization motifs of the viral genome also seem to play an important role in this interaction.

TI  - A Physical Interaction Network of Dengue Virus and Human Proteins*
JF  - Molecular & Cellular Proteomics
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), an emerging mosquito-transmitted pathogen capable of causing severe disease in humans, interacts with host cell factors to create a more favorable environment for replication. However, few interactions between DENV and human proteins have been reported to date. To identify DENV-human protein interactions, we used high-throughput yeast two-hybrid assays to screen the 10 DENV proteins against a human liver activation domain library. From 45 DNA-binding domain clones containing either full-length viral genes or partially overlapping gene fragments, we identified 139 interactions between DENV and human proteins, the vast majority of which are novel. These interactions involved 105 human proteins, including six previously implicated in DENV infection and 45 linked to the replication of other viruses. Human proteins with functions related to the complement and coagulation cascade, the centrosome, and the cytoskeleton were enriched among the DENV interaction partners. To determine if the cellular proteins were required for DENV infection, we used small interfering RNAs to inhibit their expression. Six of 12 proteins targeted (CALR, DDX3X, ERC1, GOLGA2, TRIP11, and UBE2I) caused a significant decrease in the replication of a DENV replicon. We further showed that calreticulin colocalized with viral dsRNA and with the viral NS3 and NS5 proteins in DENV-infected cells, consistent with a direct role for calreticulin in DENV replication. Human proteins that interacted with DENV had significantly higher average degree and betweenness than expected by chance, which provides additional support for the hypothesis that viruses preferentially target cellular proteins that occupy central position in the human protein interaction network. This study provides a valuable starting point for additional investigations into the roles of human proteins in DENV infection.

TI  - A Population of CD4+CD8+ Double-Positive T Cells Associated with Risk of Plasma Leakage in Dengue Viral Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - According to the WHO 2009 classification, dengue with warning signs is at the risk of developing severe form of dengue disease. One of the most important warning signs is plasma leakage, which can be a serious complication associated with higher morbidity and mortality. We report that the frequency of CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) T cells is significantly increased in patients at risk of developing plasma leakage. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that CD4+CD8+ DP cells were distinct from CD4+ Single Positive (SP) T cells but co-clustered with CD8+ SP cells, indicating a largely similar transcriptional profile. Twenty significant differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified between CD4+CD8+ DP and CD8+ SP cells. These genes encode OX40 and CCR4 proteins as well as other molecules associated with cell signaling on the cell surface (NT5E, MXRA8, and PTPRK). While comparing the profile of gene expression in CD4+CD8+ DP cells from patients with and without warning signs of plasma leakage, similar expression profile was observed, implying a role of CD4+CD8+ DP cells in plasma leakage through a quantitative increase rather than functional alteration. This study provided novel insight into the host immune response during the acute febrile phase of DENV infection and the role of CD4+CD8+ DP T cells in the pathogenesis of plasma leakage.

TI  - A Proline-Rich N-Terminal Region of the Dengue Virus NS3 Is Crucial for Infectious Particle Production
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 5451
EP  - 5461
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus is currently the most important insect-borne viral human pathogen. Viral nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) is a key component of the viral replication machinery that performs multiple functions during viral replication and participates in antiviral evasion. Using dengue virus infectious clones and reporter systems to dissect each step of the viral life cycle, we examined the requirements of different domains of NS3 on viral particle assembly. A thorough site-directed mutagenesis study based on solvent-accessible surface areas of NS3 revealed that, in addition to being essential for RNA replication, different domains of dengue virus NS3 are critically required for production of infectious viral particles. Unexpectedly, point mutations in the protease, interdomain linker, or helicase domain were sufficient to abolish infectious particle formation without affecting translation, polyprotein processing, or RNA replication. In particular, we identified a novel proline-rich N-terminal unstructured region of NS3 that contains several amino acid residues involved in infectious particle formation. We also showed a new role for the interdomain linker of NS3 in virion assembly. In conclusion, we present a comprehensive genetic map of novel NS3 determinants for viral particle assembly. Importantly, our results provide evidence of a central role of NS3 in the coordination of both dengue virus RNA replication and particle formation. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus is an important human pathogen, and its prominence is expanding globally; however, basic aspects of its biology are still unclear, hindering the development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic treatments. Little is known about the initial steps of dengue and other flavivirus particle assembly. This process involves a complex interplay between viral and cellular components, making it an attractive antiviral target. Unpredictably, we identified spatially separated regions of the large NS3 viral protein as determinants for dengue virus particle assembly. NS3 is a multifunctional enzyme that participates in different steps of the viral life cycle. Using reporter systems to dissect different viral processes, we identified a novel N-terminal unstructured region of the NS3 protein as crucial for production of viral particles. Based on our findings, we propose new ideas that include NS3 as a possible scaffold for the viral assembly process.

TI  - A Protective Role for Dengue Virus-Specific CD8+ T Cells 1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 182
SP  - 4865
EP  - 4873
AB  - Infection with one of the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1–4) can result in a range of clinical manifestations in humans, from dengue fever to the more serious dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Although T cells have been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of secondary infections with heterologous DENV serotypes, the role of T cells in protection against DENV is unknown. In this study, we used a mouse-passaged DENV2 strain, S221, to investigate the role of CD8+ T cells in the immune response to primary DENV infection. S221 did not replicate well in wild-type mice, but did induce a CD8+ T cell response, whereas viral replication and a robust CD8+ T cell response were observed after infection of IFN-α/βR−/− mice. Depletion of CD8+ T cells from IFN-α/βR−/− mice before infection resulted in significantly higher viral loads compared with undepleted mice. Mapping the specificity of the CD8+ T cell response led to the identification of 12 epitopes derived from 6 of the 10 DENV proteins, with a similar immunodominance hierarchy observed in wild-type and IFN-α/βR−/− mice. DENV-specific CD8+ T cells produced IFN-γ, TNF-α, expressed cell surface CD107a, and exhibited cytotoxic activity in vivo. Finally, immunization with four of the immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitopes enhanced viral clearance. Collectively, our results reveal an important role for CD8+ T cells in the host defense against DENV and demonstrate that the anti-DENV CD8+ T cell response can be enhanced by immunization, providing rationale for designing DENV-specific vaccines that induce cell-mediated immunity.

TI  - A Review of NS Protein Roles in Dengue Virus Transmission and their Inhibitory Factors
JF  - International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR)
AB  - The Dengue virus is an RNA virus which lacks an effective vaccine. Its transmission is due to the virion’s 3 structural and 7 nonstructural proteins. The nonstructural proteins each play a specific role in impacting the interferon mediated viral defense system, viral replication, initial viral delivery, and host body symptoms. By inhibiting these proteins, we can prevent viral replication within the host cell through the Dengue virion. The review highlights the protein functions to provide a clear scope for researchers to build vaccination trials off of, especially the protein specifics instead of a broad perspective, and develop questions for virus inhibition.

TI  - A Review on Dengue Vaccine Development
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) has become a global health threat with about half of the world’s population at risk of infection. Although the disease caused by DENV is self-limiting in the first infection, the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect increases the mortality in the second infection with a heterotypic virus. Since there is no specific efficient medicine in treatment, it is urgent to develop vaccines to prevent infection and disease progression. Currently, only a live attenuated vaccine, chimeric yellow fever 17D—tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV), has been licensed for clinical use in some countries, and many candidate vaccines are still under research and development. This review discusses the progress, strengths, and weaknesses of the five types of vaccines including live attenuated vaccine, inactivated virus vaccine, recombinant subunit vaccine, viral vectored vaccine, and DNA vaccine.

TI  - A Review on the Progress and Prospects of Dengue Drug Discovery Targeting NS5 RNA- Dependent RNA Polymerase.
JF  - Current pharmaceutical design
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection threatens the health and wellbeing of almost 100 million people in the world. Vectored by mosquitoes, DENV may cause severe disease in human hosts called Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/Dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which are not preventable by any known drug. In the absence of a universally-accepted vaccine, a drug capable of inhibiting DENV multiplication is an urgent and unmet clinical need. Here we summarize inhibitory strategies by targeting either host biochemical pathways or virus-encoded proteins. A variety of approaches have been generated to design Directly-acting antivirals or DAAs targeting different DENV proteins, with mixed success. Among them, DAAs targeting genome replicating viral enzymes have proven effective against many viruses including, Human Immuno-deficiency Virus and Hepatitis C Virus. DAAs may be derived either from existing compound libraries of novel molecules and plant secondary metabolites or devised through Computeraided Drug design (CADD) methods. Here, we focus on compounds with reported DAA-activity against the DENV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which replicates the viral RNA genome. The structure-activity relation (SAR) and toxicity of the natural compounds, including secondary plant metabolites, have been discussed in detail. We have also tabulated the novel compounds with known anti-RdRp activity. We conclude with a list of DAAs for which a co-crystal structure with RdRp is reported. Promising hit compounds are often discarded due to poor selectivity or unsuitable pharmacokinetics. We hope this review will provide a useful reference for further studies into the development of an anti-DENV drug.

TI  - A Review: Aedes-Borne Arboviral Infections, Controls and Wolbachia-Based Strategies
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 9
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses (Arboviruses) continue to generate significant health and economic burdens for people living in endemic regions. Of these viruses, some of the most important (e.g., dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever virus), are transmitted mainly by Aedes mosquitoes. Over the years, viral infection control has targeted vector population reduction and inhibition of arboviral replication and transmission. This control includes the vector control methods which are classified into chemical, environmental, and biological methods. Some of these control methods may be largely experimental (both field and laboratory investigations) or widely practised. Perceptively, one of the biological methods of vector control, in particular, Wolbachia-based control, shows a promising control strategy for eradicating Aedes-borne arboviruses. This can either be through the artificial introduction of Wolbachia, a naturally present bacterium that impedes viral growth in mosquitoes into heterologous Aedes aegypti mosquito vectors (vectors that are not natural hosts of Wolbachia) thereby limiting arboviral transmission or via Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which naturally harbour Wolbachia infection. These strategies are potentially undermined by the tendency of mosquitoes to lose Wolbachia infection in unfavourable weather conditions (e.g., high temperature) and the inhibitory competitive dynamics among co-circulating Wolbachia strains. The main objective of this review was to critically appraise published articles on vector control strategies and specifically highlight the use of Wolbachia-based control to suppress vector population growth or disrupt viral transmission. We retrieved studies on the control strategies for arboviral transmissions via arthropod vectors and discussed the use of Wolbachia control strategies for eradicating arboviral diseases to identify literature gaps that will be instrumental in developing models to estimate the impact of these control strategies and, in essence, the use of different Wolbachia strains and features.

TI  - A Re‐evaluation of the Mechanisms Leading to Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever
JF  - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
VL  - 1171
AB  - Viremia is one of the features of dengue virus infection among the flaviviruses. Dengue virus infection results in a spectrum of clinical symptoms, ranging from undifferentiated flu‐like illness, mild dengue fever, to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS), a life‐threatening illness. Several mechanisms have been hypothesized based primarily on data collected from post‐acute clinical phase to account for DHF/DSS. Lack of a suitable animal model for DHF/DSS has hindered progress in defining the etiology of DHF/DSS. Levels of circulating dengue virus have been well‐correlated to severe dengue disease. However, the cell lineage(s) serving as a primary target for the source of viremia are largely unknown. Results from in vivo and in vitro pilot studies using molecular and more advanced technologies reveal that dengue virus appears to be associated with platelets and the megakaryocytic lineage. The observation may partially explain the dysfunction of platelets observed in dengue affected patients.

EP  - 437
AB  - We have employed gene-trap insertional mutagenesis to identify candidate genes whose disruption confer phenotypic resistance to lytic infection, in independent studies using 12 distinct viruses and several different cell lines. Analysis of >2,000 virus-resistant clones revealed >1,000 candidate host genes, approximately 20 % of which were disrupted in clones surviving separate infections with 2–6 viruses. Interestingly, there were 83 instances in which the insertional mutagenesis vector disrupted transcripts encoding H/ACA-class and C/D-class small nucleolar RNAs (SNORAs and SNORDs, respectively). Of these, 79 SNORAs and SNORDs reside within introns of 29 genes (predominantly protein-coding), while 4 appear to be independent transcription units. siRNA studies targeting candidate SNORA/Ds provided independent confirmation of their roles in infection when tested against cowpox virus, Dengue Fever virus, influenza A virus, human rhinovirus 16, herpes simplex virus 2, or respiratory syncytial virus. Significantly, eight of the nine SNORA/Ds targeted with siRNAs enhanced cellular resistance to multiple viruses suggesting widespread involvement of SNORA/Ds in virus–host interactions and/or virus-induced cell death.

TI  - A Short N-Terminal Peptide Motif on Flavivirus Nonstructural Protein NS1 Modulates Cellular Targeting and Immune Recognition
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 9516
EP  - 9532
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus NS1 is a versatile nonstructural glycoprotein, with intracellular NS1 functioning as an essential cofactor for viral replication and cell surface and secreted NS1 antagonizing complement activation. Even though NS1 has multiple functions that contribute to virulence, the genetic determinants that regulate the spatial distribution of NS1 in cells among different flaviviruses remain uncharacterized. Here, by creating a panel of West Nile virus-dengue virus (WNV-DENV) NS1 chimeras and site-specific mutants, we identified a novel, short peptide motif immediately C-terminal to the signal sequence cleavage position that regulates its transit time through the endoplasmic reticulum and differentially directs NS1 for secretion or plasma membrane expression. Exchange of two amino acids within this motif reciprocally changed the cellular targeting pattern of DENV or WNV NS1. For WNV, this substitution also modulated infectivity and antibody-induced phagocytosis of infected cells. Analysis of a mutant lacking all three conserved N-linked glycosylation sites revealed an independent requirement of N-linked glycans for secretion but not for plasma membrane expression of WNV NS1. Collectively, our experiments define the requirements for cellular targeting of NS1, with implications for the protective host responses, immune antagonism, and association with the host cell sorting machinery. These studies also suggest a link between the effects of NS1 on viral replication and the levels of secreted or cell surface NS1.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85

EP  - 7787
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue (DEN) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has become an increasing economic and health burden for the tropical and subtropical world. The lack of an appropriate animal model of DEN has greatly impeded the study of its pathogenesis and the development of vaccines/antivirals. We recently reported a DEN virus 2 (DENV-2) strain (D2Y98P) that lethally infects immunocompromised AG129 mice, resulting in organ damage or dysfunction and increased vascular permeability, hallmarks of severe DEN in patients (G. K. Tan et al., PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 4:e672, 2010). Here we report the identification of one critical virulence determinant of strain D2Y98P. By mutagenesis, we showed that a Phe-to-Leu alteration at amino acid position 52 in nonstructural protein NS4B completely abolished the pathogenicity of the D2Y98P virus, as evidenced by a lack of lethality and the absence of histological signs of disease, which correlated with reduced viral titers and intact vascular permeability. Conversely, a Leu-to-Phe alteration at position 52 of NS4B in nonvirulent DENV-2 strain TSV01 led to 80% lethality and increased viremia. The NS4B(Phe52) viruses displayed enhanced RNA synthesis in mammalian cells but not in mosquito cells. The increased viral RNA synthesis was independent of the ability of NS4B to interfere with the host type I interferon response. Overall, our results demonstrate that Phe at position 52 in NS4B confers virulence in mice on two independent DENV-2 strains through enhancement of viral RNA synthesis. In addition to providing further insights into the functional role of NS4B protein, our findings further support a direct relationship between viral loads and DEN pathogenesis in vivo, consistent with observations in DEN patients.

TI  - A T164S mutation in the dengue virus NS1 protein is associated with greater disease severity in mice
JF  - Science Translational Medicine
VL  - 11
AB  - The T164S mutation in the NS1 protein of dengue virus increases disease severity in mice through complement activation. Molecular insights into dengue virus NS1 Several hundred thousand cases of severe dengue disease occur annually worldwide. Using phylogenetic analysis of publicly available dengue virus sequences, Chan et al. now show that the T164S mutation in the dengue virus NS1 protein correlated with severe dengue epidemics in the Americas. The investigators reverse engineered this mutation into the NS1 protein of a dengue virus serotype 2 mildly infectious strain. The resulting T164S mutant dengue virus produced more secreted NS1 than wild-type virus in infected mammalian cell lines, mosquitoes, and mice. Gene expression analysis and direct measurement of factors promoting disease severity in mice revealed an association between the T164S mutation in NS1 and its lipoprotein structure. Dengue viruses cause severe and sudden human epidemics worldwide. The secreted form of the nonstructural protein 1 (sNS1) of dengue virus causes vascular leakage, a hallmark of severe dengue disease. Here, we reverse engineered the T164S mutation of NS1, associated with the severity of dengue epidemics in the Americas, into a dengue virus serotype 2 mildly infectious strain. The T164S mutant virus decreased infectious virus production and increased sNS1 production in mammalian cell lines and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) without affecting viral RNA replication. Gene expression profiling of 268 inflammation-associated human genes revealed up-regulation of genes induced in response to vascular leakage. Infection of the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti with the T164S mutant virus resulted in increased viral load in the mosquito midgut and higher sNS1 production compared to wild-type virus infection. Infection of type 1 and 2 interferon receptor–deficient AG129 mice with the T164S mutant virus resulted in severe disease coupled with increased complement activation, tissue inflammation, and more rapid mortality compared to AG129 mice infected with wild-type virus. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that mutant sNS1 formed stable dimers similar to the wild-type protein, whereas the hexameric mutant sNS1 was predicted to be unstable. Immunoaffinity-purified sNS1 from T164S mutant virus–infected mammalian cells was associated with different lipid classes compared to wild-type sNS1. Treatment of human PBMCs with sNS1 purified from T164S mutant virus resulted in a twofold higher production of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting a mechanism for how mutant sNS1 may cause more severe dengue disease.

TI  - A Thioester-Containing Protein Controls Dengue Virus Infection in Aedes aegypti Through Modulating Immune Response
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - Complement-like proteins in arthropods defend against invading pathogens in the early phases of infection. Thioester-containing proteins (TEPs), which exhibit high similarity to mammalian complement C3, are thought to play a key role in the innate immunity of arthropods. We identified and characterized anti-dengue virus (DENV) host factors, in particular complement-like proteins, in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Our results indicate that TEP1 limits DENV infection in Ae. aegypti. We showed that TEP1 transcription is highly induced in mosquitoes following DENV infection. Silencing TEP1 resulted in the up-regulation of viral RNA and proteins. In addition, the production of infectious virus particles increased in the absence of TEP1. We generated a transgenic mosquito line with a TEP1 loss-of-function phenotype under a blood meal-inducible promoter. We showed that viral protein and titers increased in transgenic mosquitoes after an infectious blood meal. Interestingly, expression of transcription factor Rel2 and certain anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) were inhibited in transgenic mosquitoes. Overall, our results suggest that TEP1 regulates the immune response and consequently controls the replication of dengue virus in mosquitoes. This finding provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms of mosquito host factors in the regulation of DENV replication.

TI  - A View of Platelets in Dengue
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - Platelets were mainly associated with coagulation and hemostasis; however, other biological effects have been attributed to platelets, including angiogenesis, extracellular matrix synthesis, inflammation, and immune response. Dengue virus infection causes 200 million cases of severe flu-like illness annually, escalating to life-threatening hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome. Some hypotheses are postulated for immunopathogenesis of dengue, including antibody enhancement theory, T-cell activation of cross-reactive memory, and original antigenic sin. All hypotheses, to some extent, induce an overproduction or a skewed profile of cytokine release, giving rise to the term cytokine storm/cytokine tsunami. Although thrombocytopenia is typical of both mild and severe diseases, the mechanism triggering platelet reduction is incompletely understood. In dengue, platelets are one of the major cell populations affected by direct and/or indirect mechanisms of infection. It is common to observe both thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction in dengue, both strongly related to the clinical outcome. Thus, platelets are frequently affected in dengue, either for alteration of their own functionality, for “silent transport” of virus, or as an anti-viral immune cell. In this way, we describe some of functional aspects of platelets on dengue, observing circulating mediators, intraplatelet proteins contents, morphology, activation markers, and ability to interact with dengue virus.

TI  - A Virulent Wolbachia Infection Decreases the Viability of the Dengue Vector Aedes aegypti during Periods of Embryonic Quiescence
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 4
AB  - A new approach for dengue control has been proposed that relies on life-shortening strains of the obligate intracellular bacterium Wolbachia pipientis to modify mosquito population age structure and reduce pathogen transmission. Previously we reported the stable transinfection of the major dengue vector Aedes aegypti with a life-shortening Wolbachia strain (wMelPop-CLA) from the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we report a further characterization of the phenotypic effects of this virulent Wolbachia infection on several life-history traits of Ae. aegypti. Minor costs of wMelPop-CLA infection for pre-imaginal survivorship, development and adult size were found. However, we discovered that the wMelPop-CLA infection dramatically decreased the viability of desiccated Ae. aegypti eggs over time. Similarly, the reproductive fitness of wMelPop-CLA infected Ae. aegypti females declined with age. These results reveal a general pattern associated with wMelPop-CLA induced pathogenesis in this mosquito species, where host fitness costs increase during aging of both immature and adult life-history stages. In addition to influencing the invasion dynamics of this particular Wolbachia strain, we suggest that the negative impact of wMelPop-CLA on embryonic quiescence may have applied utility as a tool to reduce mosquito population size in regions with pronounced dry seasons or in regions that experience cool winters.

TI  - A balance between circular and linear forms of the dengue virus genome is crucial for viral replication.
JF  - RNA
VL  - 16 12
SP  - 2325
EP  - 35
AB  - The plasticity of viral plus strand RNA genomes is fundamental for the multiple functions of these molecules. Local and long-range RNA-RNA interactions provide the scaffold for interacting proteins of the translation, replication, and encapsidation machinery. Using dengue virus as a model, we investigated the relevance of the interplay between two alternative conformations of the viral genome during replication. Flaviviruses require long-range RNA-RNA interactions and genome cyclization for RNA synthesis. Here, we define a sequence present in the viral 3'UTR that overlaps two mutually exclusive structures. This sequence can form an extended duplex by long-range 5'-3' interactions in the circular conformation of the RNA or fold locally into a small hairpin (sHP) in the linear form of the genome. A mutational analysis of the sHP structure revealed an absolute requirement of this element for viral viability, suggesting the need of a linear conformation of the genome. Viral RNA replication showed high vulnerability to changes that alter the balance between circular and linear forms of the RNA. Mutations that shift the equilibrium toward the circular or the linear conformation of the genome spontaneously revert to sequences with different mutations that tend to restore the relative stability of the two competing structures. We propose a model in which the viral genome exists in at least two alternative conformations and the balance between these two states is critical for infectivity.

TI  - A cocrystal structure of dengue capsid protein in complex of inhibitor
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 117
SP  - 17992
EP  - 18001
AB  - Significance DENV represents the most important mosquito-borne viral pathogen in humans. Although one dengue vaccine has been approved for clinical use, its efficacies against serotypes 1 and 2 remain to be improved. No effective anti-DENV therapy is available for patient treatment. In this study, we solved the cocrystal structure of the DENV-2 capsid protein in complex with an inhibitor that preferentially inhibits serotype 2 (not the other three serotypes) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the compound is incorporated into virions by inducing capsid tetramerization. Such inhibitor-containing virions are defective in nucleocapsid uncoating when infecting new cells. Our results have also uncovered the resistance mechanism and provided a high-resolution structure for rational design of capsid inhibitors with pan-serotype DENV activity. Dengue virus (DENV) was designated as a top 10 public health threat by the World Health Organization in 2019. No clinically approved anti-DENV drug is currently available. Here we report the high-resolution cocrystal structure (1.5 Å) of the DENV-2 capsid protein in complex with an inhibitor that potently suppresses DENV-2 but not other DENV serotypes. The inhibitor induces a “kissing” interaction between two capsid dimers. The inhibitor-bound capsid tetramers are assembled inside virions, resulting in defective uncoating of nucleocapsid when infecting new cells. Resistant DENV-2 emerges through one mutation that abolishes hydrogen bonds in the capsid structure, leading to a loss of compound binding. Structure-based analysis has defined the amino acids responsible for the inhibitor’s inefficacy against other DENV serotypes. The results have uncovered an antiviral mechanism through inhibitor-induced tetramerization of the viral capsid and provided essential structural and functional knowledge for rational design of panserotype DENV capsid inhibitors.

AB  - Abstract Infections caused by viruses as the smallest infectious agents, pose a major threat to global public health. Viral infections utilize different host mechanisms to facilitate their own propagation and pathogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as small noncoding RNA molecules, play important regulatory roles in different diseases, including viral infections. They can promote or inhibit viral infection and have a pro‐viral or antiviral role. Also, viral infections can modulate the expression of host miRNAs. Furthermore, viruses from different families evade the host immune response by producing their own miRNAs called viral miRNAs (v‐miRNAs). Understanding the replication cycle of viruses and their relation with host miRNAs and v‐miRNAs can help to find new treatments against viral infections. In this review, we aim to outline the structure, genome, and replication cycle of various viruses including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, influenza A virus, coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus, human papillomavirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein–Barr virus, Dengue virus, Zika virus, and Ebola virus. We also discuss the role of different host miRNAs and v‐miRNAs and their role in the pathogenesis of these viral infections.

TI  - A comprehensive review of Wolbachia-mediated mechanisms to control dengue virus transmission in Aedes aegypti through innate immune pathways
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 15
AB  - The Dengue virus (DENV), primarily spread by Aedes aegypti and also by Aedes albopictus in some regions, poses significant global health risks. Alternative techniques are urgently needed because the current control mechanisms are insufficient to reduce the transmission of DENV. Introducing Wolbachia pipientis into Ae. aegypti inhibits DENV transmission, however, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Innate immune effector upregulation, the regulation of autophagy, and intracellular competition between Wolbachia and DENV for lipids are among the theories for the mechanism of inhibition. Furthermore, mainly three immune pathways Toll, IMD, and JAK/STAT are involved in the host for the suppression of the virus. These pathways are activated by Wolbachia and DENV in the host and are responsible for the upregulation and downregulation of many genes in mosquitoes, which ultimately reduces the titer of the DENV in the host. The functioning of these immune pathways depends upon the Wolbachia, host, and virus interaction. Here, we summarize the current understanding of DENV recognition by the Ae. aegypti’s immune system, aiming to create a comprehensive picture of our knowledge. Additionally, we investigated how Wolbachia regulates the activation of multiple genes associated with immune priming for the reduction of DENV.

TI  - A conformation-based intra-molecular initiation factor identified in the flavivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - The flaviviruses pose serious threats to human health. Being a natural fusion of a methyltransferase (MTase) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), NS5 is the most conserved flavivirus protein and an important antiviral target. Previously reported NS5 structures represented by those from the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3) exhibit two apparently different global conformations, defining two sets of intra-molecular MTase-RdRP interactions. However, whether these NS5 conformations are conserved in flaviviruses and their specific functions remain elusive. Here we report two forms of DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) NS5 crystal structures representing two conformational states with defined analogies to the JEV-mode and DENV3-mode conformations, respectively, demonstrating the conservation of both conformation modes and providing clues for how different conformational states may be interconnected. Data from in vitro polymerase assays further demonstrate that perturbing the JEV-mode but not the DENV3-mode intra-molecular interactions inhibits catalysis only at initiation, while the cell-based virological analysis suggests that both modes of interactions are important for virus proliferation. Our work highlights the role of MTase as a unique intra-molecular initiation factor specifically only through the JEV-mode conformation, providing an example of conformation-based crosstalk between naturally fused protein functional modules.

TI  - A conformational selection mechanism of flavivirus NS5 for species-specific STAT2 inhibition
JF  - Communications Biology
VL  - 7
AB  - Flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV), rely on their non-structural protein 5 (NS5) for both replication of viral genome and suppression of host IFN signaling. DENV and ZIKV NS5s were shown to facilitate proteosome-mediated protein degradation of human STAT2 (hSTAT2). However, how flavivirus NS5s have evolved for species-specific IFN-suppression remains unclear. Here we report structure-function characterization of the DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) NS5−hSTAT2 complex. The MTase and RdRP domains of DENV2 NS5 form an extended conformation to interact with the coiled-coil and N-terminal domains of hSTAT2, thereby promoting hSTAT2 degradation in cells. Disruption of the extended conformation of DENV2/ZIKV NS5, but not the alternative compact state, impaired their hSTAT2 binding. Our comparative structural analysis of flavivirus NS5s further reveals a conserved protein-interaction platform with subtle amino-acid variations likely underpinning diverse IFN-suppression mechanisms. Together, this study uncovers a conformational selection mechanism underlying species-specific hSTAT2 inhibition by flavivirus NS5.

TI  - A conserved arginine in NS5 binds genomic 3′ stem–loop RNA for primer-independent initiation of flavivirus RNA replication
JF  - RNA
VL  - 28
SP  - 177
EP  - 193
AB  - The commitment to replicate the RNA genome of flaviviruses without a primer involves RNA–protein interactions that have been shown to include the recognition of the stem–loop A (SLA) in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) by the nonstructural protein NS5. We show that DENV2 NS5 arginine 888, located within the carboxy-terminal 18 residues, is completely conserved in all flaviviruses and interacts specifically with the top-loop of 3′SL in the 3′UTR which contains the pentanucleotide 5′-CACAG-3′ previously shown to be critical for flavivirus RNA replication. We present virological and biochemical data showing the importance of this Arg 888 in virus viability and de novo initiation of RNA polymerase activity in vitro. Based on our binding studies, we hypothesize that ternary complex formation of NS5 with 3′SL, followed by dimerization, leads to the formation of the de novo initiation complex that could be regulated by the reversible zipping and unzipping of cis-acting RNA elements.

SP  - 105
EP  - 17
AB  - The mature flavivirus capsid protein (virion C) is commonly thought to be free in the cytoplasm of infected cells and to form a nucleocapsid-like complex with genomic RNA in mature virus particles. There is little sequence conservation among flavivirus virion C proteins, but they are similar in size (e.g., 99 amino acids [aa] for the dengue-4 [DEN4] C) and in bearing a net positive charge. In addition, we noted that C contained a conserved internal hydrophobic segment (spanning aa 45-65 in the DEN4 C). Results of in vivo expression and in vitro translation of wt and mutant forms of the DEN4 virion C demonstrated that the conserved internal hydrophobic segment in the DEN C functioned as a membrane anchor domain. Signal peptide function of this segment was also suggested by its requirement for the entry of C into membranes. Virion C was integrated in membranes in a "hairpin" conformation; positively charged segments amino- and carboxy-terminal to the hydrophobic signal-anchor segment were accessible to protease digestion in the "cytoplasm." The net positive charge in the amino-terminal extramembraneous portion of C (aa 1-44) was one determinant of the hairpin membrane orientation; a conserved positively charged residue within the hydrophobic segment (Arg-54 in the DEN4 C) was not.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 93 Pt 1
SP  - 27
EP  - 38
AB  - Flaviviruses are assembled to bud into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are secreted through the vesicle transport pathway, but the details of the molecular mechanism of virion assembly remain largely unknown. In this study, a highly conserved region in the prM protein was identified among flaviviruses. In the subviral particle (SP) system of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Japanese encephalitis virus, secretion of SPs was impaired by a mutation in the conserved region in the prM protein. Viral proteins were sparse in the Golgi complex and accumulated in the ER. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that long filamentous structures, rather than spherical SPs, were observed in the lumen of the ER as a result of the mutation. The production of infectious virions derived from infectious cDNA of TBEV was also reduced by mutations in the conserved region. Molecular modelling analysis suggested that the conserved region is important for the association of prM-envelope protein heterodimers in the formation of a spike of immature virion. These results are the first demonstration that the conserved region in the prM protein is a molecular determinant for the flavivirus assembly process.

TI  - A cytoplasmic form of EHMT1N methylates viral proteins to enable inclusion body maturation and efficient viral replication
JF  - PLOS Biology
VL  - 22
AB  - Protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) methylate histone and non-histone proteins to regulate biological outcomes such as development and disease including viral infection. While PKMTs have been extensively studied for modulating the antiviral responses via host gene regulation, their role in methylation of proteins encoded by viruses and its impact on host–pathogen interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we discovered distinct nucleo-cytoplasmic form of euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1N/C), a PKMT, that phase separates into viral inclusion bodies (IBs) upon cytoplasmic RNA-virus infection (Sendai Virus). EHMT1N/C interacts with cytoplasmic EHMT2 and methylates SeV-Nucleoprotein upon infection. Elevated nucleoprotein methylation during infection correlated with coalescence of small IBs into large mature platforms for efficient replication. Inhibition of EHMT activity by pharmacological inhibitors or genetic depletion of EHMT1N/C reduced the size of IBs with a concomitant reduction in replication. Additionally, we also found that EHMT1 condensation is not restricted to SeV alone but was also seen upon pathogenic RNA viral infections caused by Chandipura and Dengue virus. Collectively, our work elucidates a new mechanism by which cytoplasmic EHMT1 acts as proviral host factor to regulate host–pathogen interaction.

AB  - Abstract Motivation The Flavivirus genus includes several important pathogens, such as Zika, dengue and yellow fever virus. Flavivirus RNA genomes contain a number of functionally important structures in their 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs). Due to the diversity of sequences and topologies of these structures, their identification is often difficult. In contrast, predictions of such structures are important for understanding of flavivirus replication cycles and development of antiviral strategies. Results We have developed an algorithm for structured pattern search in RNA sequences, including secondary structures, pseudoknots and triple base interactions. Using the data on known conserved flavivirus 3′UTR structures, we constructed structural descriptors which covered the diversity of patterns in these motifs. The descriptors and the search algorithm were used for the construction of a database of flavivirus 3′UTR structures. Validating this approach, we identified a number of domains matching a general pattern of exoribonuclease Xrn1-resistant RNAs in the growing group of insect-specific flaviviruses. Availability and implementation The Leiden Flavivirus RNA Structure Database is available at https://rna.liacs.nl. The search algorithm is available at https://github.com/LeidenRNA/SRHS.

Notwithstanding studies of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) that influence the ability of Aedes aegypti midgut (MG) to become infected with dengue virus (DENV), no study to date has been undertaken to identify genetic markers of vector competence. Furthermore, it is known that mosquito populations differ greatly in their susceptibility to flaviviruses. Differences in vector competence may, at least in part, be due to the presence of specific midgut epithelial receptors and their identification would be a significant step forward in understanding the interaction of the virus with the mosquito. The first interaction of DENV with the insect is through proteins in the apical membrane of the midgut epithelium resulting in binding and receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virus, and this determines cell permissiveness to infection. The susceptibility of mosquitoes to infection may therefore depend on their specific virus receptors. To study this interaction in Ae. aegypti strains that differ in their vector competence for DENV, we investigated the DS3 strain (susceptible to DENV), the IBO-11 strain (refractory to infection) and the membrane escape barrier strain, DMEB, which is infected exclusively in the midgut epithelial cells.Results(1) We determined the MG proteins that bind DENV by an overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA) in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes of the DS3, DMEB and IBO-11 strains. The main protein identified had an apparent molecular weight of 67 kDa, although the protein identified in the IBO-11 strain showed a lower mass (64 kDa). (2) The midgut proteins recognized by DENV were also determined by VOPBA after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. (3) To determine whether the same proteins were identified in all three strains, we obtained polyclonal antibodies against R67 and R64 and tested them against the three strains by immunoblotting; both antibodies recognized the 67 and 64 kDa proteins, corroborating the VOPBA results. (4) Specific antibodies against both proteins were used for immunofluorescent location by confocal microscopy; the antibodies recognized the basal lamina all along the MG, and cell membranes and intercellular spaces from the middle to the end of the posterior midgut (pPMG) in the neighborhood of the hindgut. (5) Quantitative analysis showed more intense fluorescence in DS3 and DMEB than in IBO-11. (6) The viral envelope antigen was not homogeneously distributed during MG infection but correlated with MG density and the distribution of R67/R64.ConclusionIn this paper we provide evidence that the 67 kDa protein (R67/R64), described previously as a DENV receptor, is related to vector competence in Ae. aegypti. Consequently, our results strongly suggest that this protein may be a marker of vector competence for DENV in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.

TI  - A fast-growing dengue virus mutant reveals a dual role of STING in response to infection
JF  - Open Biology
VL  - 12
AB  - The four dengue viruses (DENVs) have evolved multiple mechanisms to ensure its survival. Among these mechanisms is the ability to regulate its replication rate, which may contribute to avoiding premature immune activation that limit infection dissemination: DENVs associated with dengue epidemics have shown slower replication rate than pre-epidemic strains. Correspondingly, wild-type DENVs replicate more slowly than their clinically attenuated derivatives. To understand how DENVs ‘make haste slowly’, we generated and screened for DENV2 mutants with accelerated replication that also induced high type-I interferon (IFN) expression in infected cells. We chanced upon a single NS2B-I114T amino acid substitution, in an otherwise highly conserved amino acid residue. Accelerated DENV2 replication damaged host DNA as mutant infection was dependent on host DNA damage repair factors, namely RAD21, EID3 and NEK5. DNA damage induced cGAS/STING signalling and activated early type-I IFN response that inhibited infection dissemination. Unexpectedly, STING activation also supported mutant DENV replication in infected cells through STING-induced autophagy. Our findings thus show that DENV NS2B has multi-faceted role in controlling DENV replication rate and immune evasion and suggest that the dual role of STING in supporting virus replication within infected cells but inhibiting infection dissemination could be particularly advantageous for live attenuated vaccine development.

TI  - A fluorescence-activatable reporter of flavivirus NS2B–NS3 protease activity enables live imaging of infection in single cells and viral plaques

AB  - The genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae comprises many medically important viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and yellow fever virus. The quest for therapeutic targets to combat flavivirus infections requires a better understanding of the kinetics of virus–host interactions during infections with native viral strains. However, this is precluded by limitations of current cell-based systems for monitoring flavivirus infection in living cells. In the present study, we report the construction of fluorescence-activatable sensors to detect the activities of flavivirus NS2B–NS3 serine proteases in living cells. The system consists of GFP-based reporters that become fluorescent upon cleavage by recombinant DENV-2/ZIKV proteases in vitro. A version of this sensor containing the flavivirus internal NS3 cleavage site linker reported the highest fluorescence activation in stably transduced mammalian cells upon DENV-2/ZIKV infection. Moreover, the onset of fluorescence correlated with viral protease activity. A far-red version of this flavivirus sensor had the best signal-to-noise ratio in a fluorescent Dulbecco's plaque assay, leading to the construction of a multireporter platform combining the flavivirus sensor with reporter dyes for detection of chromatin condensation and cell death, enabling studies of viral plaque formation with single-cell resolution. Finally, the application of this platform enabled the study of cell-population kinetics of infection and cell death by DENV-2, ZIKV, and yellow fever virus. We anticipate that future studies of viral infection kinetics with this reporter system will enable basic investigations of virus–host interactions and facilitate future applications in antiviral drug research to manage flavivirus infections.

AB  - Dengue infection results in a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic, through fever (DF), to the life threatening complications haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and shock syndrome (DSS). Although we now understand that factors such as repeat infections and the type or magnitude of the host response are important in determining severity, the mechanisms of these actions remain largely unknown. Understanding this host-pathogen interaction may enable outcome prediction and new therapy options. Developments in biology now allow a 'systems approach' to be applied to this problem, utilizing whole genomes of both human and virus, in vitro and in vivo to enable a more complete picture of their interplay to be built up. We have developed a chip-based approach to viral sequencing, to increase efficiency and enable large numbers ofgenomes to be completed, together with a web-based interpretation tool. We have also applied human whole genome expression arrays (24000 genes) to characterize the types of host response made to infection and plan to investigate the role of host variation using human whole genome genetic association studies in the future. These technologies have identified novel host pathways involved in viral replication in vitro, and also host immune responses, such as the interferon signalling pathway, that are influenced by viral sequence. This data will be further refined through interlinking with similar data obtained from a large study of dengue patients, initiated in Singapore, that is able to look at the early host response to infection.

TI  - A glance at subgenomic flavivirus RNAs and microRNAs in flavivirus infections
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 13
AB  - The family Flaviviridae comprises a wide variety of viruses that are distributed worldwide, some of which are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. There are neither vaccines nor antivirals for most flavivirus infections, reinforcing the importance of research on different aspects of the viral life cycle. During infection, cytoplasmic accumulation of RNA fragments mainly originating from the 3′ UTRs, which have been designated subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs), has been detected. It has been shown that eukaryotic exoribonucleases are involved in viral sfRNA production. Additionally, viral and human small RNAs (sRNAs) have also been found in flavivirus-infected cells, especially microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs were first described in eukaryotic cells and in a mature and functional state present as single-stranded 18–24 nt RNA fragments. Their main function is the repression of translation through base pairing with cellular mRNAs, besides other functions, such as mRNA degradation. Canonical miRNA biogenesis involves Drosha and Dicer, however miRNA can also be generated by alternative pathways. In the case of flaviviruses, alternative pathways have been suggested. Both sfRNAs and miRNAs are involved in viral infection and host cell response modulation, representing interesting targets of antiviral strategies. In this review, we focus on the generation and function of viral sfRNAs, sRNAs and miRNAs in West Nile, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis and yellow fever infections, as well as their roles in viral replication, translation and cell immune response evasion. We also give an overview regarding other flaviviruses and the generation of cellular miRNAs during infection.

AB  - Dengue virus is an emerging global health threat. Its major envelope glycoprotein, E, mediates viral attachment and entry by membrane fusion. A crystal structure of the soluble ectodomain of E from dengue virus type 2 reveals a hydrophobic pocket lined by residues that influence the pH threshold for fusion. The pocket, which accepts a hydrophobic ligand, opens and closes through a conformational shift in a β-hairpin at the interface between two domains. These features point to a structural pathway for the fusion-activating transition and suggest a strategy for finding small-molecule inhibitors of dengue and other flaviviruses.

TI  - A limited role for autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Macroautophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It can additionally function as an innate immune response to viral infection as has been demonstrated for a number of arthropod-borne (arbo-) viruses. Arboviruses are maintained in a transmission cycle between vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors yet the majority of studies assessing autophagy-arbovirus interactions have been limited to the mammalian host. Therefore we evaluated the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection of the invertebrate vector using the tractable Aag2 Aedes aegypti mosquito cell culture system. Our data demonstrates that autophagy is significantly induced in mosquito cells upon infection with two flaviviruses, dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), as well as an unrelated mosquito-borne virus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV; Togaviridae). While assessing the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection, we observed a somewhat paradoxical outcome. Both induction and suppression of autophagy via torin 1 and spautin-1, respectively, resulted in increased viral titers for all three viruses, yet suppression of autophagy-related genes had no effect. Interestingly, chemical modulators of autophagy had either no effect or opposite effects in another widely used mosquito cell line, C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells. Together, our data reveals a limited role for autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells. Further, our findings suggest that commonly used chemical modulators of autophagy alter mosquito cells in such a way as to promote viral replication; however, it is unclear if this occurs directly through autophagic manipulation or other means. Author Summary Arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses, specifically those transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, cause significant morbidity and mortality and pose a continued public health threat worldwide. Many of these viruses lack vaccines or therapeutics and current mosquito control strategies are underperforming. For these reasons, identifying vulnerabilities within the transmission cycle that can be targeted will be critical to the development of novel control interventions. Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular pathway and previous studies manipulating this pathway have shown promise in minimizing viral infections in mammalian hosts. In this study we examined arbovirus-autophagy interactions within vector mosquitoes. The goal was to elucidate the role of autophagy during infection of mosquitoes in hopes of identifying critical interactions that can be targeted by novel approaches to block infection of and transmission by vector mosquitoes.

TI  - A mosquito salivary protein promotes flavivirus transmission by activation of autophagy
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 11
AB  - Transmission from an infected mosquito to a host is an essential process in the life cycle of mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Numerous studies have demonstrated that mosquito saliva facilitates viral transmission. Here we find that a saliva-specific protein, named Aedes aegypti venom allergen-1 (AaVA-1), promotes dengue and Zika virus transmission by activating autophagy in host immune cells of the monocyte lineage. The AG6 mice (ifnar1–/–ifngr1–/–) bitten by the virus-infected AaVA-1-deficient mosquitoes present a lower viremia and prolonged survival. AaVA-1 intracellularly interacts with a dominant negative binder of Beclin-1, known as leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (LRPPRC), and releases Beclin-1 from LRPPRC-mediated sequestration, thereby enabling the initialization of downstream autophagic signaling. A deficiency in Beclin-1 reduces viral infection in mice and abolishes AaVA-1-mediated enhancement of ZIKV transmission by mosquitoes. Our study provides a mechanistic insight into saliva-aided viral transmission and could offer a potential prophylactic target for reducing flavivirus transmission. Mosquito saliva affects transmission of flaviviruses, but underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, the authors show that Aedes aegypti venom allergen-1 (AaVA-1) promotes dengue and Zika virus transmission by activating autophagy in host immune cells of the monocyte lineage.

TI  - A mosquito salivary protein-driven influx of myeloid cells facilitates flavivirus transmission
JF  - The EMBO Journal
VL  - 43
SP  - 1690
EP  - 1721
AB  - Mosquitoes transmit many disease-relevant flaviviruses. Efficient viral transmission to mammalian hosts requires mosquito salivary factors. However, the specific salivary components facilitating viral transmission and their mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. Here, we show that a female mosquito salivary gland-specific protein, here named A. aegypti Neutrophil Recruitment Protein (AaNRP), facilitates the transmission of Zika and dengue viruses. AaNRP promotes a rapid influx of neutrophils, followed by virus-susceptible myeloid cells toward mosquito bite sites, which facilitates establishment of local infection and systemic dissemination. Mechanistically, AaNRP engages TLR1 and TLR4 of skin-resident macrophages and activates MyD88-dependent NF-κB signaling to induce the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants. Inhibition of MyD88-NF-κB signaling with the dietary phytochemical resveratrol reduces AaNRP-mediated enhancement of flavivirus transmission by mosquitoes. These findings exemplify how salivary components can aid viral transmission, and suggest a potential prophylactic target.

TI  - A naturally isolated symbiotic bacterium suppresses flavivirus transmission by Aedes mosquitoes
JF  - Science
VL  - 384
AB  - The commensal microbiota of the mosquito gut plays a complex role in determining the vector competence for arboviruses. In this study, we identified a bacterium from the gut of field Aedes albopictus mosquitoes named Rosenbergiella sp. YN46 (Rosenbergiella_YN46) that rendered mosquitoes refractory to infection with dengue and Zika viruses. Inoculation of 1.6 × 103 colony forming units (CFUs) of Rosenbergiella_YN46 into A. albopictus mosquitoes effectively prevents viral infection. Mechanistically, this bacterium secretes glucose dehydrogenase (RyGDH), which acidifies the gut lumen of fed mosquitoes, causing irreversible conformational changes in the flavivirus envelope protein that prevent viral entry into cells. In semifield conditions, Rosenbergiella_YN46 exhibits effective transstadial transmission in field mosquitoes, which blocks transmission of dengue virus by newly emerged adult mosquitoes. The prevalence of Rosenbergiella_YN46 is greater in mosquitoes from low-dengue areas (52.9 to ~91.7%) than in those from dengue-endemic regions (0 to ~6.7%). Rosenbergiella_YN46 may offer an effective and safe lead for flavivirus biocontrol. Editor’s summary Flavivirus diseases are increasing in incidence and prevalence owing to the urban proclivities of its Aedes mosquito vector species. Extirpation of mosquitoes is considered key for the control of several human diseases but often involves toxic chemicals that prompt mosquito resistance. As some biocontrol alternatives look promising in malaria campaigns, Zhang et al. examined the microbiota of Aedes mosquitoes for potential agents to control dengue and Zika virus transmission. The authors isolated a bacterium called Rosenbergiella_YN46 in Aedes albopictus mosquitos. The bacterium was fed to caged mosquitoes to establish stable gut infections, and it was found to prevent the insects from being infected by viruses and blocked viral transmission to mice. —Caroline Ash INTRODUCTION Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, cause several potentially fatal human viral infections. Increasing flaviviral transmission and outbreaks have become major public health concerns worldwide. However, safe and effective prophylactics and therapeutics are still lacking. Viral particles are ingested by mosquitoes during blood feeding on wild vertebrates, livestock, and humans. Viruses enter the mosquito gut epithelial cells and infect hemocoel tissues, subsequently migrating to the salivary glands, from which they are transmitted to a human or other vertebrate during the mosquito’s next blood meal. The mosquito gut thus regulates the transmission of viruses acquired in a blood meal. Hence, the interaction between the mosquito gut and viruses is a target for flavivirus control strategies. RATIONALE The rich commensal mosquito microbiota plays intricate roles in determining vector competence for viruses. Thus, the mosquito gut microbiota is considered a key determinant of flavivirus infection and transmission. Because of their hosts’ complex life histories, the wider environment also plays a crucial role in shaping the microbial community structure of adult mosquitoes. Gut bacteria may be acquired by vertical transmission from female mosquitoes to offspring, and they can also be horizontally acquired during feeding of the aquatic mosquito larvae and flying adult stages. Mosquitoes emerging from different habitats may therefore harbor different compositions of gut microbiota, endowing their insect hosts with different traits including vector competence. RESULTS In this study, we isolated 55 cultivable bacteria from the guts of field-caught Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, the primary vector of dengue virus in Yunnan Province, China. Gut colonization by a Rosenbergiella bacterium, named Rosenbergiella_YN46, enables both A. albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to resist DENV and ZIKV infection. Furthermore, Rosenbergiella_YN46 persistently resides in the guts of Aedes mosquitoes. Mechanistically, Rosenbergiella_YN46 inhibits flavivirus infection of the gut epithelium by secreting a glucose dehydrogenase (RyGDH). During blood feeding, RyGDH effectively converts glucose into gluconic acid, rapidly acidifying the lumen of the mosquito gut (pH ≈ 6.0). This acidic environment inactivates flavivirus virions and disables viral invasion into gut epithelial cells. We found that the prevalence of Rosenbergiella_YN46 largely varied among A. albopictus populations from different locations in Yunnan. Mosquitoes from Wenshan and Puer, which report few local dengue cases, were more likely to have Rosenbergiella_YN46 in their guts than were those from dengue-endemic Xishuangbanna and Lincang. Under semifield conditions, Rosenbergiella_YN46 exhibited effective transstadial transmission in field mosquitoes, which blocked the transmission of DENV2 by newly emerged adult mosquitoes. Rosenbergiella bacteria were widely distributed in the floral nectar of insect-pollinated plants and possibly represent a low-impact strategy for DENV control. CONCLUSION The floral nectar–associated gut bacterium Rosenbergiella_YN46 in field A. albopictus mosquitoes from Yunnan Province, China, protects mosquitoes from flavivirus infection by acidifying the insect gut lumen. Rosenbergiella_YN46 is highly prevalent in the guts of mosquitoes in low dengue–incidence locations. It can be transmitted transstadially to A. albopictus under field-like conditions and blocks dengue acquisition by adults, suggesting that this bacterium may be introduced into mosquito populations in dengue-endemic areas to reduce virus transmission. This study shows that the use of Rosenbergiella_YN46–colonized field mosquitoes may offer a feasible biocontrol strategy for reducing flavivirus transmission and prevalence in nature. A naturally occurring bacterium, Rosenbergiella_YN46, blocks flavivirus transmission by Aedes mosquitoes. (I) Rosenbergiella_YN46 inhibits flavivirus infection in Aedes mosquitoes by secreting glucose dehydrogenase, which acidifies the gut lumen and inactivates viral envelope proteins. (II) Field surveillance reveals a greater prevalence of Rosenbergiella_YN46 in areas with low dengue incidence than in dengue-endemic regions. (III) Under semifield conditions, Rosenbergiella_YN46 demonstrates efficient transstadial transmission in field mosquitoes, thereby preventing DENV transmission by newly emerged adult mosquitoes.

TI  - A new subclass of exoribonuclease resistant RNA found in multiple Flaviviridae genera
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Viruses have developed innovative strategies to exploit the cellular machinery and overcome the host antiviral defenses, often using specifically structured RNA elements. Examples are found in flaviviruses; during flaviviral infection, pathogenic subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) accumulate in the cell. These sfRNAs are formed when a host cell 5’ to 3’ exoribonuclease degrades the viral genomic RNA but is blocked by an exoribonuclease resistant RNA structure (xrRNA) located in the viral genome’s 3’untranslated region (UTR). Although known to exist in several Flaviviridae genera the full distribution and diversity of xRNAs in this virus family was unknown. Using the recent high-resolution structure of an xrRNA from the divergent flavivirus Tamana bat virus (TABV) as a reference, we used bioinformatic searches to identify xrRNA in the Pegivirus, Pestivirus, and Hepacivirus genera. We biochemically and structurally characterized several examples, determining that they are genuine xrRNAs with a conserved fold. These new xrRNAs look superficially similar to the previously described xrRNAs but possess structural differences making them distinct from previous classes of xrRNAs. Our findings thus require adjustments of previous xrRNA classification schemes and expand on the previously known distribution of the xrRNA in Flaviviridae, indicating their widespread distribution and illustrating their importance. IMPORTANCE The Flaviviridae comprise one of the largest families of positive sense single stranded (+ssRNA) and it is divided into the Flavivirus, Pestivirus, Pegivirus, and Hepacivirus genera. The genus Flavivirus contains many medically relevant viruses such as Zika Virus, Dengue Virus, and Powassan Virus. In these, a part of the virus’s RNA twists up into a very special three-dimensional shape called an xrRNA that blocks the ability of the cell to “chew up” the viral RNA. Hence, part of the virus’ RNA remains intact, and this protected part is important for viral infection. This was known to occur in Flaviviruses but whether it existed in the other members of the family was not known. In this study, we not only identified a new subclass of xrRNA found in Flavivirus but also in the remaining three genera. The fact that this process of viral RNA maturation exists throughout the entire Flaviviridae family makes it clear that this is an important but underappreciated part of the infection strategy of these diverse human pathogens.

TI  - A non-structural protein 1 substitution of dengue virus enhances viral replication by interfering with the antiviral signaling pathway
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 32
AB  - Background The largest dengue virus 2 (DENV2) outbreak occurred in Taiwan in 2015, resulting in many fatalities. We therefore aim to identify crucial genetic variations which determine the virulence of the 2015 Taiwan outbreak strains. Methods We compared the 2015 Taiwan DENV2 sequences to the pre-2015 sequences. Reverse genetics (rg) viruses with substitutions were produced and the viral growth kinetics were investigated. We treated A549 cells with interferon (IFN) to determine the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression and STAT1 phosphorylation in the rg viral infection and plasmid transfection systems. IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels were measured upon DENV infection using ELISA. Results The rgNS1-K272R mutant showed faster replication in IFN-I producing cells compared to wildtype (WT) virus. Results revealed that NS1-K272R substitution contributed to higher soluble NS1 secretion and evade the antiviral response by suppressing the expression of ISGs and STAT1 phosphorylation compared to NS1-WT. Infection with rgNS1-K272R induced higher secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the activation of canonical nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Conclusions Our results revealed that the DENV NS1 amino acid substitution affects the NS1 ability in immune evasion, which may contribute to the largest dengue outbreak in Taiwan since the 1990s.

TI  - A noncoding RNA produced by arthropod-borne flaviviruses inhibits the cellular exoribonuclease XRN1 and alters host mRNA stability.
JF  - RNA
VL  - 18 11
SP  - 2029
EP  - 40
AB  - All arthropod-borne flaviviruses generate a short noncoding RNA (sfRNA) from the viral 3' untranslated region during infection due to stalling of the cellular 5'-to-3' exonuclease XRN1. We show here that formation of sfRNA also inhibits XRN1 activity. Cells infected with Dengue or Kunjin viruses accumulate uncapped mRNAs, decay intermediates normally targeted by XRN1. XRN1 repression also resulted in the increased overall stability of cellular mRNAs in flavivirus-infected cells. Importantly, a mutant Kunjin virus that cannot form sfRNA but replicates to normal levels failed to affect host mRNA stability or XRN1 activity. Expression of sfRNA in the absence of viral infection demonstrated that sfRNA formation was directly responsible for the stabilization of cellular mRNAs. Finally, numerous cellular mRNAs were differentially expressed in an sfRNA-dependent fashion in a Kunjin virus infection. We conclude that flaviviruses incapacitate XRN1 during infection and dysregulate host mRNA stability as a result of sfRNA formation.

TI  - A novel interaction between dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 and the NS4A-2K-4B precursor is required for viral RNA replication but not for formation of the membranous replication organelle
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 15
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) has emerged as major human pathogen. Despite the serious socio-economic impact of DENV-associated diseases, antiviral therapy is missing. DENV replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells and induces a membranous replication organelle, formed by invaginations of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and designated vesicle packets (VPs). Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of DENV is a multifunctional protein. It is secreted from cells to counteract antiviral immune responses, but also critically contributes to the severe clinical manifestations of dengue. In addition, NS1 is indispensable for viral RNA replication, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we employed a combination of genetic, biochemical and imaging approaches to dissect the determinants in NS1 contributing to its various functions in the viral replication cycle. Several important observations were made. First, we identified a cluster of amino acid residues in the exposed region of the β-ladder domain of NS1 that are essential for NS1 secretion. Second, we revealed a novel interaction of NS1 with the NS4A-2K-4B cleavage intermediate, but not with mature NS4A or NS4B. This interaction is required for RNA replication, with two residues within the connector region of the NS1 “Wing” domain being crucial for binding of the NS4A-2K-4B precursor. By using a polyprotein expression system allowing the formation of VPs in the absence of viral RNA replication, we show that the NS1 –NS4A-2K-4B interaction is not required for VP formation, arguing that the association between these two proteins plays a more direct role in the RNA amplification process. Third, through analysis of polyproteins containing deletions in NS1, and employing a trans-complementation assay, we show that both cis and trans acting elements within NS1 contribute to VP formation, with the capability of NS1 mutants to form VPs correlating with their capability to support RNA replication. In conclusion, these results reveal a direct role of NS1 in VP formation that is independent from RNA replication, and argue for a critical function of a previously unrecognized NS4A-2K-NS4B precursor specifically interacting with NS1 and promoting viral RNA replication.

TI  - A pH-dependent cluster of charges in a conserved cryptic pocket on flaviviral envelopes
JF  - eLife
VL  - 12
AB  - Flaviviruses are enveloped viruses which include numerous human pathogens of escalating global health concern that are predominantly transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks. Some, such as dengue virus, exhibit the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease, making traditional vaccine-based routes of fighting viral infections problematic. The pH-dependent conformational change of the envelope (E) protein required for fusion between the viral and endosomal membranes is an attractive point of inhibition by antivirals as it also has the potential to diminish the effects of ADE. Here, we systematically examined six flaviviruses by employing large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a ∼400,000 atom raft system that represents a substantial portion of the curved flaviviral envelope. We utilised a benzene-mapping approach over a total of 14 μs of sampling time, leading to discovery of shared hotspots and elucidation of the dynamic behaviour of conserved cryptic sites. A cryptic pocket previously shown to bind a detergent molecule exhibited significant strain-specific characteristics. An alternative conserved cryptic site located at the E protein domain interfaces showed a more consistent dynamic behaviour across flaviviruses and contains a buried, conserved cluster of ionisable residues that includes His144, previously implicated in the pH-dependent conformational switch required for fusion. The dynamics of the cluster were further explored in extensive constant-pH simulations and revealed cluster and domain-interface disruption under low pH conditions. Based on this, we propose a cluster-dependent mechanism that addresses inconsistencies in the histidine-switch hypothesis and highlights the role of cluster protonation in orchestrating the domain dissociation pivotal for the formation of the fusogenic trimer.

TI  - A prM mutation that attenuates dengue virus replication in human cells enhances midgut infection in mosquitoes
JF  - Science Translational Medicine
VL  - 16
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENVs), like all viruses, evolve to perpetuate transmission of their species in their hosts. However, how DENV genetics influences dengue disease outbreaks remains poorly understood. Here, we examined isolates of the South Pacific dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) that emerged in the 1970s and caused major dengue outbreaks in islands in this region until it reached Tonga, where only a few mild cases were reported. Phylogenetically, the DENV-2 strain isolated in Tonga segregated into a clade different from those clades infecting populations in other South Pacific islands. We found that this epidemiological observation could be explained by a single histidine-to-arginine substitution in position 86 of the premembrane (prM) protein of the Tonga DENV-2 strain. This mutation attenuated viral protein translation in mammalian cells but not in midgut cells of the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. In mammalian cells, the prM mutation resulted in reduced translation of the viral genome and subsequent reduced virus replication. In contrast, in mosquito midgut cells, the prM mutation conferred a selective infection advantage, possibly because of the positively charged arginine residue introduced by the mutation. These findings provide molecular insights into the year-long silent transmission of attenuated DENV-2 in Tonga during the 1970s dengue outbreak in the South Pacific. Evolution of dengue virus type 2 in Tonga may be explained by a single mutation in a viral gene encoding premembrane protein. Editor’s summary The effects of genetic changes in dengue virus on dengue outbreaks remain unclear. Choi et al. have analyzed the 1970s dengue outbreak in the South Pacific, which began with a large number of severe dengue cases but caused only mild febrile illness once it arrived in Tonga. These investigators report that the attenuated human infection might be explained by a single histidine-to-arginine substitution in position 86 of the premembrane (prM) protein of this dengue virus strain. The authors demonstrate that this mutation conferred a selection advantage enabling the virus to more efficiently infect the midgut of the Aedes mosquito vector. These findings help to integrate dengue virus genetics into our understanding of dengue epidemiology. —Orla Smith

EP  - 84
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infects target cells by attaching to various cell receptors, many of which are still unknown. In C6/36 cells (Aedes albopictus cell line), DENV-4 bound to two glycoproteins of 40 and 45 kDa, located on the cell surface. Preincubation of cells with polyclonal antibody against the 45-kDa protein specifically blocked DENV-4 infection of C6/36 cells. The antibody and purified DENV-4 detected the 45-kDa molecule in total extracts from eggs, larvae, and pupae as well as from the midgut, ovary, and salivary glands from adult-stage Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, whereas in malphigian tubules it was absent. This suggests that the distribution of the 45-kDa protein correlates with tissue tropism of DENV infection in mosquitoes. The 45-kDa molecule was not detected in Anopheles albimanus mosquito. The relevance of our findings is discussed from the pathogenetic and vector competence viewpoints.

TI  - A quantitative luciferase-based cell–cell fusion assay to measure four-serotype dengue virus E protein-triggered membrane fusion
JF  - Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics
VL  - 16
SP  - 2176
EP  - 2182
AB  - ABSTRACT The class II membrane fusion induced by flavivirus E proteins is a unique pH-dependent membrane fusion process differently from the class I or III membrane fusion by other enveloped virus proteins. The fusion peptide on the DII of the flavivirus E proteins can insert into the cell membrane as a cell entry process besides the receptor bindings. A traditional assay using C6/36 mosquito cells infected by dengue viruses has been previously reported but did not provide efficient quantitation to measure the virus-triggered membrane fusion. Here we reported the development of a quantitative cell fusion assay for four serotypes of dengue viruses and the recently emerged Zika viruses. We used a pCI-neo vector encoding the prME genes of dengue and Zika viruses and investigated the cell fusion in transfected 293, Vero and CHO cells. Donor cells were co-transfection of the prME genes of dengue and Zika prME gene and T7 RNA polymerase to react with the indicator cells transfected with the luciferase gene under the control of the T7 promoter. Quantification of the virus-induced cell fusion was determined by the luciferase expression levels under a switch of pH from 7.4 to 5.4 in the co-cultured donor and indicator cells. The quantitative luciferase-based assay was applied to measure the anti-fusion activity by two monoclonal antibodies mAb 4G2 and mAb DB42 against dengue virus infections. This assay could quality as a quantitative bioassay for testing the potency of anti-fusion monoclonal antibodies.

AB  - BackgroundDengue shock syndrome (DSS), a severe life-threatening form of dengue infection, mostly occurs in children. A recent genome wide association study (GWAS) identified two SNPs, rs3132468 of major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence B (MICB) and rs3765524 of phospholipase C, epsilon 1 (PLCE1), associated with DSS in Vietnamese children. In this study, to examine whether an identical association is found in a different population, the association of these two SNPs with DSS was assessed in Thai children with dengue.MethodsThe rs3132468 and rs3765524 SNPs were genotyped in 917 Thai children with dengue: 76 patients with DSS and 841 patients with non-DSS. The allele frequencies were compared between DSS and non-DSS groups by one-sided Fisher’s exact test. The association of rs3132468 and rs3765524 with the mRNA expression levels of MICB and PLCE1 were assessed in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines.ResultsThe reported DSS-risk alleles were significantly associated with DSS in Thai patients with dengue (one-sided P = 0.0213 and odds ratio [OR] = 1.58 for rs3132468-C and one-sided P = 0.0252 and OR = 1.49 for rs3765524-C). The rs3132468-C allele showed a significant association with lower mRNA level of MICB (P = 0.0267), whereas the rs3765524-C allele did not. These results imply that the MICB molecule may play an important role in the prevention of DSS in dengue infection.ConclusionsTogether with previous association studies, we conclude that rs3132468-C at MICB and rs3765524-C at PLCE1 confer risk of DSS in Southeast Asians.

VL  - 90 Pt 5
SP  - 1093
EP  - 103
AB  - We have recently proposed that amphisomes act as a site for translation and replication of dengue virus (DENV)-2 and that DENV-2 entry and replication are linked through an ongoing association with membranes of an endosomal-autophagosomal lineage. In this report, we present the results of an investigation into the interaction between DENV-3 and the autophagy machinery. Critically, treatment with the lysosomal fusion inhibitor l-asparagine differentiated the interaction of DENV-3 from that of DENV-2. Inhibition of fusion of autophagosomes and amphisomes with lysosomes resulted in decreased DENV-3 production, implying a role for the autophagolysosome in the DENV-3 life cycle. Evidence based upon the co-localization of LC3 and cathepsin D with double stranded RNA and NS1 protein, as assessed by confocal microscopy, support a model in which DENV-3 interacts with both amphisomes and autophagolysosomes. These results demonstrate that the interactions between DENV and the host cell autophagy machinery are complex and may be determined in part by virus-encoded factors.

TI  - A single amino acid substitution in the NS4B protein of Dengue virus confers enhanced virus growth and fitness in human cells in vitro through IFN-dependent host response.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 99 8
SP  - 1044
EP  - 1057
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) replication between mosquito and human hosts is hypothesized to be associated with viral determinants that interact in a differential manner between hosts. However, the understanding of inter-host viral determinants that drive DENV replication and growth between hosts is limited. Through the use of clinical isolates, we identified an amino acid variation of Ala, Met and Val at position 116 of DENV-1 NS4B. While the proportion of virus with the NS4B-116V variant remained constantly high in serial passages in a mosquito cell line, populations of the NS4B-116M and NS4B-116A variants became dominant after serial passages in mammalian cell lines. Using recombinant DENV-1 viruses, the Val to Ala or Met alteration at position NS4B-116 (rDENV-1-NS4B-116A and rDENV-1-NS4B-116M) resulted in enhanced virus growth in human cells in comparison to the clone with Val at NS4B-116 (rDENV-1-NS4B-116V). However, the reverse phenomenon was observed in a mosquito cell line. Additionally, in a human cell line, differential levels of IFN-α/β and IFN-stimulated gene expressions (IFIT3, IFI44L, OAS1) suggested that the enhanced viral growth was dependent on the ability of the NS4B protein to hamper host IFN response during the early phase of infection. Overall, we identified a novel and critical viral determinant at the pTMD3 of NS4B region that displayed differential effects on DENV replication and fitness in human and mosquito cell lines. Taken together, the results suggest the importance of the NS4B protein in virus replication and adaptation between hosts.

TI  - A single mutation in the envelope protein modulates flavivirus antigenicity, stability, and pathogenesis
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 13
AB  - The structural flexibility or ‘breathing’ of the envelope (E) protein of flaviviruses allows virions to sample an ensemble of conformations at equilibrium. The molecular basis and functional consequences of virus conformational dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we identified a single mutation at residue 198 (T198F) of the West Nile virus (WNV) E protein domain I-II hinge that regulates virus breathing. The T198F mutation resulted in a ~70-fold increase in sensitivity to neutralization by a monoclonal antibody targeting a cryptic epitope in the fusion loop. Increased exposure of this otherwise poorly accessible fusion loop epitope was accompanied by reduced virus stability in solution at physiological temperatures. Introduction of a mutation at the analogous residue of dengue virus (DENV), but not Zika virus (ZIKV), E protein also increased accessibility of the cryptic fusion loop epitope and decreased virus stability in solution, suggesting that this residue modulates the structural ensembles sampled by distinct flaviviruses at equilibrium in a context dependent manner. Although the T198F mutation did not substantially impair WNV growth kinetics in vitro, studies in mice revealed attenuation of WNV T198F infection. Overall, our study provides insight into the molecular basis and the in vitro and in vivo consequences of flavivirus breathing.

TI  - A single nucleotide change in the E protein gene of dengue virus 2 Mexican strain affects neurovirulence in mice.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 77 ( Pt 10)
SP  - 2541
EP  - 5
AB  - Eleven clones of dengue virus 2 Mexican strain were selected by the size of their lytic plaques. Nucleotide sequences of the clones producing large plaques (D2ML2, D2ML3 and D2ML4) revealed 11 mutations, 10 of which were silent. The substitution at nucleotide 1168 (G-->C) generates one amino acid difference at residue 390 (Asp-->His) of the envelope protein (E). These clones showed high virulence in suckling mice when inoculated intracerebrally (> or = 70% mortality). However, the clones which showed small lytic plaques (D2MS1, D2MS2 and D2MS4) displayed a substitution from Asp-->Asn at the same position and had attenuated virulence. Based on these data, we suggest that substitution of Asp-->His at residue 390 perhaps affects a functionally important structural element that could be a determinant of dengue neurovirulence. This substitution falls in domain III of the E protein, which plays an important role in viral binding; therefore, we propose that the substitution affects virulence and cellular tropism.

TI  - A small region of the dengue virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5, confers interaction with both the nuclear transport receptor importin-beta and the viral helicase, NS3.

VL  - 82 Pt 4
SP  - 735
EP  - 45
AB  - The dengue virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5, and the protease/helicase, NS3, are multidomain proteins that have been shown to interact both in vivo and in vitro. A hyperphosphorylated form of NS5 that does not interact with NS3 has been detected in the nuclei of virus-infected cells, presumably as the result of the action of a functional nuclear localization sequence within the interdomain region of NS5 (residues 369-405). In this study, it is shown by using the yeast two-hybrid system that the C-terminal region of NS3 (residues 303-618) interacts with the N-terminal region of NS5 (residues 320-368). Further, it is shown that this same region of NS5 is also recognized by the cellular nuclear import receptor importin-beta. The interaction between NS5 and importin-beta and competition by NS3 with the latter for the same binding site on NS5 were confirmed by pull-down assays. The direct interaction of importin-beta with NS5 has implications for the mechanism by which this normally cytoplasmic protein may be targetted to the nucleus.

TI  - A specific EMC subunit supports Dengue virus infection by promoting virus membrane fusion essential for cytosolic genome delivery
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 18
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) represents the most common human arboviral infection, yet its cellular entry mechanism remains unclear. The multi-subunit endoplasmic reticulum membrane complex (EMC) supports DENV infection, in part, by assisting the biosynthesis of viral proteins critical for downstream replication steps. Intriguingly, the EMC has also been shown to act at an earlier step prior to viral protein biogenesis, although this event is not well-defined. Here we demonstrate that the EMC subunit EMC4 promotes fusion of the DENV and endosomal membranes during entry, enabling delivery of the viral genome into the cytosol which is then targeted to the ER for viral protein biosynthesis. We also found that EMC4 mediates ER-to-endosome transfer of phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid whose presence in the endosome facilitates DENV-endosomal membrane fusion. These findings clarify the EMC-dependent DENV early entry step, suggesting a mechanism by which an ER-localized host factor can regulate viral fusion at the endosome.

TI  - A symbiotic mosquito‐gut bacterium for flavivirus control
JF  - Clinical and Translational Medicine
VL  - 14
AB  - Abstract Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) have emerged as major global public health challenges, causing numerous infections and fatalities each year. However, current measures, including vaccines and treatments, are often limited or ineffective. This highlights the urgent need for novel preventive strategies to control the spread of key mosquito‐borne viruses like DENV and ZIKV. In a recent study published in Science, Zhang et al. isolated a bacterium named Rosenbergiella_YN46 from the gut of field‐caught Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in Yunnan Province, China. This commentary reviews their findings, published on April 19, 2024, which describe the symbiotic bacterium Rosenbergiella_YN46 and its ability to block flavivirus transmission, including both DENV and ZIKV. The bacterium shows promising potential for future dengue fever prevention and provides valuable insights into a novel biological approach for controlling mosquito‐borne viral diseases.

TI  - A systematic review of observational studies on oxidative/nitrosative stress involvement in dengue pathogenesis
JF  - Colombia Médica : CM
VL  - 46
SP  - 135
EP  - 143
AB  - Objective: Our objective was to systematically review the published observational research related to the role of oxidative-nitrosative stress in pathogenesis of dengue. Methods: We searched electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, The COCHRANE library, ScienceDirect, Scopus, SciELO, LILACS via Virtual Health Library, Google Scholar) using the term: dengue, dengue virus, severe dengue, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, antioxidants, oxidants, free radicals, oxidized lipid products, lipid peroxides, nitric oxide, and nitric oxide synthase. 
 Articles were selected for review by title and abstract excluding letter, review, in vivo and in vitro studies, and duplicates studies. Selected articles were reviewed for study design, original purposes, sample size, main outcomes, methods, and oxidative-nitrosative stress markers values. Results: In total, 4,331 non-duplicates articles were identified from electronic databases searches, of which 16 were eligible for full text searching. Data from the observational studies originate from Asian countries (50%; 8/16), South American countries (31.2%; 5/16), and Central America and the Caribbean countries (18.8%; 3/16). Case-control study was the type of design most common in researches reviewed. The 1997 World Health Organization (WHO) dengue case classification criteria were used in all studies included in this review. Conclusions: Based on published data found in peer-reviewed literature, oxidative and nitrosative stress are demonstrated by changes in plasma levels of nitric oxide, antioxidants, lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation markers in patients with dengue infection. Additionally, elevated serum protein carbonyls and malondialdehyde levels appear to be associated with dengue disease severity.

TI  - A transcriptomic survey of the impact of environmental stress on response to dengue virus in the mosquito, Aedes aegypti
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 12
AB  - Populations of Aedes aegypti naturally exhibit variable susceptibility to dengue viruses. This natural variation can be impacted by nutritional stress resulting from larval-stage crowding, indicating the influence of environment components on the adult mosquito immune response. In particular, larval crowding was previously shown to reduce the susceptibility of adult females of a Trinidad field isolate of A. aegypti to the dengue serotype 2 (JAM1409) virus. Here, we present the first whole transcriptome study to address the impact of environmental stress on A. aegypti response to dengue virus. We examined expression profiles of adult females resulting from crowded and optimum reared larvae from the same Trinidad isolate at two critical early time points—3 and 18 hours post dengue virus infected blood meal. We exposed specimens to either a dengue or naïve blood meal, and then characterized the response in ten gene co-expression modules based on their transcriptional associations with environmental stress and time. We further analyzed the top 30 hub or master regulatory genes in each of the modules, and validated our results via qRT-PCR. These hub genes reveal which functions are critical to the mechanisms that confer dengue virus refractoriness or susceptibility to stress conditioned A. aegypti, as well as the time points at which they are most important.

TI  - A variant in the CD209 promoter is associated with severity of dengue disease
JF  - Nature Genetics
VL  - 37
SP  - 507
EP  - 513
AB  - Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever are mosquito-borne viral diseases. Dendritic cell–specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN1, encoded by CD209), an attachment receptor of dengue virus, is essential for productive infection of dendritic cells. Here, we report strong association between a promoter variant of CD209, DCSIGN1-336, and risk of dengue fever compared with dengue hemorrhagic fever or population controls. The G allele of the variant DCSIGN1-336 was associated with strong protection against dengue fever in three independent cohorts from Thailand, with a carrier frequency of 4.7% in individuals with dengue fever compared with 22.4% in individuals with dengue hemorrhagic fever (odds ratio for risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever versus dengue fever: 5.84, P = 1.4 × 10−7) and 19.5% in controls (odds ratio for protection: 4.90, P = 2 × 10−6). This variant affects an Sp1-like binding site and transcriptional activity in vitro. These results indicate that CD209 has a crucial role in dengue pathogenesis, which discriminates between severe dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. This may have consequences for therapeutic and preventive strategies.

Finally, the authors identify the DENV2 NS1 gene as an mRNA target for vsRNA-5. …

TI  - AA IDO1 Variant Genotype (G2431A, rs3739319) Is Associated with Severe Dengue Risk Development in a DEN-3 Brazilian Cohort.
JF  - Viral immunology
AB  - Dengue is considered one of the most challenging public health threats in the world. Infection may be clinically asymptomatic but can result in severe forms. The indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) gene encodes one of first enzymes (IDO) of the kynurenine pathway. This study aimed to verify the association between G2431A IDO1 gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs3739319) and dengue fever development. We included 299 dengue-infected individuals in the study and 96 dengue-free controls. We collected clinical and diagnostic test data and divided the patients with dengue infection into three groups, based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria: 131 Dengue without warning signs (DWOS), 143 Dengue with warning signs (DWS), and 25 severe dengue (SD). We genotyped 193 of the dengue cases using quantitative polymerase chain reaction to the SNP rs3739319. The other 106 dengue cases and 96 dengue-free controls had previously been genotyped using the Illumina Genotyping Kit. Genotyping of the infected patients revealed frequencies of 106 GG (35.4%), 126 GA (42.1%), and 67 AA (22.4%), whereas the nondengue exposed control group showed similar frequencies, 29 GG (30.2%), 52 GA (54.2%), and 15 AA (15.6%). Under risk analysis we found that AA genotype patients had a higher risk of developing SD in a codominant model (AA × GG; odds ratio [OR] = 11.5-fold in comparison to non-SD group -DWOS and -DWS patients; confidence interval [CI] = 0.02-0.32; Yates correction = 1.9e-05) and in a recessive model (AA × AG+GG; OR = 9.41; CI = 3.62-26.7; Yates correction = 4.8e-08). An allelic model reinforced the association between A allele and SD phenotype development that was found in the SD versus DWOS+DWS analysis (OR = 3.59; CI = 1.50-9.56; Yates correction = 0.0033). Our data show an association between the IDO G2431A variant and the risk for SD. This SNP may be relevant for further investigation into disease mechanisms and host factors in future genetic and pathophysiological studies.

TI  - AB Initio Structural Analysis on Envelope (E) Glycoprotein of Dengue Virus (DENV) Type 1-4
JF  -

SP  - 58
EP  - 
AB  - Any serotypes of dengue virus (DENV), which are DENV1-4, may lead to dengue infections. DENV spread via mosquito vector, primarily Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. DENV is one of the most prevalent viruses, which is causing dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) that may be fatal. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs and effective vaccination available to combat DENV infections. Major component of DENV which plays the important role for viral binding to the receptor to induce the infection is an envelope (E) glycoprotein. The B-cell and T-cell epitopes for DENV1-4 are not yet determined. An effective vaccine against DENV infections should be a tetravalent vaccine that can counter-attack all four serotypes. Therefore, E glycoproteins of all four serotypes was chosen to be analyzed. Conserved regions were found in 100 sequences of each DENV serotype. Multiple sequence alignments was done to obtain consensus sequence. Multiple bioinformatics tools were used for prediction of B-cell and T-cell epitopes based on antigenicity, hydrophilicity, beta-turn, flexibility and surface accessibility. Secondary and tertiary structures of E glycoprotein for each serotypes were predicted and aligned. Complete analysis showed that predicted epitopes were located within conserved regions, and DENV2 showed the highest percentage of mutation rates and had the highest similarity to DENV1, DENV3 and DENV4.

TI  - ADAP2 Is an Interferon Stimulated Gene That Restricts RNA Virus Entry
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) target viruses at various stages of their infectious life cycles, including at the earliest stage of viral entry. Here we identify ArfGAP with dual pleckstrin homology (PH) domains 2 (ADAP2) as a gene upregulated by type I IFN treatment in a STAT1-dependent manner. ADAP2 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Arf6 and binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) and PI(3,4)P2. We show that overexpression of ADAP2 suppresses dengue virus (DENV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection in an Arf6 GAP activity-dependent manner, while exerting no effect on coxsackievirus B (CVB) or Sendai virus (SeV) replication. We further show that ADAP2 expression induces macropinocytosis and that ADAP2 strongly associates with actin-enriched membrane ruffles and with Rab8a- and LAMP1-, but not EEA1- or Rab7-, positive vesicles. Utilizing two techniques—light-sensitive neutral red (NR)-containing DENV and fluorescence assays for virus internalization—we show that ADAP2 primarily restricts DENV infection at the stage of virion entry and/or intracellular trafficking and that incoming DENV and VSV particles associate with ADAP2 during their entry. Taken together, this study identifies ADAP2 as an ISG that exerts antiviral effects against RNA viruses by altering Arf6-mediated trafficking to disrupt viral entry.

TI  - AMP-Activated Protein Kinase and Host Defense against Infection
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 19
AB  - 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays diverse roles in various physiological and pathological conditions. AMPK is involved in energy metabolism, which is perturbed by infectious stimuli. Indeed, various pathogens modulate AMPK activity, which affects host defenses against infection. In some viral infections, including hepatitis B and C viral infections, AMPK activation is beneficial, but in others such as dengue virus, Ebola virus, and human cytomegaloviral infections, AMPK plays a detrimental role. AMPK-targeting agents or small molecules enhance the antiviral response and contribute to the control of microbial and parasitic infections. In addition, this review focuses on the double-edged role of AMPK in innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. Understanding how AMPK regulates host defenses will enable development of more effective host-directed therapeutic strategies against infectious diseases.

TI  - AMPK Activation Downregulates TXNIP, Rab5, and Rab7 Within Minutes, Thereby Inhibiting the Endocytosis-Mediated Entry of Human Pathogenic Viruses
JF  - Cells
VL  - 14
AB  - Cellular metabolism must adapt rapidly to environmental alterations and adjust nutrient uptake. Low glucose availability activates the AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) pathway. We demonstrate that activation of AMPK or the downstream Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase (ULK1) inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis. Beyond limiting dextran uptake, this activation prevents endocytic uptake of human pathogenic enveloped and non-enveloped, positive- and negative-stranded RNA viruses, such as yellow fever, dengue, tick-borne encephalitis, chikungunya, polio, rubella, rabies lyssavirus, and SARS-CoV-2, not only in mammalian and insect cells but also in precision-cut lung slices and neuronal organoids. ULK1 activation inhibited enveloped viruses but not EV71. However, receptor presentation at the cytoplasmic membrane remained unaffected, indicating that receptor binding was unchanged, while later stages of endocytosis were targeted via two distinct pathways. Drug-induced activation of the AMPK pathway reduced early endocytic factor TXNIP by suppressing translation. In contrast, the amounts of Rab5 and the late endosomal marker Rab7 decreased due to translation inactivation and ULK1-dependent proteasome activation within minutes. Furthermore, activation of AMPK hindered the late replication steps of SARS-CoV-2 by reducing viral RNAs and proteins and the endo-lysosomal markers LAMP1 and GRP78, suggesting a reduction in early and late endosomes and lysosomes. Inhibition of the PI3K and mTORC2 pathways, which sense amino acid and growth factor availability, promotes AMPK activity and blocks viral entry. Our results indicate that AMPK and ULK1 emerge as restriction factors of cellular endocytosis, impeding the receptor-mediated endocytic entry of enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses.

TI  - ASSOCIATION OF CYTOKINE-RELATED GENE EXPRESSION WITH DENGUE INFECTION SEVERITY
JF  - Pediatrics
VL  - 121
SP  - S132
EP  - S132
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease and one of the most serious infectious diseases worldwide. Infection by any of the serotypes of dengue viruses (DEN-1–DEN-4) may result in different severities ranging from a relatively benign fever, called dengue fever (DF), to fatal dengue shock syndrome. The pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome is thought to be mediated by various host factors. Previous reports have suggested an involvement of immunoresponse mediators as well as apoptosis-related molecules in the severity of dengue infection. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to elucidate the cellular gene responses to dengue viral infection at the transcriptional level and to correlate expression levels with disease activity and/or clinical manifestation. METHODS: Expression levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8), IL-1β, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and Fas in peripheral blood cells were assayed for 10 children with DF, 10 children with DHF, and 5 healthy controls by using real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Expression levels of IL-8, IL-1β, MMP-9, and Fas were higher in children who developed DHF than in those with DF. CONCLUSIONS: The messenger RNA expression levels of IL-8, IL-1β, MMP-9, and Fas were significantly elevated in children with DHF, which suggests that these mediators are involved in the pathogenesis. The messenger RNA expression level might serve as a predictor of dengue disease activity. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction has a potential to be another rapid and useful tool in assessing disease severity, leading to a proper therapeutic plan.

TI  - ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channels reveal functional linkage between salivary gland function and blood feeding in the mosquito, Aedes aegypti
JF  - Communications Biology
VL  - 5
AB  - Reducing saliva secretions into the vertebrate host reduces feeding efficacy by most hematophagous arthropods. However, seminal studies suggested saliva is not a prerequisite for blood feeding in Aedes aegypti. To test this paradigm, we manually transected the salivary duct of female A. aegypti and an inability to salivate was correlated to an inability to imbibe blood. These data justified testing the relevance of inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels in the A. aegypti salivary gland as an antifeedant target site. Pharmacological activation of ATP-gated Kir (KATP) channels reduced the secretory activity of the salivary gland by 15-fold that led to near elimination of blood ingestion during feeding. The reduced salivation and feeding success nearly eliminated horizontal transmission and acquisition of Dengue virus-2 (DENV2). These data suggest mosquito salivation is a prerequisite for blood feeding and provide evidence that KATP channels are critical for salivation, feeding, and vector competency. The salivary gland of Aedes aegypti is needed for efficient blood feeding, and disruption of ATP-gated Kir channels prevents salivation and blood feeding in A. aegypti as well as horizontal transmission and acquisition of Dengue virus2.

TI  - AXL, an Important Host Factor for DENV and ZIKV Replication
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Flaviviruses, as critically important pathogens, are still major public health problems all over the world. For instance, the evolution of ZIKV led to large-scale outbreaks in the Yap island in 2007. DENV was considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the 10 threats to global health in 2019. Enveloped viruses hijack a variety of host factors to complete its replication cycle. Phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor, AXL, is considered to be a candidate receptor for flavivirus invasion. In this review, we discuss the molecular structure of ZIKV and DENV, and how they interact with AXL to successfully invade host cells. A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms of flavivirus-AXL interaction will provide crucial insights into the virus infection process and the development of anti-flavivirus therapeutics.

TI  - Aberrant monocyte responses predict and characterize dengue virus infection in individuals with severe disease
JF  - Journal of Translational Medicine
VL  - 15
AB  - Currently, several assays can diagnose acute dengue infection. However, none of these assays can predict the severity of the disease. Biomarkers that predicts the likelihood that a dengue patient will develop a severe form of the disease could permit more efficient patient triage and allows better supportive care for the individual in need, especially during dengue outbreaks. We measured 20 plasma markers i.e. IFN-γ, IL-10, granzyme-B, CX3CL1, IP-10, RANTES, CXCL8, CXCL6, VCAM, ICAM, VEGF, HGF, sCD25, IL-18, LBP, sCD14, sCD163, MIF, MCP-1 and MIP-1β in 141 dengue patients in over 230 specimens and correlate the levels of these plasma markers with the development of dengue without warning signs (DWS−), dengue with warning signs (DWS+) and severe dengue (SD). Our results show that the elevation of plasma levels of IL-18 at both febrile and defervescence phase was significantly associated with DWS+ and SD; whilst increase of sCD14 and LBP at febrile phase were associated with severity of dengue disease. By using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the IL-18, LBP and sCD14 were significantly predicted the development of more severe form of dengue disease (DWS+/SD) (AUC = 0.768, P < 0.0001; AUC = 0.819, P < 0.0001 and AUC = 0.647, P = 0.014 respectively). Furthermore, we also found that the levels of VEGF were directly correlated and sCD14 was inversely correlated with platelet count, suggesting that the endothelial activation and microbial translocation may played a role in pathogenesis of dengue disease. Given that the elevation IL-18, LBP and sCD14 among patients with severe form of dengue disease, our findings suggest a pathogenic role for an aberrant inflammasome and monocyte activation in the development of severe form of dengue disease.

TI  - Actin Interacts with Dengue Virus 2 and 4 Envelope Proteins
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) remains a significant public health problem in many tropical and sub-tropical countries worldwide. The DENV envelope (E) protein is the major antigenic determinant and the protein that mediates receptor binding and endosomal fusion. In contrast to some other DENV proteins, relatively few cellular interacting proteins have been identified. To address this issue a co-immuoprecipitation strategy was employed. The predominant co-immunoprecipitating proteins identified were actin and actin related proteins, however the results suggested that actin was the only bona fide interacting partner. Actin was shown to interact with the E protein of DENV 2 and 4, and the interaction between actin and DENV E protein was shown to occur in a truncated DENV consisting of only domains I and II. Actin was shown to decrease during infection, but this was not associated with a decrease in gene transcription. Actin-related proteins also showed a decrease in expression during infection that was not transcriptionally regulated. Cytoskeletal reorganization was not observed during infection, suggesting that the interaction between actin and E protein has a cell type specific component.

TI  - Activation of Nrf2 by the dengue virus causes an increase in CLEC5A, which enhances TNF-α production by mononuclear phagocytes
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 6
AB  - Infection by the dengue virus (DENV) threatens global public health due to its high prevalence and the lack of effective treatments. Host factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of DENV; herein, we investigated the role of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), which is activated by DENV in mononuclear phagocytes. DENV infection selectively activates Nrf2 following nuclear translocation. Following endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress, protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) facilitated Nrf2-mediated transcriptional activation of C-type lectin domain family 5, member A (CLEC5A) to increase CLEC5A expression. Signaling downstream of the Nrf2-CLEC5A interaction enhances Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-independent tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production following DENV infection. Forced expression of the NS2B3 viral protein induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation/activation and CLEC5A expression which increases DENV-induced TNF-α production. Animal studies confirmed Nrf2-induced CLEC5A and TNF-α in brains of DENV-infected mice. These results demonstrate that DENV infection causes Nrf2-regulated TNF-α production by increasing levels of CLEC5A.

TI  - Activation of Src-family kinases orchestrate secretion of flaviviruses by targeting mature progeny virions to secretory autophagosomes
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Among the various host cellular processes that are hijacked by flaviviruses, very few mechanisms have been described with regard to viral secretion. Here we investigated how flaviviruses exploit the Src family kinases (SFKs) for exit from infected cells. We isolated three members of the SFK family – Src, Fyn and Lyn – that were specifically activated during secretion of Dengue and Zika or their corresponding virus like particles (VLPs). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs blocked virus secretion, most significantly upon Lyn-deficiency. Lyn-/- cells were severely impaired in virus release, and were rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We further established that Lyn, via its palmitoylation-dependent membrane association, triggered post-Golgi virus transport in specialised Rab11 and Transferrin receptor positive organelles resembling secretory autophagosomes, and distinct from conventional exocytic vesicles. In the absence of Lyn activity or its aberrant membrane association, virions were sorted into the lysosomal pathway for degradation. This mode of export was specifically triggered by processed, and mature, but not by furin-resistant virus particles, and occurred with significantly faster kinetics than the conventional secretory pathway. Our study therefore charts a previously undiscovered Lyn-dependent exit strategy, triggered by flaviviruses in secretory autophagosomes that might enable them to evade circulating antibodies and dictate tissue tropism.

TI  - Activation of TLR2 and TLR6 by Dengue NS1 Protein and Its Implications in the Immunopathogenesis of Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) infection is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease and its manifestation has been shown to be contributed in part by the host immune responses. In this study, pathogen recognition receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR6 were found to be up-regulated in DV-infected human PBMC using immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry and Western blot analyses. Using ELISA, IL-6 and TNF-α, cytokines downstream of TLR2 and TLR6 signaling pathways were also found to be up-regulated in DV-infected PBMC. IL-6 and TNF-α production by PBMC were reduced when TLR2 and TLR6 were blocked using TLR2 and TLR6 neutralizing antibodies during DV infection. These results suggested that signaling pathways of TLR2 and TLR6 were activated during DV infection and its activation contributed to IL-6 and TNF-α production. DV NS1 protein was found to significantly increase the production of IL-6 and TNF-α when added to PBMC. The amount of IL-6 and TNF-α stimulated by DV NS1 protein was reduced when TLR2 and TLR6 were blocked, suggesting that DV NS1 protein is the viral protein responsible for the activation of TLR2 and TLR6 during DV infection. Secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter assay was used to further confirm activation of TLR2 and TLR6 by DV NS1 protein. In addition, DV-infected and DV NS1 protein-treated TLR6-/- mice have higher survivability compared to DV-infected and DV NS1 protein-treated wild-type mice. Hence, activation of TLR6 via DV NS1 protein could potentially play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of DV infection.

TI  - Activation of TLR4 by viral glycoproteins: A double-edged sword?
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - Recognition of viral infection by pattern recognition receptors is paramount for a successful immune response to viral infection. However, an unbalanced proinflammatory response can be detrimental to the host. Recently, multiple studies have identified that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), resulting in the induction of proinflammatory cytokine expression. Activation of TLR4 by viral glycoproteins has also been observed in the context of other viral infection models, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue virus (DENV) and Ebola virus (EBOV). However, the mechanisms involved in virus-TLR4 interactions have remained unclear. Here, we review viral glycoproteins that act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns to induce an immune response via TLR4. We explore the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying how viral glycoproteins are recognized by TLR4 and discuss the contribution of TLR4 activation to viral pathogenesis. We identify contentious findings and research gaps that highlight the importance of understanding viral glycoprotein-mediated TLR4 activation for potential therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Activation of Toll-Like Receptor 3 Impairs the Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Replication through Induction of IFN-β in Cultured Hepatoma Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 6
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in innate immunity against invading pathogens. Although TLR signaling has been indicated to protect cells from infection of several viruses, the role of TLRs in Dengue virus (DENV) replication is still unclear. In the present study, we examined the replication of DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) by challenging hepatoma cells HepG2 with different TLR ligands. Activation of TLR3 showed an antiviral effect, while pretreatment of other TLR ligands (including TLR1/2, TLR2/6, TLR4, TLR5 or TLR7/8) did not show a significant effect. TLR3 ligand poly(I∶C) treatment prior to viral infection or simultaneously, but not post-treatment, significantly down-regulated virus replication. Pretreatment with poly(I∶C) reduced viral mRNA expression and viral staining positive cells, accompanying an induction of the type I interferon (IFN-β) and type III IFN (IL-28A/B). Intriguingly, neutralization of IFN-β alone successfully restored the poly(I∶C)-inhibited replication of DENV2. The poly(I∶C)-mediated effects, including IFN induction and DENV2 suppression, were significantly reversed by IKK inhibitor, further suggesting that IFN-β is the dominant factor involved in the poly(I∶C) mediated antiviral effect. Our study presented the first evidence to show that activation of TLR3 is effective in blocking DENV2 replication via IFN-β, providing an experimental clue that poly(I∶C) may be a promising immunomodulatory agent against DENV infection and might be applicable for clinical prevention.

TI  - Activation of dengue virus-specific T cells modulates vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 expression.
JF  - Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology
VL  - 35 3
SP  - 171
EP  - 178
AB  - BACKGROUND
The pathogenic mechanisms underlying the increased vascular permeability in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are not well understood. Enhanced cellular immune activation, especially activation of serotype-cross reactive T cells, has been implicated in plasma leakage in DHF. Changes in several biological markers and mediators including cytokines, chemokines, angiogenic factors and their receptors have been shown to correlate with disease severity. A decline in plasma levels of a soluble form of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a receptor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been associated with plasma leakage in dengue patients.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to investigate the effect of dengue virus (DV)-specific CD8⁺ T cells on the expression of VEGFR2 on endothelial cells.


METHODS
An in vitro model was developed in which dengue virus-specific CD8⁺ T cells generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of DHF patients were co-cultured with antigen-presenting cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and activated with DV non-structural protein 3 (NS3) peptides. The expression of VEGFR2 by endothelial cells was measured.


RESULTS
DV-specific CD8⁺ T cells were serotype cross-reactive. Activation of DV-specific CD8⁺ T cells resulted in down-regulation of soluble VEGFR2 production and an up-regulation of cell-associated VEGFR2.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings indicate that activation of DV-specific T cell is associated with modulation of VEGFR2 expression that may contribute to increased VEGF responsiveness and vascular permeability.

TI  - Activation of the autophagy pathway decreases dengue virus infection in Aedes aegypti cells
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 14
AB  - Mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV) causes major disease worldwide, impacting 50–100 million people every year, and is spread by the major mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. Understanding mosquito physiology, including antiviral mechanisms, and developing new control strategies have become an important step towards the elimination of DENV disease. In the study reported here, we focused on autophagy, a pathway suggested as having a positive influence on virus replication in humans, as a potential antiviral target in the mosquito. To understand the role played by autophagy in Ae. aegypti, we examined the activation of this pathway in Aag-2 cells, an Ae. aegypti-derived cell line, infected with DENV. Rapamycin and 3-methyladenine, two small molecules that have been shown to affect the function of the autophagy pathway, were used to activate or suppress, respectively, the autophagy pathway. At 1-day post-DENV infection in Aag-2 cells, transcript levels of both the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3-II) and autophagy-related protein 1 (ATG1) increased. Rapamycin treatment activated the autophagy pathway as early as 1-h post-treatment, and the virus titer had decreased in the Aag-2 cells at 2 days post-infection; in contrast, the 3-methyladenine treatment did not significantly affect the DENV titer. Treatment with these small molecules also impacted the ATG12 transcript levels in DENV-infected cells. Our studies revealed that activation of the autophagy pathway through rapamycin treatment altered DENV infection in the mosquito cells, suggesting that this pathway could be a possible antiviral mechanism in the mosquito system. Here we provide fundamental information needed to proceed with future experiments and to improve our understanding of the mosquito’s immune response against DENV.

TI  - Activity of Recombinant Dengue 2 Virus NS3 Protease in the Presence of a Truncated NS2B Co-factor, Small Peptide Substrates, and Inhibitors*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 276
SP  - 45762
EP  - 45771
AB  - Recombinant forms of the dengue 2 virus NS3 protease linked to a 40-residue co-factor, corresponding to part of NS2B, have been expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to be active against para-nitroanilide substrates comprising the P6-P1 residues of four substrate cleavage sequences. The enzyme is inactive alone or after the addition of a putative 13-residue co-factor peptide but is active when fused to the 40-residue co-factor, by either a cleavable or a noncleavable glycine linker. The NS4B/NS5 cleavage site was processed most readily, with optimal processing conditions being pH 9, I = 10 mm, 1 mmCHAPS, 20% glycerol. A longer 10-residue peptide corresponding to the NS2B/NS3 cleavage site (P6-P4′) was a poorer substrate than the hexapeptide (P6-P1) para-nitroanilide substrate under these conditions, suggesting that the prime side substrate residues did not contribute significantly to protease binding. We also report the first inhibitors of a co-factor-complexed, catalytically active flavivirus NS3 protease. Aprotinin was the only standard serine protease inhibitor to be active, whereas a number of peptide substrate analogues were found to be competitive inhibitors at micromolar concentrations.

TI  - Acyl-Coa Thioesterases: A Rheostat That Controls Activated Fatty Acids Modulates Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Replication
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - During infection with dengue viruses (DENVs), the lipid landscape within host cells is significantly altered to assemble membrane platforms that support viral replication and particle assembly. Fatty acyl-CoAs are key intermediates in the biosynthesis of complex lipids that form these membranes. They also function as key signaling lipids in the cell. Here, we carried out loss of function studies on acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOTs), a family of enzymes that hydrolyze fatty acyl-CoAs to free fatty acids and coenzyme A, to understand their influence on the lifecycle of DENVs. The loss of function of the type I ACOTs 1 (cytoplasmic) and 2 (mitochondrial) together significantly increased DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) viral replication and infectious particle release. However, isolated knockdown of mitochondrial ACOT2 significantly decreased DENV2 protein translation, genome replication, and infectious virus release. Furthermore, loss of ACOT7 function, a mitochondrial type II ACOT, similarly suppressed DENV2. As ACOT1 and ACOT2 are splice variants, these data suggest that functional differences and substrate specificities due to the location (cytosol and mitochondria, respectively) of these proteins may account for the differences in DENV2 infection phenotype. Additionally, loss of mitochondrial ACOT2 and ACOT7 expression also altered the expression of several ACOTs located in multiple organelle compartments within the cell, highlighting a complex relationship between ACOTs in the DENV2 virus lifecycle.

TI  - Adaptor Protein 1A Facilitates Dengue Virus Replication
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 10
AB  - Rearrangement of membrane structure induced by dengue virus (DENV) is essential for replication, and requires host cellular machinery. Adaptor protein complex (AP)-1 is a host component, which can be recruited to components required for membrane rearrangement. Therefore, dysfunction of AP-1 may affect membrane organization, thereby decreasing replication of virus in infected cells. In the present study, AP-1-dependent traffic inhibitor inhibited DENV protein expression and virion production. We further clarified the role of AP-1A in the life cycle of DENV by RNA interference. AP-1A was not involved in DENV entry into cells. However, it facilitated DENV RNA replication. Viral RNA level was reduced significantly in Huh7 cells transfected with AP-1A small interfering RNA (siRNA) compared with control siRNA. Transfection of naked DENV viral RNA into Huh7 cells transfected with AP-1A siRNA resulted in less viral RNA and virion production than transfection into Huh7 cells transfected with control siRNA. Huh7 cells transfected with AP-1A siRNA showed greater modification of membrane structures and fewer vesicular packets compared with cells transfected with control siRNA. Therefore, AP-1A may partly control DENV-induced rearrangement of membrane structures required for viral replication.

TI  - Adaptor protein complexes-1 and 3 are involved at distinct stages of flavivirus life-cycle
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 3
AB  - Intracellular protein trafficking pathways are hijacked by viruses at various stages of viral life-cycle. Heterotetrameric adaptor protein complexes (APs) mediate vesicular trafficking at distinct intracellular sites and are essential for maintaining the organellar homeostasis. In the present study, we studied the effect of AP-1 and AP-3 deficiency on flavivirus infection in cells functionally lacking these proteins. We show that AP-1 and AP-3 participate in flavivirus life-cycle at distinct stages. AP-3-deficient cells showed delay in initiation of Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue virus RNA replication, which resulted in reduction of infectious virus production. AP-3 was found to colocalize with RNA replication compartments in infected wild-type cells. AP-1 deficiency affected later stages of dengue virus infection where increased intracellular accumulation of infectious virus was observed. Therefore, our results propose a novel role for AP-1 and AP-3 at distinct stages of infection of some of the RNA viruses.

TI  - Administration of Defective Virus Inhibits Dengue Transmission into Mosquitoes
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - The host-vector shuttle and the bottleneck in dengue transmission is a significant aspect with regard to the study of dengue outbreaks. As mosquitoes require 100–1000 times more virus to become infected than human, the transmission of dengue virus from human to mosquito is a vulnerability that can be targeted to improve disease control. In order to capture the heterogeneity in the infectiousness of an infected patient population towards the mosquito population, we calibrate a population of host-to-vector virus transmission models based on an experimentally quantified infected fraction of a mosquito population. Once the population of models is well-calibrated, we deploy a population of controls that helps to inhibit the human-to-mosquito transmission of the dengue virus indirectly by reducing the viral load in the patient body fluid. We use an optimal bang-bang control on the administration of the defective virus (transmissible interfering particles (TIPs)) to symptomatic patients in the course of their febrile period and observe the dynamics in successful reduction of dengue spread into mosquitoes.

TI  - Aedes Anphevirus: an Insect-Specific Virus Distributed Worldwide in Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes That Has Complex Interplays with Wolbachia and Dengue Virus Infection in Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 92
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti transmits a number of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), such as dengue virus and Zika virus. Mosquitoes also harbor insect-specific viruses that may affect replication of pathogenic arboviruses in their body. Currently, however, there are only a few insect-specific viruses described from A. aegypti in the literature. Here, we characterize a novel negative-strand virus, AeAV. Meta-analysis of A. aegypti samples showed that it is present in A. aegypti mosquitoes worldwide and is vertically transmitted. Wolbachia-transinfected mosquitoes are currently being used in biocontrol, as they effectively block transmission of several positive-sense RNA viruses in mosquitoes. Our results demonstrate that Wolbachia enhances the replication of AeAV and modestly reduces dengue virus replication in a cell line model. This study expands our understanding of the virome in A. aegypti as well as providing insight into the complexity of the Wolbachia virus restriction phenotype. ABSTRACT Insect-specific viruses (ISVs) of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti have been demonstrated to modulate transmission of arboviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus by the mosquito. The diversity and composition of the virome of A. aegypti, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we characterized Aedes anphevirus (AeAV), a negative-sense RNA virus from the order Mononegavirales. AeAV identified from Aedes cell lines was infectious to both A. aegypti and Aedes albopictus cells but not to three mammalian cell lines. To understand the incidence and genetic diversity of AeAV, we assembled 17 coding-complete and two partial genomes of AeAV from available transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. AeAV appears to transmit vertically and be present in laboratory colonies, wild-caught mosquitoes, and cell lines worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis of AeAV strains indicates that as the A. aegypti mosquito has expanded into the Americas and Asia-Pacific, AeAV has evolved into monophyletic African, American, and Asia-Pacific lineages. The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis restricts positive-sense RNA viruses in A. aegypti. Reanalysis of a small RNA library of A. aegypti cells coinfected with AeAV and Wolbachia produces an abundant RNA interference (RNAi) response consistent with persistent virus replication. We found Wolbachia enhances replication of AeAV compared to a tetracycline-cleared cell line, and AeAV modestly reduces DENV replication in vitro. The results from our study improve understanding of the diversity and evolution of the virome of A. aegypti and adds to previous evidence that shows Wolbachia does not restrict a range of negative-strand RNA viruses. IMPORTANCE The mosquito Aedes aegypti transmits a number of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), such as dengue virus and Zika virus.

TI  - Aedes Mosquito Salivary Components and Their Effect on the Immune Response to Arboviruses
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Vector-borne diseases are responsible for over a billion infections each year and nearly one million deaths. Mosquito-borne dengue virus, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, Chikungunya, and Rift Valley Fever viruses constitute major public health problems in regions with high densities of arthropod vectors. During the initial step of the transmission cycle, vector, host, and virus converge at the bite site, where local immune cells interact with the vector's saliva. Hematophagous mosquito saliva is a mixture of bioactive components known to modulate vertebrate hemostasis, immunity, and inflammation during the insect's feeding process. The capacity of mosquito saliva to modulate the host immune response has been well-studied over the last few decades and has led to the consensus that the presence of saliva is linked to the enhancement of virus transmission, host susceptibility, disease progression, viremia levels, and mortality. We review some of the major aspects of the interactions between mosquito saliva and the host immune response that may be useful for future studies on the control of arboviruses.

TI  - Aedes aegypti (Aag2)-derived clonal mosquito cell lines reveal the effects of pre-existing persistent infection with the insect-specific bunyavirus Phasi Charoen-like virus on arbovirus replication
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 13
AB  - Background Aedes aegypti is a vector mosquito of major public health importance, transmitting arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses. Wild mosquito populations are persistently infected at high prevalence with insect-specific viruses that do not replicate in vertebrate hosts. In experimental settings, acute infections with insect-specific viruses have been shown to modulate arbovirus infection and transmission in Ae. aegypti and other vector mosquitoes. However, the impact of persistent insect-specific virus infections, which arboviruses encounter more commonly in nature, has not been investigated extensively. Cell lines are useful models for studying virus-host interactions, however the available Ae. aegypti cell lines are poorly defined and heterogenous cultures. Methodology/Principle findings We generated single cell-derived clonal cell lines from the commonly used Ae. aegypti cell line Aag2. Two of the fourteen Aag2-derived clonal cell lines generated harboured markedly and consistently reduced levels of the insect-specific bunyavirus Phasi Charoen-like virus (PCLV) known to persistently infect Aag2 cells. In contrast to studies with acute insect-specific virus infections in cell culture and in vivo, we found that pre-existing persistent PCLV infection had no major impact on the replication of the flaviviruses dengue virus and Zika virus, the alphavirus Sindbis virus, or the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus. We also performed a detailed characterisation of the morphology, transfection efficiency and immune status of our Aag2-derived clonal cell lines, and have made a clone that we term Aag2-AF5 available to the research community as a well-defined cell culture model for arbovirus-vector interaction studies. Conclusions/Significance Our findings highlight the need for further in vivo studies that more closely recapitulate natural arbovirus transmission settings in which arboviruses encounter mosquitoes harbouring persistent rather than acute insect-specific virus infections. Furthermore, we provide the well-characterised Aag2-derived clonal cell line as a valuable resource to the arbovirus research community.

In this study, we not only clarified that DENV2 and ZIKV regulate the changes in GNBPB6 expression but also identified the relationship of this gene with viral infections. The changes in GNBPB6 expression were quantified and showed a decrease in A. aegypti cells (Aag2 cells) at 2 dpi and 3 dpi and an increase at 4 dpi and 5 dpi (p < 0.05). A significant increase was observed only at 5 dpi after DENV2 infection. Subsequently, a GNBPB6 knockout (KO) cell line was constructed using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and the DENV2 and ZIKV RNA copies, along with cell densities, were quantified and compared between the KO and wild type (WT) cells at different dpi. The result showed that DENV2 and ZIKV RNA copies were significantly increased in the KO cell line with no significant change in cell growth. Finally, DENV2 copies decreased after GNBPB6 was complemented in the KO. In conclusion, GNBPB6 knockout and complementation in Aag2 cells revealed that GNBPB6 can inhibit the replication of both DENV2 and ZIKV. These results contribute to subsequent research on mosquito–virus interactions.

TI  - Aedes aegypti D7 Saliva Protein Inhibits Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 10
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of several medically relevant arboviruses including dengue virus (DENV) types 1–4. Ae. aegypti transmits DENV by inoculating virus-infected saliva into host skin during probing and feeding. Ae. aegypti saliva contains over one hundred unique proteins and these proteins have diverse functions, including facilitating blood feeding. Previously, we showed that Ae. aegypti salivary gland extracts (SGEs) enhanced dissemination of DENV to draining lymph nodes. In contrast, HPLC-fractionation revealed that some SGE components inhibited infection. Here, we show that D7 proteins are enriched in HPLC fractions that are inhibitory to DENV infection, and that recombinant D7 protein can inhibit DENV infection in vitro and in vivo. Further, binding assays indicate that D7 protein can directly interact with DENV virions and recombinant DENV envelope protein. These data reveal a novel role for D7 proteins, which inhibits arbovirus transmission to vertebrates through a direct interaction with virions.

TI  - Aedes aegypti HPX8C modulates immune responses against viral infection
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 13
AB  - Mosquitoes act as vectors of numerous pathogens that cause human diseases. Dengue virus (DENV) transmitted by mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is responsible for dengue fever epidemics worldwide with a serious impact on human health. Currently, disease control mainly relies on vector targeted intervention strategies. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the innate immune response of mosquitoes against pathogens. In the present study, the expression profiles of immunity-related genes in the midgut responding to DENV infection by feeding were analyzed by transcriptome and quantitative real-time PCR. The level of Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) increased seven days post-infection (d.p.i.), which could be induced by the Toll immune pathway. The expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) genes, including antioxidant genes, such as HPX7, HPX8A, HPX8B, HPX8C were induced at one d.p.i. and peaked again at ten d.p.i. in the midgut. Interestingly, down-regulation of the antioxidant gene HPX8C by RNA interference led to reduction in the virus titer in the mosquito, probably due to the elevated levels of ROS. Application of a ROS inhibitor and scavenger molecules further established the role of oxygen free radicals in the modulation of the immune response to DENV infection. Overall, our comparative transcriptome analyses provide valuable information about the regulation of immunity related genes in the transmission vector in response to DENV infection. It further allows us to identify novel molecular mechanisms underlying the host-virus interaction, which might aid in the development of novel strategies to control mosquito-borne diseases.

TI  - Aedes aegypti Immune Response and Its Potential Impact on Dengue Virus Transmission.
JF  - Viral immunology
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) transmission to human populations requires infection of vector mosquitoes as an essential component of the transmission process. DENV transmission leads to infections that range from asymptomatic to life-threatening pathologies, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Aedes aegypti is the principal vector of DENV, and its vector competence consists of the intrinsic factors, genes, molecules, and pathways that allow infection, replication, and dissemination of this virus throughout the cells of mosquito tissues. In the search for mosquito molecular targets to block DENV transmission, the effect of DENV infection on mosquitoes has been an important focus of research. In this study, we review the findings of research on the effect of DENV infection on mosquito tissue cells and the immunity pathways and molecules that are involved in this infection. We emphasize the relevance of recent findings to understand the relationship between Ae. aegypti immune response, vector competence, and DENV transmission to human hosts.

TI  - Aedes aegypti Mosquito Probing Enhances Dengue Virus Infection of Resident Myeloid Cells in Human Skin
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - The most prevalent arthropod-borne viruses, including the dengue viruses, are primarily transmitted by infected mosquitoes. However, the dynamics of dengue virus (DENV) infection and dissemination in human skin following Aedes aegypti probing remain poorly understood. We exposed human skin explants to adult female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes following their infection with DENV-2 by intrathoracic injection. Skin explants inoculated with a similar quantity of DENV-2 by a bifurcated needle were used as controls. Quantitative in situ imaging revealed that DENV replication was greatest in keratinocytes in the base of the epidermis, accounting for 50–60% of all infected cells regardless of the route of inoculation. However, DENV inoculation by Ae. aegypti probing resulted in an earlier and increased viral replication in the dermis, infecting twice as many cells at 24 h when compared to needle inoculation. Within the dermis, enhanced replication of DENV by Ae. aegypti infected mosquitoes was mediated by increased local recruitment of skin-resident macrophages, dermal dendritic cells, and epidermal Langerhans cells relative to needle inoculation. An enhanced but less pronounced influx of resident myeloid cells to the site of mosquito probing was also observed in the absence of infection. Ae. aegypti probing also increased recruitment and infection of dermal mast cells. Our findings reveal for the first time that keratinocytes are the primary targets of DENV infection following Ae. aegypti inoculation, even though most of the virus is inoculated into the dermis during probing. The data also show that mosquito probing promotes the local recruitment and infection of skin-resident myeloid cells in the absence of an intact vasculature, indicating that influx of blood-derived neutrophils is not an essential requirement for DENV spread within and out of skin.

TI  - Aedes aegypti SNAP and a calcium transporter ATPase influence dengue virus dissemination
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 15
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a flavivirus that causes marked human morbidity and mortality worldwide, being transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Habitat expansion of Aedes, mainly due to climate change and increasing overlap between urban and wild habitats, places nearly half of the world’s population at risk for DENV infection. After a bloodmeal from a DENV-infected host, the virus enters the mosquito midgut. Next, the virus migrates to, and replicates in, other tissues, like salivary glands. Successful viral transmission occurs when the infected mosquito takes another blood meal on a susceptible host and DENV is released from the salivary gland via saliva into the skin. During viral dissemination in the mosquito and transmission to a new mammalian host, DENV interacts with a variety of vector proteins, which are uniquely important during each phase of the viral cycle. Our study focuses on the interaction between DENV particles and protein components in the A. aegypti vector. We performed a mass spectrometry assay where we identified a set of A aegypti salivary gland proteins which potentially interact with the DENV virion. Using dsRNA to silence gene expression, we analyzed the role of these proteins in viral infectivity. Two of these candidates, a synaptosomal-associated protein (AeSNAP) and a calcium transporter ATPase (ATPase) appear to play a role in viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that AeSNAP plays a protective role during DENV infection of mosquitoes and that ATPase protein is required for DENV during amplification within the vector. Importance Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the major vector of different flaviviruses that cause human diseases, including dengue virus. There is a great need for better therapeutics and preventive vaccines against flaviviruses. Flaviviruses create complex virus-host and virus-vector interactions. The interactions between viral particles and protein components in the vector is not completely understood. In this work we characterize how two mosquito proteins, “AeSNAP” and “ATPase”, influence DENV viral dissemination within A. aegypti, using both in vitro and in vivo models. These results elucidate anti-vector measures that may be potentially be used to control dengue virus spread in the mosquito vector.

TI  - Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus microbiome/virome: new strategies for controlling arboviral transmission?
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 15
AB  - Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the main vectors of highly pathogenic viruses for humans, such as dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika (ZIKV), which cause febrile, hemorrhagic, and neurological diseases and remain a major threat to global public health. The high ecological plasticity, opportunistic feeding patterns, and versatility in the use of urban and natural breeding sites of these vectors have favored their dispersal and adaptation in tropical, subtropical, and even temperate zones. Due to the lack of available treatments and vaccines, mosquito population control is the most effective way to prevent arboviral diseases. Resident microorganisms play a crucial role in host fitness by preventing or enhancing its vectorial ability to transmit viral pathogens. High-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analyses have advanced our understanding of the composition and functionality of the microbiota of Aedes spp. Interestingly, shotgun metagenomics studies have established that mosquito vectors harbor a highly conserved virome composed of insect-specific viruses (ISV). Although ISVs are not infectious to vertebrates, they can alter different phases of the arboviral cycle, interfering with transmission to the human host. Therefore, this review focuses on the description of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus as vectors susceptible to infection by viral pathogens, highlighting the role of the microbiota-virome in vectorial competence and its potential in control strategies for new emerging and re-emerging arboviruses.

TI  - Aedes aegypti lachesin protein binds to the domain III of envelop protein of Dengue virus‐2 and inhibits viral replication
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 22
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) comprises of four serotypes (DENV‐1 to ‐4) and is medically one of the most important arboviruses (arthropod‐borne virus). DENV infection is a major human health burden and is transmitted between humans by the insect vector, Aedes aegypti. Ae. aegypti ingests DENV while feeding on infected humans, which traverses through its gut, haemolymph and salivary glands of the mosquito before being injected into a healthy human. During this process of transmission, DENV must interact with many proteins of the insect vector, which are important for its successful transmission. Our study focused on the identification and characterisation of interacting protein partners in Ae. aegypti to DENV. Since domain III (DIII) of envelope protein (E) is exposed on the virion surface and is involved in virus entry into various cells, we performed phage display library screening against domain III of the envelope protein (EDIII) of DENV‐2. A peptide sequence showing similarity to lachesin protein was found interacting with EDIII. The lachesin protein was cloned, heterologously expressed, purified and used for in vitro interaction studies. Lachesin protein interacted with EDIII and also with DENV. Further, lachesin protein was localised in neuronal cells of different organs of Ae. aegypti by confocal microscopy. Blocking of lachesin protein in Ae. aegypti with anti‐lachesin antibody resulted in a significant reduction in DENV replication.

TI  - Aedes albopictus salivary adenosine deaminase is an immunomodulatory factor facilitating dengue virus replication
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 13
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus , is an important vector for the transmission of arboviruses such as dengue virus (DENV). Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is a well-characterized metabolic enzyme involved in facilitating blood feeding and (or) arbovirus transmission in some hematophagous insect species. We previously reported the immunologic function of ADA by investigating its effect on mast cell activation and the interaction with mast cell tryptase and chymase. The 2-D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis in the current study revealed that ADA is present and upregulated following mosquito blood feeding, as confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot. In addition, the recombinant ADA efficiently converted adenosine to inosine. Challenging the Raw264.7 and THP-1 cells with recombinant ADA resulted in the upregulation of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, CCL2, IFN-β, and ISG15. The current study further identified recombinant ADA as a positive regulator in NF-κB signaling targeting TAK1. It was also found that recombinant Ae. albopictus ADA facilitates the replication of DENV-2. Compared with cells infected by DENV-2 alone, the co-incubation of recombinant ADA with DENV-2 substantially increased IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and CCL2 gene transcripts in Raw264.7 and THP-1 cells. However, the expression of IFN-β and ISG15 were markedly downregulated in Raw264.7 cells but upregulated in THP-1 cells. These findings suggest that the immunomodulatory protein, Ae. albopictus ADA is involved in mosquito blood feeding and may modulate DENV transmission via macrophage or monocyte-driven immune response.

TI  - Aedes mosquito salivary immune peptides : boost or block dengue viral infections
AB  - Dengue fevers with its severe clinical manifestations are called dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome. This disease is now endemic in most tropical country zones and emerged as a major public health problem of worldwide concerned because of an increasing potential for mosquito vectors breeding and rapid growth of urban centers with a strain on public services like water containers. Availability of more than 100 countries are endemic for DHF and about 2.5 billion people of the world population are at risks in tropics and sub-tropics. As per estimates, over 50 million infections with about 500 000 cases of DHF have been reported annually, which leads to a cause of childhood mortality in several Asian countries[1-3]. Dengue viruses (DENV) are flaviviruses, which including four serotypes named dengue-1, 2, 3, and 4. The DENV virion is a spherical, enveloped RNA virus that has a diameter of approximately 50 nm. The dengue viral particle contains a lipid bilayer surrounding a capsid that packages the positive-single-strand RNA genome of 10.7 kb in length[4-6].

AB  - Aedes-borne viruses are responsible for high-impact neglected tropical diseases and unpredictable outbreaks such as the ongoing Zika epidemics. Aedes mosquitoes spread different arboviruses such as Dengue virus (DENV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus, among others, and are responsible for the continuous emergence and reemergence of these pathogens. These viruses have complex transmission cycles that include two hosts, namely the Aedes mosquito as a vector and susceptible vertebrate hosts. Human infection with arboviruses causes diseases that range from subclinical or mild to febrile diseases, encephalitis, and hemorrhagic fever. Infected mosquitoes do not show detectable signs of disease, even though the virus maintains a lifelong persistent infection. The infection of the Aedes mosquito by viruses involves a molecular crosstalk between cell and viral proteins. An understanding of how mosquito vectors and viruses interact is of fundamental interest, and it also offers novel perspectives for disease control. In recent years, mass spectrometry (MS)-based strategies in combination with bioinformatics have been successfully applied to identify and quantify global changes in cellular proteins, lipids, peptides, and metabolites in response to viral infection. Although the information about proteomics in the Aedes mosquito is limited, the information that has been reported can set up the basis for future studies. This review reflects how MS-based approaches have extended our understanding of Aedes mosquito biology and the development of DENV and CHIKV infection in the vector. Finally, this review discusses future challenges in the field.

TI  - Afucosylated maternal anti-dengue IgGs are a biomarker for susceptibility to dengue disease in their infants
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Infant mortality from dengue disease is a devastating global health burden that could be minimized with the ability to identify susceptibility for severe disease prior to infection. While most primary infant dengue infections are asymptomatic, maternally derived anti-dengue IgGs present during infection can trigger progression to severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement mechanisms. Importantly, specific characteristics of maternal IgGs that herald progression to severe infant dengue are unknown. Here, we define ≥10% afucosylation of maternal anti-dengue IgGs as a biomarker for susceptibility of infants to symptomatic dengue infections. Mechanistic experiments show that anti-dengue afucosylation, a modification that enhances Fc affinity for the activating receptor FcγRIIIa, promotes infection of FcγRIIIa+ monocytes. FcγRIIIa signaling, in turn, enhances a post-entry step of dengue virus replication. These studies identify a biomarker that can be applied to reduce mortality associated with dengue viruses and define a mechanism by which afucosylated antibodies and FcγRIIIa enhance dengue infections.

TI  - Allergic rhinitis and asthma rather than atopic dermatitis is a protective factor for dengue fever––A nationwide population: A case-control study
JF  - Pediatric Respirology and Critical Care Medicine
VL  - 6
SP  - 39
EP  - 44
AB  - Background/Purpose: Dengue fever (DF) may cause severe morbidity and mortality. Asthma has been proposed as a protective factor for DF. Asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis are atopic diseases with a common background. Herein, we aimed to determine whether allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis are also protective factors for DF, as this aspect remained unknown. Materials and Methods: A resampled nationwide population-based retrospective case-control study was conducted. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent protective factors of these atopic diseases for DF. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to compare dengue-free proportions between patients with or without atopic diseases. Result: This case-control cohort study included a total of 1119 patients with DF and 4476 age- and sex-matched patients without DF. At least one of these atopic diseases was observed in 1322 patients. Compared to patients with DF, the non-DF group had a high prevalence rate of atopic diseases (16.2% vs 25.5%, P <0.001). Both asthma and allergic rhinitis were protective factors for DF with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25–0.65, P<0.001) and 0.48 (95%CI, 0.38–0.61; P<0.001), respectively. Atopic dermatitis was not a protective factor for DF (OR, 0.96; 95%CI, 0.58–1.58; P=0.873). Conclusion: Asthma and allergic rhinitis, rather than atopic dermatitis, can be independent protective factors against DF. Our finding provides insights into the association between allergy and DF.

TI  - Allostery in the dengue virus NS3 helicase: Insights into the NTPase cycle from molecular simulations
JF  - PLoS Computational Biology
VL  - 14
AB  - The C-terminus domain of non-structural 3 (NS3) protein of the Flaviviridae viruses (e.g. HCV, dengue, West Nile, Zika) is a nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) -dependent superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase that unwinds double-stranded RNA while translocating along the nucleic polymer. Due to these functions, NS3 is an important target for antiviral development yet the biophysics of this enzyme are poorly understood. Microsecond-long molecular dynamic simulations of the dengue NS3 helicase domain are reported from which allosteric effects of RNA and NTPase substrates are observed. The presence of a bound single-stranded RNA catalytically enhances the phosphate hydrolysis reaction by affecting the dynamics and positioning of waters within the hydrolysis active site. Coupled with results from the simulations, electronic structure calculations of the reaction are used to quantify this enhancement to be a 150-fold increase, in qualitative agreement with the experimental enhancement factor of 10–100. Additionally, protein-RNA interactions exhibit NTPase substrate-induced allostery, where the presence of a nucleotide (e.g. ATP or ADP) structurally perturbs residues in direct contact with the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA. Residue-residue network analyses highlight pathways of short ranged interactions that connect the two active sites. These analyses identify motif V as a highly connected region of protein structure through which energy released from either active site is hypothesized to move, thereby inducing the observed allosteric effects. These results lay the foundation for the design of novel allosteric inhibitors of NS3.

TI  - Alpha-mannosidase-2 modulates arbovirus infection in a pathogen- and Wolbachia-specific manner in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
JF  - Insect molecular biology
AB  - Multiple Wolbachia strains can block pathogen infection, replication and/or transmission in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes under both laboratory and field conditions. However, Wolbachia effects on pathogens can be highly variable across systems and the factors governing this variability are not well understood. It is increasingly clear that the mosquito host is not a passive player in which Wolbachia governs pathogen transmission phenotypes; rather, the genetics of the host can significantly modulate Wolbachia-mediated pathogen blocking. Specifically, previous work linked variation in Wolbachia pathogen blocking to polymorphisms in the mosquito alpha-mannosidase-2 (αMan2) gene. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to functionally test this association. We developed αMan2 knockouts and examined effects on both Wolbachia and virus levels, using dengue virus (DENV; Flaviviridae) and Mayaro virus (MAYV; Togaviridae). Wolbachia titres were significantly elevated in αMan2 knockout (KO) mosquitoes, but there were complex interactions with virus infection and replication. In Wolbachia-uninfected mosquitoes, the αMan2 KO mutation was associated with decreased DENV titres, but in a Wolbachia-infected background, the αMan2 KO mutation significantly increased virus titres. In contrast, the αMan2 KO mutation significantly increased MAYV replication in Wolbachia-uninfected mosquitoes and did not affect Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking. These results demonstrate that αMan2 modulates arbovirus infection in A. aegypti mosquitoes in a pathogen- and Wolbachia-specific manner, and that Wolbachia-mediated pathogen blocking is a complex phenotype dependent on the mosquito host genotype and the pathogen. These results have a significant impact for the design and use of Wolbachia-based strategies to control vector-borne pathogens.

SP  - 2551
EP  - 62
AB  - Vascular leakage is a hallmark of severe dengue infection. Although extensive studies have been conducted during the past several decades, the molecular mechanisms underlying vascular leakage in dengue shock syndrome (DSS) remain unclear. We thus performed a proteomics study to characterize responses in human endothelial cells (EA.hy926) after DEN-2 virus infection (MOI=10). Comparative 2-D PAGE analysis revealed significantly altered abundance levels of 15 proteins, which were successfully identified by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) and/or tandem MS (MS/MS). These altered proteins were involved in several biological processes, for example, mRNA stability/processing, transcription and translation regulation, molecular chaperoning, oxidative stress response/regulation, cytoskeletal assembly, protein degradation, and cellular metabolisms. We also performed functional analyses of alterations in actin cytoskeletal assembly and endothelial integrity focusing on adherens junction (VE-cadherin), tight junction (ZO-1) and adhesive molecule (PECAM-1) after 24-h of DEN-2 infection and simulation of transendothelial migration by PECAM-1 cross-linking. Decreased expression and disorganization of the actin-cytoskeleton were observed in the infected cells, whereas the increase in actin stress fibers was found in adjacent noninfected cells. Additionally, a decrease in adhesive protein PECAM-1 was observed. Furthermore, DEN-2 infection caused decreased expression and redistribution of both VE-cadherin and ZO-1, whose changes were enhanced by PECAM-1 engagement. These alterations may potentially be a molecular basis explaining increased endothelial permeability or vascular leakage in DSS.

TI  - Alterations in the Aedes aegypti Transcriptome during Infection with West Nile, Dengue and Yellow Fever Viruses
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 7
AB  - West Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV) and yellow fever (YFV) viruses are (re)emerging, mosquito-borne flaviviruses that cause human disease and mortality worldwide. Alterations in mosquito gene expression common and unique to individual flaviviral infections are poorly understood. Here, we present a microarray analysis of the Aedes aegypti transcriptome over time during infection with DENV, WNV or YFV. We identified 203 mosquito genes that were ≥5-fold differentially up-regulated (DUR) and 202 genes that were ≥10-fold differentially down-regulated (DDR) during infection with one of the three flaviviruses. Comparative analysis revealed that the expression profile of 20 DUR genes and 15 DDR genes was quite similar between the three flaviviruses on D1 of infection, indicating a potentially conserved transcriptomic signature of flaviviral infection. Bioinformatics analysis revealed changes in expression of genes from diverse cellular processes, including ion binding, transport, metabolic processes and peptidase activity. We also demonstrate that virally-regulated gene expression is tissue-specific. The overexpression of several virally down-regulated genes decreased WNV infection in mosquito cells and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Among these, a pupal cuticle protein was shown to bind WNV envelope protein, leading to inhibition of infection in vitro and the prevention of lethal WNV encephalitis in mice. This work provides an extensive list of targets for controlling flaviviral infection in mosquitoes that may also be used to develop broad preventative and therapeutic measures for multiple flaviviruses.

TI  - Alterations of pr-M Cleavage and Virus Export in pr-M Junction Chimeric Dengue Viruses
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 2367
EP  - 2381
AB  - ABSTRACT During the export of flavivirus particles through the secretory pathway, a viral envelope glycoprotein, prM, is cleaved by the proprotein convertase furin; this cleavage is required for the subsequent rearrangement of receptor-binding E glycoprotein and for virus infectivity. Similar to many furin substrates, prM in vector-borne flaviviruses contains basic residues at positions P1, P2, and P4 proximal to the cleavage site; in addition, a number of charged residues are found at position P3 and between positions P5 and P13 that are conserved for each flavivirus antigenic complex. The influence of additional charged residues on pr-M cleavage and virus replication was investigated by replacing the 13-amino-acid, cleavage-proximal region of a dengue virus (strain 16681) with those of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and by comparing the resultant chimeric viruses generated from RNA-transfected mosquito cells. Among the three chimeric viruses, cleavage of prM was enhanced to a larger extent in JEVpr/16681 than in YFVpr/16681 but was slightly reduced in TBEVpr/16681. Unexpectedly, JEVpr/16681 exhibited decreased focus size, reduced peak titer, and depressed replication in C6/36, PS, and Vero cell lines. The reduction of JEVpr/16681 multiplication correlated with delayed export of infectious virions out of infected cells but not with changes in specific infectivity. Binding of JEVpr/16681 to immobilized heparin and the heparin-inhibitable infection of cells were not altered. Thus, diverse pr-M junction-proximal sequences of flaviviruses differentially influence pr-M cleavage when tested in a dengue virus prM background. More importantly, greatly enhanced prM cleavability adversely affects dengue virus export while exerting a minimal effect on infectivity. Because extensive changes of charged residues at the pr-M junction, as in JEVpr/16681, were not observed among a large number of dengue virus isolates, these results provide a possible mechanism by which the sequence conservation of the pr-M junction of dengue virus is maintained in nature.

JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 175
SP  - 2676
EP  - 2683
AB  - The interplay of different inflammatory cytokines induced during a dengue (DEN) virus infection plays a role in either protection or increased disease severity. We measured the frequencies and characterized the cytokine responses of DEN virus-specific memory CD4+ T cells in PBMC of six volunteers who received experimental live attenuated monovalent DEN vaccines. IFN-γ and TNF-α responses to inactivated DEN Ags were detected in up to 0.54 and 1.17% of total circulating CD4+ T cells, respectively. Ags from the homologous serotype elicited the highest IFN-γ response. The ratio of TNF-α- to IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells was higher after stimulation with Ags from heterologous DEN serotypes. Peptide-specific CD4+ T cell frequencies of up to 0.089% were detected by direct staining using HLA class II tetramers. IFN-γ and TNF-α responses to individual HLA class II-restricted peptide epitopes were detected in up to 0.05 and 0.27% of CD4+ T cells, respectively. Peptide sequences from the homologous serotype elicited a variety of cytokine response patterns. TNF-α- to IFN-γ-positive CD4+ T cell ratios varied between peptides, but the ratio of the sum of responses was highest against heterologous serotypes. These results demonstrate epitope sequence-specific differences in T cell effector function. These patterns of effector responses may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of DEN hemorrhagic fever.

TI  - Altered m6A modification of specific cellular transcripts affects Flaviviridae infection
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) can modulate mRNA fate and thus affect many biological processes. We analyzed m6A modification across the transcriptome following infection by dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). We found that infection by these viruses in the Flaviviridae family alters m6A modification of specific cellular transcripts, including RIOK3 and CIRBP. During viral infection, the addition of m6A to RIOK3 promotes its translation, while loss of m6A in CIRBP promotes alternative splicing. Importantly, we found that activation of innate immune sensing or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response by viral infection contributes to the changes in m6A modification in RIOK3 and CIRBP, respectively. Further, several transcripts with infection-altered m6A profiles, including RIOK3 and CIRBP, encode proteins that influence DENV, ZIKV, and HCV infection. Overall, this work reveals that cellular signaling pathways activated during viral infection lead to alterations in m6A modification of host mRNAs to regulate infection.

TI  - Alternate Hypothesis on the Pathogenesis of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF)/Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) in Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Experimental Biology and Medicine
VL  - 233
SP  - 401
EP  - 408
AB  - Dengue fever, caused by infection with dengue virus, is not a new disease, but recently because of its serious emerging health threats, coupled with possible dire consequences including death, it has aroused considerable medical and public health concerns worldwide. Today, dengue is considered one of the most important arthropod-borne viral diseases in humans in terms of morbidity and mortality. Globally, it is estimated that approximate 50 to 100 million new dengue virus infections occur annually. Among these, there are 200,000 to 500,000 cases of potential life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS), characterized by thrombocytopenia and increased vascular permeability. The death rate associated with the more severe form DHF/DSS is approximately 5%, predominantly in children under the age of 15. Although intensive efforts have been made to study the early clinical pathophysiology of dengue infection with the objective to identify the potential cause of DHF, results or data that have accumulated from different regions of the world involving studies of different ethnicity groups are inconsistent at present in terms of identifying a unified hypothesis for the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS. Thus, the potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of DHF and DSS remain elusive. The purpose of this review is to identify alternate factors, such as innate immune parameters, hyper-thermal factors, conditioning of neutralizing antibody, concept of vector transmission, and physical status of virus in viremic patients that may play a role in the induction of DHF and DSS, which might have directly or indirectly contributed to the discrepancies that are noted in the literature reported to date. It is the hope that identification of an alternative explanation for the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS will pave the way for the institution of new strategies for the prevention of this complicated disease.

TI  - Alternative Complement Pathway Deregulation Is Correlated with Dengue Severity
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 4
AB  - Background The complement system, a key component that links the innate and adaptive immune responses, has three pathways: the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways. In the present study, we have analyzed the levels of various complement components in blood samples from dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) patients and found that the level of complement activation is associated with disease severity. Methods and Results Patients with DHF had lower levels of complement factor 3 (C3; p = 0.002) and increased levels of C3a, C4a and C5a (p<0.0001) when compared to those with the less severe form, DF. There were no significant differences between DF and DHF patients in the levels of C1q, immunocomplexes (CIC-CIq) and CRP. However, small but statistically significant differences were detected in the levels of MBL. In contrast, the levels of two regulatory proteins of the alternative pathway varied widely between DF and DHF patients: DHF patients had higher levels of factor D (p = 0.01), which cleaves factor B to yield the active (C3bBb) C3 convertase, and lower levels of factor H (p = 0.03), which inactivates the (C3bBb) C3 convertase, than did DF patients. When we considered the levels of factors D and H together as an indicator of (C3bBb) C3 convertase regulation, we found that the plasma levels of these regulatory proteins in DHF patients favored the formation of the (C3bBb) C3 convertase, whereas its formation was inhibited in DF patients (p<0.0001). Conclusion The data suggest that an imbalance in the levels of regulatory factors D and H is associated with an abnormal regulation of complement activity in DHF patients.

TI  - Alternative infectious entry pathways for dengue virus serotypes into mammalian cells
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 11
SP  - 1533
EP  - 1549
AB  - The entry of two dengue virus (DENV) serotypes into Vero cells was analysed using biochemical inhibitors, dominant negative mutants of cellular proteins involved in endocytic pathways, fluorescence microscopy and infectivity determinations. By treatment with dansylcadaverine and chlorpromazine and overexpression of a dominant negative form of the Eps15 protein, a clathrin‐mediated endocytosis for productive DENV‐1 internalization into Vero cells was demonstrated whereas the infectious entry of DENV‐2 in the same cell system was independent of clathrin. Treatment with the inhibitors nystatin and methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin, as well as transfection of Vero cells with dominant negative caveolin‐1, had no effect on DENV‐2 virus infection. It was also shown, by using the K44A mutant and the inhibitor dynasore, that dynamin was required for DENV‐2 entry. Consequently, the infectious entry of DENV‐2 into Vero cells occurs by a non‐classical endocytic pathway independent of clathrin, caveolae and lipid rafts, but dependent on dynamin. By contrast, DENV‐2 entry into A549 cells was clathrin‐dependent, as previously reported in HeLa, C6/36 and BS‐C‐1 cells. Our results conclusively show, for the first time, a differential mode of infective entry for DENV‐1 and DENV‐2 into a common host cell, Vero cells, as well as alternative entry pathways for a given serotype, DENV‐2, into different types of cells.

JF  - Viruses
VL  - 7
SP  - 4119
EP  - 4130
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is an important human pathogen causing millions of disease cases and thousands of deaths worldwide. Non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) is a vital component of the viral replication complex (RC) and plays a major role in the formation of host cell membrane-derived structures that provide a scaffold for replication. The N-terminal cytoplasmic region of NS4A(1–48) is known to preferentially interact with highly curved membranes. Here, we provide experimental evidence for the stable binding of NS4A(1–48) to small liposomes using a liposome floatation assay and identify the lipid binding sequence by NMR spectroscopy. Mutations L6E;M10E were previously shown to inhibit DENV replication and to interfere with the binding of NS4A(1–48) to small liposomes. Our results provide new details on the interaction of the N-terminal region of NS4A with membranes and will prompt studies of the functional relevance of the curvature sensitive membrane anchor at the N-terminus of NS4A.

TI  - An Aedes aegypti-associated fungus increases susceptibility to dengue virus by modulating gut trypsin activity
JF  - eLife
VL  - 6
AB  - Transmission of dengue virus (DENV) requires successful completion of the infection cycle in the Aedes aegypti vector, which is initiated in the midgut tissue after ingestion of an infectious blood meal. While certain Ae. aegypti midgut-associated bacteria influence virus infection, little is known about the midgut-associated fungi (mycobiota), and how its members might influence susceptibility to DENV infection. We show that a Talaromyces (Tsp_PR) fungus, isolated from field-caught Ae. aegypti, render the mosquito more permissive to DENV infection. This modulation is attributed to a profound down-regulation of digestive enzyme genes and trypsin activity, upon exposure to Tsp_PR-secreted factors. In conclusion, we show for the first time that a natural mosquito gut-associated fungus can alter Ae. aegypti physiology in a way that facilitates pathogen infection.

TI  - An External Loop Region of Domain III of Dengue Virus Type 2 Envelope Protein Is Involved in Serotype-Specific Binding to Mosquito but Not Mammalian Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 378
EP  - 388
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DV) is a flavivirus and infects mammalian cells through mosquito vectors. This study investigates the roles of domain III of DV type 2 envelope protein (EIII) in DV binding to the host cell. Recombinant EIII interferes with DV infection to BHK21 and C6/36 cells by blocking dengue virion adsorption to these cells. Inhibition of EIII on BHK21 cells was broad with no serotype specificity; however, inhibition of EIII on C6/36 cells was relatively serotype specific. Soluble heparin completely blocks binding of EIII to BHK21 cells, suggesting that domain III binds mainly to cell surface heparan sulfates. This suggestion is supported by the observation that EIII binds very weakly to gro2C and sog9 mutant mammalian cell lines that lack heparan sulfate. In contrast, heparin does not block binding of EIII to mosquito cells. Furthermore, a synthetic peptide that includes amino acids (aa) 380 to 389 of EIII, IGVEPGQLKL, inhibits binding of EIII to C6/36 but not BHK21 cells. This peptide corresponds to a lateral loop region on domain III of E protein, indicating a possible role of this loop in binding to mosquito cells. In summary, these results suggest that EIII plays an important role in binding of DV type 2 to host cells. In addition, EIII interacts with heparan sulfates when binding to BHK21 cells, and a loop region containing aa 380 to 389 of EIII may participate in DV type 2 binding to C6/36 cells.

TI  - An Integrated Systems Biology Approach Identifies the Proteasome as A Critical Host Machinery for ZIKV and DENV Replication
JF  - Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics
VL  - 19
SP  - 108
EP  - 122
AB  - The Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) flaviviruses exhibit similar replicative processes but distinct clinical outcomes. A systematic understanding of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks can reveal cellular pathways critical to viral replication and disease pathogenesis. Here we employed three independent systems biology approaches toward this goal. First, protein array analysis of direct interactions between individual ZIKV/DENV viral proteins and 20,240 human proteins revealed multiple conserved cellular pathways and protein complexes, including proteasome complexes. Second, an RNAi screen of 10,415 druggable genes to identify host proteins required for ZIKV infection uncovered proteasome proteins. Third, a high-throughput screening of 6,016 bioactive compounds for ZIKV inhibitors yielded 134 effective compounds, including six proteasome inhibitors that suppress both ZIKV and DENV replication. Integrative analyses of these orthogonal datasets pinpoints proteasome as critical host machinery for ZIKV/DENV replication. Our study provides multi-omics datasets for further studies of flavivirus-host interactions, disease pathogenesis, and new drug targets.

AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) causes dengue fever, a major health concern worldwide. We identified an amphipathic helix (AH) in the N-terminal region of the viral nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A). Disruption of its amphipathic nature using mutagenesis reduced homo-oligomerization and abolished viral replication. These data emphasize the significance of NS4A in the life cycle of the dengue virus and demarcate it as a target for the design of novel antiviral therapy.

TI  - An RNA cap (nucleoside‐2′‐O‐)‐methyltransferase in the flavivirus RNA polymerase NS5: crystal structure and functional characterization
JF  - The EMBO Journal
VL  - 21
AB  - Viruses represent an attractive system with which to study the molecular basis of mRNA capping and its relation to the RNA transcription machinery. The RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase NS5 of flaviviruses presents a characteristic motif of S‐adenosyl‐L‐methionine‐dependent methyltransferases at its N‐terminus, and polymerase motifs at its C‐terminus. The crystal structure of an N‐terminal fragment of Dengue virus type 2 NS5 is reported at 2.4 Å resolution. We show that this NS5 domain includes a typical methyltransferase core and exhibits a (nucleoside‐2′‐O‐)‐methyltransferase activity on capped RNA. The structure of a ternary complex comprising S‐adenosyl‐L‐homocysteine and a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) analogue shows that 54 amino acids N‐terminal to the core provide a novel GTP‐binding site that selects guanine using a previously unreported mechanism. Binding studies using GTP‐ and RNA cap‐analogues, as well as the spatial arrangement of the methyltransferase active site relative to the GTP‐binding site, suggest that the latter is a specific cap‐binding site. As RNA capping is an essential viral function, these results provide a structural basis for the rational design of drugs against the emerging flaviviruses.

TI  - An RNAi screen reveals common host-virus gene signatures: implication for anti-viral drug discovery
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease that in recent years has become a major international public health concern. Dengue is a tropical neglected disease with increasing global incidences, affecting millions of people worldwide, and without the availability of specific treatments to combat it. The identification of host-target genes essential for the virus life cycle, for which effective modulators may already exist, would provide an alternative path to a rapid drug development of the much needed anti-Dengue agents. For this purpose, we performed the first genome-wide RNAi screen, combining two high content readouts for DENV infection (FLUO) and host cell toxicity (NUCL), against an arrayed lentiviral based shRNA library covering 16,000 genes with a redundancy of at least 5 hairpins per gene. The screen identified 1,924 gene candidates in total; of which, 1,730 gene candidates abrogated Dengue infection, while 194 gene candidates were found to enhance its infectivity in HEK293 cells. A first pass clustering analysis of hits revealed a well orchestrated gene-network dependency on host cell homeostasis and physiology triggering distinct cellular pathways for infectivity, replication, trafficking and egress; a second analysis revealed a comprehensive gene signature of 331 genes common to hits identified in 28 published RNAi host-viral interactions screens. Taken together, our findings provide novel antiviral molecular targets with the potential for drug discovery and development.

TI  - An emerging role for the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 in dengue virus infection
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 20
AB  - Infection with dengue virus (DENV) causes both mild dengue fever and severe dengue diseases, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The pathogenic mechanisms for DENV are complicated, involving viral cytotoxicity, immunopathogenesis, autoimmunity, and underlying host diseases. Viral load correlates with disease severity, while the antibody-dependent enhancement of infection largely determines the secondary effects of DENV infection. Epidemiological and experimental studies have revealed an association between the plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-10, which is the master anti-inflammatory cytokine, and disease severity in patients with DENV infection. Based on current knowledge of IL-10-mediated immune regulation during infection, researchers speculate an emerging role for IL-10 in clinical disease prognosis and dengue pathogenesis. However, the regulation of dengue pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. This review article discusses the regulation and implications of IL-10 in DENV infection. For future strategies against DENV infection, manipulating IL-10 may be an effective antiviral treatment in addition to the development of a safe dengue vaccine.

JF  - RNA Biology
VL  - 18
SP  - 696
EP  - 708
AB  - ABSTRACT Beyond their high clinical relevance worldwide, flaviviruses (comprising dengue and Zika viruses) are of particular interest to understand the spatiotemporal control of RNA metabolism. Indeed, their positive single-stranded viral RNA genome (vRNA) undergoes in the cytoplasm replication, translation and encapsidation, three steps of the flavivirus life cycle that are coordinated through a fine-tuned equilibrium. Over the last years, RNA methylation has emerged as a powerful mechanism to regulate messenger RNA metabolism at the posttranscriptional level. Not surprisingly, flaviviruses exploit RNA epigenetic strategies to control crucial steps of their replication cycle as well as to evade sensing by the innate immune system. This review summarizes the current knowledge about vRNA methylation events and their impacts on flavivirus replication and pathogenesis. We also address the important challenges that the field of epitranscriptomics faces in reliably and accurately identifying RNA methylation sites, which should be considered in future studies on viral RNA modifications.

TI  - An evolutionary conserved function of the JAK-STAT pathway in anti-dengue defense
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 106
SP  - 17841
EP  - 17846
AB  - Here, we show that the major mosquito vector for dengue virus uses the JAK-STAT pathway to control virus infection. Dengue virus infection in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes activates the JAK-STAT immune signaling pathway. The mosquito's susceptibility to dengue virus infection increases when the JAK-STAT pathway is suppressed through RNAi depletion of its receptor Domeless (Dome) and the Janus kinase (Hop), whereas mosquitoes become more resistant to the virus when the negative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway, PIAS, is silenced. The JAK-STAT pathway exerts its anti-dengue activity presumably through one or several STAT-regulated effectors. We have identified, and partially characterized, two JAK-STAT pathway-regulated and infection-responsive dengue virus restriction factors (DVRFs) that contain putative STAT-binding sites in their promoter regions. Our data suggest that the JAK-STAT pathway is part of the A. aegypti mosquito's anti-dengue defense and may act independently of the Toll pathway and the RNAi-mediated antiviral defenses.

JF  - Indian Journal of Research in Homoeopathy
VL  - 10

EP  - 265
AB  - Background and Objectives: In mosquito vectors, dengue virus (DENV) invasion occurs through midgut cells, but available mosquito cell lines for in vitro study of DENV are prepared from eggs or larvae, which are not appropriate models, to study its infectivity. Hence, we developed a new primary cell culture, from Aedes albopictus mosquito midgut, and standardized it for in vitro study of DENV, with an aim to find out any possible role of homoeopathic medicines, in preventing or reducing DENV invasiveness in these midgut cells. This midgut primary cell culture demonstrated prominent cytopathic effects on infection with wild DENV isolated from dengue-infected patients in viremic phase. Materials and Methods: In this paper, we observed the direct effect of homoeopathic medicine Rhus toxicodendron 6C (Rhus tox 6C) (ultra dilution of 10−12 ) on this primary cell culture, to find out significant changes, to be used as baseline data in future experiments to observe possible role of Rhus tox 6C against DENV infection in these cells. Hence, these direct changes may be a prerequisite for the action of this medicine against DENV invasion; as this is one of common repertoire homoeopathic medicines used against dengue fever. Conclusion and Discussion: In our experiments, we found that Rhus tox 6C could increase cell size and help organization of cells on the solid surface as observed under scanning electron microscope although the total number of cells was decreased. Moreover, Rhus tox 6C treated cells were healthier as indicated by less number of deformed, clump, and diploform cells.

TI  - An update on mosquito cell expressed dengue virus receptor proteins
JF  - Insect Molecular Biology
VL  - 21
AB  - Dengue is the most important mosquito transmitted viral disease of humans worldwide. Despite intensive study over several decades, many of the fine details of the dengue virus (DENV) replication cycle remain unknown, although generally more is known about the phase of the replication cycle in mammalian cells as compared to the phase in mosquito cells. This results from a combination of less research emphasis on the mosquito stage, as well as fewer tools such as specific antibodies against mosquito proteins and insect informatics databases. The binding of a virus to a host cell is a first and critical stage in the infectious process and the mechanism and identity of cellular proteins involved in this process remains largely unknown. This short review aims to provide an update on our current understanding of the proteins expressed by mosquito cells that mediate DENV binding as a prerequisite to DENV entry and replication.

TI  - Analogs of LDL Receptor Ligand Motifs in Dengue Envelope and Capsid Proteins as Potential Codes for Cell Entry.
JF  - Journal of viruses
VL  - 2015
AB  - It is established that cell entry of low density lipoprotein particles (LLPs) containing Apo B100 and Apo E is mediated by receptors and GAGs. Receptor ligand motifs, XBBBXXBX, XBBXBX, and ΨBΨXB, and mono- and bipartite NLS sequences are abundant in Apo E and Apo B100 as well as in envelope and capsid proteins of Dengue viruses 1-4 (DENV1-4). Synthetic, fluorescence-labeled peptides of sequences in DENV2 envelope protein, and DENV3 capsid that include these motifs were used to conduct a qualitative assessment of cell binding and entry capacity using HeLa cells. DENV2 envelope peptide, Dsp2EP, 0564Gly-Gly0595, was shown to bind and remain at the cell surface. In contrast, DENV3 capsid protein peptide, Dsp3CP, 0002Asn-Gln0028, readily enters HeLa cells and accumulates at discrete loci in the nucleus. FITC-labeled dengue synthetic peptides colocalize with Low Density Lipoprotein-CM-DiI and Apo E-CM-DiI to a degree that suggests that Dengue viruses may utilize cell entry pathways used by LLPs.

TI  - Analysis of RNA Binding by the Dengue Virus NS5 RNA Capping Enzyme
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 6
AB  - Flaviviruses are small, capped positive sense RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Dengue virus and other related flaviviruses have evolved RNA capping enzymes to form the viral RNA cap structure that protects the viral genome and directs efficient viral polyprotein translation. The N-terminal domain of NS5 possesses the methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities necessary for forming mature RNA cap structures. The mechanism for flavivirus guanylyltransferase activity is currently unknown, and how the capping enzyme binds its diphosphorylated RNA substrate is important for deciphering how the flavivirus guanylyltransferase functions. In this report we examine how flavivirus NS5 N-terminal capping enzymes bind to the 5′ end of the viral RNA using a fluorescence polarization-based RNA binding assay. We observed that the KD for RNA binding is approximately 200 nM Dengue, Yellow Fever, and West Nile virus capping enzymes. Removal of one or both of the 5′ phosphates reduces binding affinity, indicating that the terminal phosphates contribute significantly to binding. RNA binding affinity is negatively affected by the presence of GTP or ATP and positively affected by S-adensyl methoninine (SAM). Structural superpositioning of the dengue virus capping enzyme with the Vaccinia virus VP39 protein bound to RNA suggests how the flavivirus capping enzyme may bind RNA, and mutagenesis analysis of residues in the putative RNA binding site demonstrate that several basic residues are critical for RNA binding. Several mutants show differential binding to 5′ di-, mono-, and un-phosphorylated RNAs. The mode of RNA binding appears similar to that found with other methyltransferase enzymes, and a discussion of diphosphorylated RNA binding is presented.

EP  - 67
AB  - The initial steps of dengue viral entry have been divided into adsorption and penetration using acid glycine treatment to inactivate extracellular virus after attachment to baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells but prior to penetration. First, we showed that virus infection was accomplished within 2 h after adsorption. Second, the assay was used to examine the properties of dengue envelope E protein-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), lectins, and heparin. We found that three MAbs, 17-2, 46-9, and 51-3, may neutralize dengue 2 virus (DEN-2) through inhibition of not only viral attachment but also of penetration. However, one MAb, 56-3.1, interfered specifically with attachment. Therefore, the functional domains of E protein involved in attachment and penetration may be different. Moreover, studies with lectins indicated that carbohydrates, especially alpha-mannose residues, present on the virion glycoproteins may contribute to binding and penetration of the virus into BHK and mosquito C6/36 cells. Finally, virus infectivity was inhibited by heparin through its blocking effects at both virus attachment and penetration. This suggests that cell surface heparan sulfate functions in both viral attachment and penetration of DEN-2 virus. In conclusion, our results further elucidated some aspects of the dengue virus entry process.

TI  - Analysis of the virus propagation profile of 14 dengue virus isolates in Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells
JF  - BMC Research Notes
VL  - 13
AB  - The mosquito transmitted RNA virus dengue virus (DENV) shows significant variation as a consequence of the lack of proofreading activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that synthesizes new virus genomes. How this variation affects DENV replication, and how this in turn impacts drug development remains largely unknown. Given the technical limitations in working with large numbers of isolates few studies have sought to investigate this area. This study used a panel of 14 DENV isolates of different serotypes and origins to determine how much virus replication in Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells was affected by DENV variability. The results showed that there was considerable variation, with peak titers ranging from 6Log10 to 8Log10, and maximum titer being reached from day 3 to day 9 post infection. While strains from DENV 1 and 4 serotypes showed considerable uniformity, DENV 2 and 3 strains showed much greater variation. Overall, these results show that serotype specific strain variation can have a significant impact on DENV replication, suggesting that studies either investigating DENV pathogenesis or developing drug therapeutics should consider the contribution of DENV variability.

TI  - Anaplerotic Role of Glucose in the Oxidation of Endogenous Fatty Acids during Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - mSphere
VL  - 3
AB  - Dengue virus infection is a major cause of human arbovirosis, for which clinical and experimental evidence supports the idea that liver dysfunction and lipid metabolism disorders are characteristics of severe disease. Analyzing mitochondrial bioenergetics, here we show that infection of hepatic cells with dengue virus favors the cellular capacity of metabolizing glucose, impairing the normal metabolic flexibility that allows the oxidative machinery to switch among the main energetic substrates. However, instead of being used as an energy source, glucose performs an anaplerotic role in the oxidation of endogenous fatty acids, which become the main energetic substrate during infection. Taken together, the results shed light on metabolic mechanisms that may explain the profound alterations in lipid metabolism for severe dengue patients, contributing to the understanding of dengue physiopathology. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is among the most important human arboviruses and is clinically and experimentally associated with lipid metabolism disorders. Using high-resolution respirometry, we analyzed the metabolic switches induced by DENV in a human hepatic cell line. This experimental approach allowed us to determine the contribution of fatty acids, glutamine, glucose, and pyruvate to mitochondrial bioenergetics, shedding light on the mechanisms involved in DENV-induced metabolic alterations. We found that while infection strongly inhibits glutamine oxidation, it increases the cellular capacity of metabolizing glucose; remarkably, though, this substrate, instead being used as an energy source, performs an anaplerotic role in the oxidation of endogenous lipids. Fatty acids become the main energetic substrate in infected cell, and through the pharmacological modulation of β-oxidation we demonstrated that this pathway is essential for virus replication. Interestingly, infected cells were much less susceptible to the Crabtree effect, i.e., the glucose-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, suggesting that infection favors cellular respiration by increasing ADP availability.

JF  - The Journal of Experimental Medicine
VL  - 207
SP  - 793
EP  - 806
AB  - The complement system plays an essential protective role in the initial defense against many microorganisms. Flavivirus NS1 is a secreted nonstructural glycoprotein that accumulates in blood, is displayed on the surface of infected cells, and has been hypothesized to have immune evasion functions. Herein, we demonstrate that dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) NS1 attenuate classical and lectin pathway activation by directly interacting with C4. Binding of NS1 to C4 reduced C4b deposition and C3 convertase (C4b2a) activity. Although NS1 bound C4b, it lacked intrinsic cofactor activity to degrade C4b, and did not block C3 convertase formation or accelerate decay of the C3 and C5 convertases. Instead, NS1 enhanced C4 cleavage by recruiting and activating the complement-specific protease C1s. By binding C1s and C4 in a complex, NS1 promotes efficient degradation of C4 to C4b. Through this mechanism, NS1 protects DENV from complement-dependent neutralization in solution. These studies define a novel immune evasion mechanism for restricting complement control of microbial infection.

TI  - Anti-dengue Vaccines: From Development to Clinical Trials
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue Virus (DENV) is an arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus). Four serotypes of DENV are responsible for the infectious disease called dengue that annually affects nearly 400 million people worldwide. Although there is only one vaccine formulation licensed for use in humans, there are other vaccine formulations under development that apply different strategies. In this review, we present information about anti-dengue vaccine formulations regarding development, pre-clinical tests, and clinical trials. The improvement in vaccine development against dengue is much needed, but it should be considered that the correlate of protection is still uncertain. Neutralizing antibodies have been proposed as a correlate of protection, but this ignores the key role of T-cell mediated immunity in controlling DENV infection. It is important to confirm the accurate correlate of protection against DENV infection, and also to have other anti-dengue vaccine formulations licensed for use.

 The anti-dengue immunoglobulins present in the sera of 12 children with dengue shock syndrome were studied by immunochemical and serologic methods. IgG antibody was shown to have HI, CF and N activity against dengue viruses. No anti-dengue antibody activity was attributable to IgA or IgM in these patients, all of whom had secondary dengue infections. A depression in serum β1 c/a globulin levels was observed in 23 dengue shock syndrome patients during the shock phase of the illness. Normal levels were found following convalescence. The significance of these observations with respect to possible immunologic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the dengue shock syndrome is discussed.

JF  - Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics
VL  - 40

EP  - 11404
AB  - Abstract The traffic of molecules into or out of cells is regulated by many membrane-associated mechanisms. Membrane pores are considered as one of the major passage mechanisms, although molecular-level understanding of pore formation is still vague. The opening of a membrane pore depends on many factors, including the influence of some proteins. The ability of the cell-penetrating peptides and supercharged proteins to form membrane pores has been reported. We studied pore formation through dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid bilayers by supercharged dengue virus capsid (C) protein. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the formation of membrane pores by a combined effect of the C protein and the membrane electric field. Analyses of simulated trajectories showed highly correlated vertical position fluctuations between the Cα atom of the membrane-anchored arginine residues and the phosphorus atoms of the surrounding DPPC lipids. Certain regions of the bilayer were negatively correlated while the others were positively correlated with respect to the fluctuations of the Cα atom of the anchored arginine residues. When positively correlated lipids in one leaflet vertically aligned with the negatively correlated lipids in the other leaflet, a local anticorrelated region was generated by weakening the bilayer. The membrane pore was always formed close to this anticorrelated region. Once formed, the C protein followed the hydrated pathway provided by the water-filled pores to cross the membrane.

TI  - Antiplatelet autoantibodies elicited by dengue virus non‐structural protein 1 cause thrombocytopenia and mortality in mice
JF  - Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis
VL  - 5
AB  - Background: The mechanisms responsible for thrombocytopenia associated with dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhage fever (DHF) remain unclear. Objective: In this study, we investigated the pathogenic effects of dengue virus (DENV) non‐structural protein 1 (NS1) on the elicitation of platelet cross‐reactive antibodies. Results: The results showed that anti‐DENV NS1 immunoglobulins (Igs) derived from both patients with DF/DHF and recombinant NS1‐immunized rabbits could opsonize normal human platelets and enhance platelet–macrophage engagements in vitro. In addition, treatments with anti‐NS1 Igs abnormally activated human platelets and induced thrombocytopenia in mice. These prothrombotic characteristics of anti‐NS1 Ig might increase the disease burden of coagulant‐aberrant DHF patients. To test this hypothesis, we injected anti‐NS1 Igs into C57BL/6J mice that were preconditioned into a hypercoagulable state by warfarin treatments. When given before but not after platelet‐lysate pre‐adsorption, the anti‐NS1 Igs injection treatments significantly increased mortality, fibrin deposition in lung, and plasma D‐dimer levels, but significantly decreased anticoagulant proteins C, protein S and antithrombin III. Conclusions: These results suggest that the platelet‐bound antibody fractions of anti‐NS1 Ig are prothrombotic, which might exacerbate the severity of disease in hosts with an imbalanced coagulant system.

TI  - Antiviral RNAi Mechanisms to Arboviruses in Mosquitoes: microRNA Profile of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus from Grenada, West Indies
JF  - Applied Microbiology
AB  - Mosquito-borne arboviruses, such as dengue virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus and yellow fever virus, impose a tremendous cost on the health of populations around the world. As a result, much effort has gone into the study of the impact of these viruses on human infections. Comparatively less effort, however, has been made to study the way these viruses interact with mosquitoes themselves. As ingested arboviruses infect their midgut and subsequently other tissue, the mosquito mounts a multifaceted innate immune response. RNA interference, the central intracellular antiviral defense mechanism in mosquitoes and other invertebrates can be induced and modulated through outside triggers (small RNAs) and treatments (transgenesis or viral-vector delivery). Accordingly, modulation of this facet of the mosquito’s immune system would thereby suggest a practical strategy for vector control. However, this requires a detailed understanding of mosquitoes’ endogenous small RNAs and their effects on the mosquito and viral proliferation. This paper provides an up-to-date overview of the mosquito’s immune system along with novel data describing miRNA profiles for Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasiatus in Grenada, West Indies.

TI  - Antiviral Wolbachia strains associate with Aedes aegypti endoplasmic reticulum membranes and induce lipid droplet formation to restrict dengue virus replication
JF  - mBio
VL  - 15
AB  - ABSTRACT Wolbachia are a genus of insect endosymbiotic bacteria which includes strains wMel and wAlbB that are being utilized as a biocontrol tool to reduce the incidence of Aedes aegypti-transmitted viral diseases like dengue. However, the precise mechanisms underpinning the antiviral activity of these Wolbachia strains are not well defined. Here, we generated a panel of Ae. aegypti-derived cell lines infected with antiviral strains wMel and wAlbB or the non-antiviral Wolbachia strain wPip to understand host cell morphological changes specifically induced by antiviral strains. Antiviral strains were frequently found to be entirely wrapped by the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, while wPip bacteria clustered separately in the host cell cytoplasm. ER-derived lipid droplets (LDs) increased in volume in wMel- and wAlbB-infected cell lines and mosquito tissues compared to cells infected with wPip or Wolbachia-free controls. Inhibition of fatty acid synthase (required for triacylglycerol biosynthesis) reduced LD formation and significantly restored ER-associated dengue virus replication in cells occupied by wMel. Together, this suggests that antiviral Wolbachia strains may specifically alter the lipid composition of the ER to preclude the establishment of dengue virus (DENV) replication complexes. Defining Wolbachia’s antiviral mechanisms will support the application and longevity of this effective biocontrol tool that is already being used at scale. IMPORTANCE Aedes aegypti transmits a range of important human pathogenic viruses like dengue. However, infection of Ae. aegypti with the insect endosymbiotic bacterium, Wolbachia, reduces the risk of mosquito to human viral transmission. Wolbachia is being utilized at field sites across more than 13 countries to reduce the incidence of viruses like dengue, but it is not well understood how Wolbachia induces its antiviral effects. To examine this at the subcellular level, we compared how different strains of Wolbachia with varying antiviral strengths associate with and modify host cell structures. Strongly antiviral strains were found to specifically associate with the host endoplasmic reticulum and induce striking impacts on host cell lipid droplets. Inhibiting Wolbachia-induced lipid redistribution partially restored dengue virus replication demonstrating this is a contributing role for Wolbachia's antiviral activity. These findings provide new insights into how antiviral Wolbachia strains associate with and modify Ae. aegypti host cells.

JF  - The Indian Journal of Medical Research
VL  - 138
SP  - 632
EP  - 647
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are a major current and emerging threat, affecting millions of people worldwide. Global climate change, combined with increasing proximity of humans to animals and mosquito vectors by expansion into natural habitats, coupled with the increase in international travel, have resulted in significant spread and concomitant increase in the incidence of infection and severe disease. Although neuroinvasive disease has been well described for some viral infections such as Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV), others such as dengue virus (DENV) have recently displayed an emerging pattern of neuroinvasive disease, distinct from the previously observed, systemically-induced encephalomyelopathy. In this setting, the immune response is a crucial component of host defence, in preventing viral dissemination and invasion of the central nervous system (CNS). However, subversion of the anti-viral activities of macrophages by flaviviruses can facilitate viral replication and spread, enhancing the intensity of immune responses, leading to severe immune-mediated disease which may be further exacerbated during the subsequent infection with some flaviviruses. Furthermore, in the CNS myeloid cells may be responsible for inducing specific inflammatory changes, which can lead to significant pathological damage during encephalitis. The interaction of virus and cells of the myeloid lineage is complex, and this interaction is likely responsible at least in part, for crucial differences between viral clearance and pathology. Recent studies on the role of myeloid cells in innate immunity and viral control, and the mechanisms of evasion and subversion used by flaviviruses are rapidly advancing our understanding of the immunopathological mechanisms involved in flavivirus encephalitis and will lead to the development of therapeutic strategies previously not considered.

TI  - ApoA1 Neutralizes Proinflammatory Effects of Dengue Virus NS1 Protein and Modulates Viral Immune Evasion
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - DENV is one of the most relevant mosquito-transmitted viruses worldwide, infecting more than 390 million people every year and leading to more than 20 thousand deaths. Although a DENV vaccine has already been approved, its potential side effects have hampered its use in large-scale immunizations. ABSTRACT Dengue is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that is highly endemic in tropical and subtropical countries. Symptomatic patients can rapidly progress to severe conditions of hemorrhage, plasma extravasation, and hypovolemic shock, which leads to death. The blood tests of patients with severe dengue typically reveal low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is responsible for reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and regulation of the lipid composition in peripheral tissues. It is well known that dengue virus (DENV) depends on membrane cholesterol rafts to infect and to replicate in mammalian cells. Here, we describe the interaction of DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) with apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), which is the major protein component of HDL. NS1 is secreted by infected cells and can be found circulating in the serum of patients with the onset of symptoms. NS1 concentrations in plasma are related to dengue severity, which is attributed to immune evasion and an acute inflammatory response. Our data show that the DENV NS1 protein induces an increase of lipid rafts in noninfected cell membranes and enhances further DENV infection. We also show that ApoA1-mediated lipid raft depletion inhibits DENV attachment to the cell surface. In addition, ApoA1 is able to neutralize NS1-induced cell activation and to prevent NS1-mediated enhancement of DENV infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ApoA1 mimetic peptide 4F is also capable of mediating lipid raft depletion to control DENV infection. Taken together, our results suggest the potential of RCT-based therapies for dengue treatment. These results should motivate studies to assess the importance of RCT in DENV infection in vivo. IMPORTANCE DENV is one of the most relevant mosquito-transmitted viruses worldwide, infecting more than 390 million people every year and leading to more than 20 thousand deaths. Although a DENV vaccine has already been approved, its potential side effects have hampered its use in large-scale immunizations. Therefore, new treatment options are urgently needed to prevent disease worsening or to improve current clinical management of severe cases. In this study, we describe a new interaction of the NS1 protein, one of the major viral components, with a key component of HDL, ApoA1. This interaction seems to alter membrane susceptibility to virus infection and modulates the mechanisms triggered by DENV to evade the immune response. We also propose the use of a mimetic peptide named 4F, which was originally developed for atherosclerosis, as a potential therapy for relieving DENV symptoms.

TI  - Apolipoproteins and Its Association with Dengue Virus Serotype 2 (DENV-2) Infectivity in Human Hepatoma Cell Line (Huh7)
JF  - Trends in Sciences
AB  - Introduction: Previous studies have shown that lipid components are involved in the internalization of Dengue virus (DENV), however, this mechanism has been hypothesized mostly through clinical studies correlating between dengue severity and lipid levels. This study aimed to determine DENV-2 internalization in the presence of apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), B (apoB) or E (apoE) in human hepatoma cell line (Huh7). Materials and methods: Tetrazolium reduction assays were used to assess the cytotoxicity of apolipoproteins on Huh7. DENV-2 at MOI of 1 with 2 µg/mL apoA1, apoB and apoE, respectively were introduced into the confluent Huh7 cells and incubated for an hour (internalization) and 72 h (replication) at 37 °C, 5 % CO2. The replication experiments were repeated after SR-B1 siRNA treatment. Samples collected were subjected to qPCR for viral load determination. Differences between groups were assessed by ANOVA and independent T-Test. Results and discussion: Treatment with apoA1 and apoB demonstrated significant increment in DENV-2 internalization and replication compared to apoE (internalization: p = 0.022 and p = 0.323 vs p = 0.878, respectively; replication: p = 0.004 and p = 0.016 vs p = 0.897, respectively). A significant reduction of DENV2 infectivity was seen in apoA1 treated cells with SR-B1 down-regulation/silencing (35.2 % reduction, p = 0.013). Conclusions: apoA1 and apoB, enhanced initial attachment of DENV-2 to cell surface, suggesting their role in DENV internalization and infectivity.
HIGHLIGHTS

This research determined the effects of apolipoproteins on dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) internalization in vitro using the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7)
apoA1 and apoB enhance the initial attachment of DENV-2 to the cell surface
Knockdown of SR-B1 receptors reduces apoA1-treated DENV-2 internalization, suggesting the role of SR-B1 as a route of entry for DENV-2
Knockdown of SR-B1 receptors had no effect on apoB-treated DENV-2 internalization, suggesting it uses another entry pathway

TI  - Apoptosis in dengue virus infected liver cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 72
AB  - While both in vivo and in vitro evidence has suggested that liver cells undergo apoptosis in response to dengue virus infection, little is known about the mechanism of induction. Given that the p53 tumour suppressor gene is a key mediator of apoptosis, we sought to define the role of this gene in response to dengue virus infection. After infection, a p53 wild type liver cell line (HepG2) showed changes consistent with apoptosis including alterations of cell morphology, cellular detachment and DNA laddering. However, p53 was neither up‐regulated, nor showed any evidence of complexing with dengue virus proteins as determined by immunoprecipitation. Infection of a p53 null liver cell line (Hep3B) also produced changes consistent with the induction of apoptosis. While the profile of the cells undergoing apoptosis in each cell line was similar as determined by flow cytometry, the absolute levels were markedly different with up to 90% of Hep3B cells undergoing apoptosis compared to only 20% of HepG2 cells at day 5 post infection. By day 7, all Hep3B infected cells were dead. In contrast, it proved possible to culture dengue virus infected HepG2 cells for 3 months. Viral progeny released from the p53 null cell line were nine‐fold higher per attached cell than from the p53 wild type cell line. These results suggest that, while induction of apoptosis in liver cells is mediated by a non‐p53 regulated pathway, p53 may play a role in restricting the level of viral progeny to below a critical level at which apoptosis is triggered.

JF  - Journal of Virology

EP  - 829
AB  - ABSTRACT Apoptosis has been suggested as a mechanism by which dengue (DEN) virus infection may cause neuronal cell death (P. Desprès, M. Flamand, P.-E. Ceccaldi, and V. Deubel, J. Virol. 70:4090–4096, 1996). In this study, we investigated whether apoptotic cell death occurred in the central nervous system (CNS) of neonatal mice inoculated intracerebrally with DEN virus. We showed that serial passage of a wild-type human isolate of DEN virus in mouse brains selected highly neurovirulent variants which replicated more efficiently in the CNS. Infection of newborn mice with these neurovirulent variants produced fatal encephalitis within 10 days after inoculation. Virus-induced cell death and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation were observed in mouse brain tissue by day 9. Infected mouse brain tissue was assayed for apoptosis by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and for virus replication by immunostaining of viral antigens and in situ hybridization. Apoptotic cell death and DEN virus replication were restricted to the neurons of the cortical and hippocampal regions. Thus, DEN virus-induced apoptosis in the CNS was a direct result of virus infection. In the murine neuronal cell line Neuro 2a, neuroadapted DEN virus variants showed infection patterns similar to those of the parental strain. However, DEN virus-induced apoptosis in these cells was more pronounced after infection with the neurovirulent variants than after infection with the parental strain.

TI  - Appraising the Roles of CBLL1 and the Ubiquitin/Proteasome System for Flavivirus Entry and Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 2980
EP  - 2989
AB  - ABSTRACT The ubiquitin ligase CBLL1 (also known as HAKAI) has been proposed to be a critical cellular factor exploited by West Nile virus (WNV) for productive infection. CBLL1 has emerged as a major hit in a recent RNA interference screen designed to identify cellular factors required for the early stages of the WNV life cycle. Follow-up experiments showed that HeLa cells knocked down for CBLL1 by a small interfering RNA (siRNA) failed to internalize WNV particles and resisted infection. Furthermore, depletion of a free-ubiquitin pool by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 abolished WNV endocytosis, suggesting that CBLL1 acts in concert with the ubiquitin proteasome system to mediate virus internalization. Here, we examined the effect of CBLL1 knockdown and proteasome inhibitors on infection by WNV and other flaviviruses. We identified new siRNAs that repress the CBLL1 protein and strongly inhibit the endocytosis of Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterial pathogen known to require CBLL1 to invade host cells. Strikingly, however, we detected efficient WNV, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus infection of human cells, despite potent downregulation of CBLL1 by RNA interference. In addition, we found that the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin did not affect WNV internalization but strongly repressed flavivirus RNA translation and replication. Together, these data do not support a requirement for CBLL1 during flavivirus entry and rather suggest an essential role of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway for flavivirus genome amplification.

TI  - Arbovirus-vector protein interactomics identifies Loquacious as a co-factor for dengue virus replication in Aedes mosquitoes
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 18
AB  - Efficient virus replication in Aedes vector mosquitoes is essential for the transmission of arboviral diseases such as dengue virus (DENV) in human populations. Like in vertebrates, virus-host protein-protein interactions are essential for viral replication and immune evasion in the mosquito vector. Here, 79 mosquito host proteins interacting with DENV non-structural proteins NS1 and NS5 were identified by label-free mass spectrometry, followed by a functional screening. We confirmed interactions with host factors previously observed in mammals, such as the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, and we identified protein-protein interactions that seem to be specific for mosquitoes. Among the interactors, the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein Loquacious (Loqs), an RNA interference (RNAi) cofactor, was found to be essential for efficient replication of DENV and Zika virus (ZIKV) in mosquito cells. Loqs did not affect viral RNA stability or translation of a DENV replicon and its proviral activity was independent of its RNAi regulatory activity. Interestingly, Loqs colocalized with DENV dsRNA in viral replication organelles in infected cells and directly interacted with high affinity with DENV RNA in the 3’ untranslated region in vitro (KD = 100-200 nM). Our study provides an interactome for DENV NS1 and NS5 and identifies Loqs as a key proviral host factor in mosquitoes. We propose that DENV hijacks a factor of the RNAi mechanism for replication of its own RNA. AUTHOR SUMMARY Dengue virus is a mosquito-transmitted virus endemic to the tropics and subtropics, affecting an estimated 390 million people yearly. While the mechanisms of infection, pathogenesis and immune evasion have been extensively studied in humans, replication in Aedes mosquitoes has received much less attention, despite being a critical step in the arbovirus transmission cycle. Here, we used a proteomic approach to identify Aedes mosquito proteins recruited by dengue virus non- structural proteins NS1 and NS5. In addition to previously established host proteins that interact with DENV in mammals, we identified Loquacious, a double-stranded RNA binding protein involved in the antiviral RNAi immune response of mosquitoes. Unexpectedly, our data showed Loquacious functions as a proviral factor that is recruited to replication organelles to facilitate viral RNA replication. We propose that DENV exploits host immune components, such as Loquacious, for its own benefit.

AB  - Flavivirus infection causes extensive proliferation and reorganization of host cell membranes to form specialized structures called convoluted membranes/paracrystalline arrays and vesicle packets (VP), the latter of which is believed to harbor flaviviral replication complexes. Using detergents and trypsin and micrococcal nuclease, we provide for the first time biochemical evidence for a double membrane compartment that encloses the replicative form (RF) RNA of the three pathogenic flaviviruses West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue viruses. The bounding membrane enclosing the VP was readily solubilized with nonionic detergents, rendering the catalytic amounts of enzymatically active protein component(s) of the replicase machinery partially sensitive to trypsin but allowing limited access for nucleases only to the vRNA and single-stranded tails of the replicative intermediate RNA. The RF co-sedimented at high speed from nonionic detergent extracts of virus-induced heavy membrane fractions along with the released individual inner membrane vesicles whose size of 75–100 nm as well as association with viral NS3 was revealed by immunoelectron microscopy. Viral RF remained nuclease-resistant even after ionic detergents solubilized the more refractory inner VP membrane. All of the viral RNA species became nuclease-sensitive following membrane disruption only upon prior trypsin treatment, suggesting that proteins coat the viral genomic RNA as well as RF within these membranous sites of flaviviral replication. These results collectively demonstrated that the newly formed viral genomic RNA associated with the VP are oriented outwards, while the RF is located inside the nonionic detergent-resistant vesicles.

JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 111
SP  - E2915
EP  - E2916
AB  - An article in PNAS by Hussain and Asgari (1) suggests that a viral small RNA (vsRNA) from the 3′ UTR of the Dengue virus (DENV) genome is important for the autoregulation of the viral replication in mosquito cells by acting as a microRNA (miRNA) targeting the NS1 region of the genome. The authors performed a sequence conservation analysis on the vsRNA-5 across the four serotypes. Unfortunately, the analysis was carried out using only one sequence from each serotype, which in the case of a genome segment from the variable region of the 3′ UTR may misrepresent the total virus diversity and, thus, its interpretation may be misleading.

TI  - Arthropod EVs mediate dengue virus transmission through interaction with a tetraspanin domain containing glycoprotein Tsp29Fb
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 115

EP  - E6613
AB  - Significance So far, no studies have reported whether dengue virus uses arthropod extracellular vesicles (EVs) for its transmission from vector to the mammalian host. Our study reports a very significant finding on EV-mediated transmission of dengue viruses (serotypes 2 and 3) from mosquito to mammalian, including human cells, through interactions with an arthropod EV-enriched tetraspanin domain-containing glycoprotein, Tsp29Fb. Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes dengue fever in humans, worldwide. Using in vitro cell lines derived from Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti, the primary vectors of DENV, we report that DENV2/DENV3-infected cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, containing infectious viral RNA and proteins. A full-length DENV2 genome, detected in arthropod EVs, was infectious to naïve mosquito and mammalian cells, including human-skin keratinocytes and blood endothelial cells. Cryo-electron microscopy showed mosquito EVs with a size range from 30 to 250 nm. Treatments with RNase A, Triton X-100, and 4G2 antibody-bead binding assays showed that infectious DENV2-RNA and proteins are contained inside EVs. Viral plaque formation and dilution assays also showed securely contained infectious viral RNA and proteins in EVs are transmitted to human cells. Up-regulated HSP70 upon DENV2 infection showed no role in viral replication and transmission through EVs. In addition, qRT-PCR and immunoblotting results revealed that DENV2 up-regulates expression of a mosquito tetraspanin-domain–containing glycoprotein, designated as Tsp29Fb, in A. aegypti mosquitoes, cells, and EVs. RNAi-mediated silencing and antibody blocking of Tsp29Fb resulted in reduced DENV2 loads in both mosquito cells and EVs. Immunoprecipitation showed Tsp29Fb to directly interact with DENV2 E-protein. Furthermore, treatment with GW4869 (exosome-release inhibitor) affected viral burden, direct interaction of Tsp29Fb with E-protein and EV-mediated transmission of viral RNA and proteins to naïve human cells. In summary, we report a very important finding on EV-mediated transmission of DENV2 from arthropod to mammalian cells through interactions with an arthropod EVs-enriched marker Tsp29Fb.

AB  - Arthropods, especially ticks and mosquitoes, are the vectors for a number of parasitic and viral human diseases, including malaria, sleeping sickness, Dengue, and Zika, yet arthropods show tremendous individual variation in their capacity to transmit disease. A key factor in this capacity is the group of genetically encoded immune factors that counteract infection by the pathogen. Arthropod-specific pattern recognition receptors and protease cascades detect and respond to infection. Proteins such as antimicrobial peptides, thioester-containing proteins, and transglutaminases effect responses such as lysis, phagocytosis, melanization, and agglutination. Effector responses are initiated by damage signals such as reactive oxygen species signaling from epithelial cells and recognized by cell surface receptors on hemocytes. Antiviral immunity is primarily mediated by siRNA pathways but coupled with interferon-like signaling, antimicrobial peptides, and thioester-containing proteins. Molecular mechanisms of immunity are closely linked to related traits of longevity and fertility, and arthropods have the capacity for innate immunological memory. Advances in understanding vector immunity can be leveraged to develop novel control strategies for reducing the rate of transmission of both ancient and emerging threats to global health.

TI  - Assembly of the Genome of the Disease Vector Aedes aegypti onto a Genetic Linkage Map Allows Mapping of Genes Affecting Disease Transmission
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 8
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti transmits some of the most important human arboviruses, including dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses. It has a large genome containing many repetitive sequences, which has resulted in the genome being poorly assembled — there are 4,758 scaffolds, few of which have been assigned to a chromosome. To allow the mapping of genes affecting disease transmission, we have improved the genome assembly by scoring a large number of SNPs in recombinant progeny from a cross between two strains of Ae. aegypti, and used these to generate a genetic map. This revealed a high rate of misassemblies in the current genome, where, for example, sequences from different chromosomes were found on the same scaffold. Once these were corrected, we were able to assign 60% of the genome sequence to chromosomes and approximately order the scaffolds along the chromosome. We found that there are very large regions of suppressed recombination around the centromeres, which can extend to as much as 47% of the chromosome. To illustrate the utility of this new genome assembly, we mapped a gene that makes Ae. aegypti resistant to the human parasite Brugia malayi, and generated a list of candidate genes that could be affecting the trait.

TI  - Assessing Aedes aegypti candidate genes during viral infection and Wolbachia‐mediated pathogen blocking
JF  - Insect Molecular Biology
VL  - 31
SP  - 356
EP  - 368
AB  - One approach to control dengue virus transmission is the symbiont Wolbachia, which limits viral infection in mosquitoes. Despite plans for its widespread use in Aedes aegypti, Wolbachia's mode of action remains poorly understood. Many studies suggest that the mechanism is likely multifaceted, involving aspects of immunity, cellular stress and nutritional competition. A previous study from our group used artificial selection to identify a new mosquito candidate gene related to viral blocking; alpha‐mannosidase‐2a (alpha‐Mann‐2a) with a predicted role in protein glycosylation. Protein glycosylation pathways tend to be involved in complex host–viral interactions; however, the function of alpha‐mannosidases has not been described in mosquito–virus interactions. We examined alpha‐Mann‐2a expression in response to virus and Wolbachia infections and whether reduced gene expression, caused by RNA interference, affected viral loads. We show that dengue virus (DENV) infection affects the expression of alpha‐Mann‐2a in a tissue‐ and time‐dependent manner, whereas Wolbachia infection had no effect. In the midgut, DENV prevalence increased following knockdown of alpha‐Mann‐2a expression in Wolbachia‐free mosquitoes, suggesting that alpha‐Mann‐2a interferes with infection. Expression knockdown had the same effect on the togavirus chikungunya virus, indicating that alpha‐Mann‐2a may have broad antivirus effects in the midgut. Interestingly, we were unable to knockdown the expression in Wolbachia‐infected mosquitoes. We also provide evidence that alpha‐Mann‐2a may affect the transcriptional level of another gene predicted to be involved in viral blocking and cell adhesion; cadherin87a. These data support the hypothesis that glycosylation and adhesion pathways may broadly be involved in viral infection in Ae. aegypti.

TI  - Assessing the Potential Interactions between Cellular miRNA and Arboviral Genomic RNA in the Yellow Fever Mosquito, Aedes aegypti
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - Although the role of exogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA) and P-element induced wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathways in mosquito antiviral immunity is increasingly better understood, there is still little knowledge regarding the role of mosquito cellular microRNA (miRNA). Identifying direct interactions between the mosquito miRNAs and the RNA genome of arboviruses and choosing the relevant miRNA candidates to explore resulting antiviral mechanisms are critical. Here, we carried out genomic analyses to identify Aedes aegypti miRNAs that potentially interact with various lineages and genotypes of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses. By using prediction tools with distinct algorithms, several miRNA binding sites were commonly found within different genotypes/and or lineages of each arbovirus. We further analyzed those miRNAs that could target more than one arbovirus, required a low energy threshold to form miRNA-viralRNA (vRNA) complexes, and predicted potential RNA structures using RNAhybrid software. We predicted miRNA candidates that might participate in regulating arboviral replication in Ae. aegypti. Even without any experimental validation, which should be done as a next step, this study can shed further light on the role of miRNA in mosquito innate immunity and targets for future studies.

TI  - Assessment of the association of ABO blood group in dengue fever diagnosed patient in tertiary care hospital.
JF  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENDORSING HEALTH SCIENCE RESEARCH (IJEHSR)
AB  - Background: A serious worldwide medical and public health concern occurs with the dengue virus, which is also an emerging health threat. A victim can be vulnerable and acquire dengue because of his age, genetics, nutritional status, viral strain and secondary infections. Our objective was to identify the ABO blood group system's distribution and relationship in dengue fever (DF) patients. Methodology: The current study was conducted at Dr. Ishrat ul Ebad Institute of Blood Diseases Department between September 2019 and September 2020. The research work was viewed and accepted by the ethics and research committees. Case records of patients with blood systems and their relation among dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen /dengue immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (lgG) were included in this study. Results: Among 204 cases, 82 were blood group O positive, 59 were B positive, 38 were A positive, 16 were AB positive, 4 were O negative, and 2 were blood group A negative. The association of the ABO blood group with dengue was statistically significant (p=0.046). Blood group O+ has the highest number of cases, 66 (42.9%), than controls, 16 (32%). Conclusion: This study overall consummates that blood group O is linked with a greater possibility of acquiring DF in comparison with different other blood group types. There is a significant relationship between blood group and DF observed.

TI  - Association between NS3 and NS5 Proteins of Dengue Virus Type 2 in the Putative RNA Replicase Is Linked to Differential Phosphorylation of NS5 (*)
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 270
SP  - 19100
EP  - 19106
AB  - Dengue virus type 2, a member of the family Flaviviridae, encodes a single polyprotein precursor consisting of 3391 amino acid residues that is processed to at least 10 mature proteins by host and viral proteases. The NS3 protein contains a domain commonly found in cellular serine proteinases that in cooperation with NS2B is involved in polyprotein processing. In addition, NS3 and NS5 proteins contain conserved motifs found in several RNA helicases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, respectively. Both enzymatic activities have been suggested to be involved in viral RNA replication. In this report, we demonstrate that the NS3 and NS5 proteins interact in vivo in dengue virus type 2-infected monkey kidney (CV-1) cells and in HeLa cells coinfected with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding these proteins as shown by coimmunoprecipitations and immunoblotting methods. We also show by immunofluorescence, metabolic labeling, and two-dimensional peptide mapping that NS5 is a nuclear phosphoprotein and that phosphorylation occurs on serine residues at multiple sites. Furthermore, NS5 exists in differentially phosphorylated states in the nuclear and the cytoplasmic fractions, and only the cytoplasmic form of NS5 is found to coimmunoprecipitate with NS3, suggesting that differential phosphorylation may control the interaction between these proteins and its function in the viral RNA replicase.

AB  - Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune‐related genes have been shown to play a role in driving the development of the severe phenotypes of dengue virus (DENV) infection. We assessed the association between IFNL3 gene SNP (rs12979860) and dengue clinical outcomes in children. Patients with dengue‐related symptoms (aged 1–15 years) admitted at a public hospital in Northeast Brazil were invited to participate. The association between rs12979860 polymorphism and dengue classification and clinical signs and symptoms were analysed. A total of 206 DENV‐infected children were included: 53.4% of the infections were classified as severe dengue. The T allele carriers had higher risk of developing severe dengue when compared to CC genotype carriers (OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 0.98–3.32 p = .054). The T allele carriers also showed longer fever episodes when compared to patients with the CC genotype (OR: 1.90; 95%CI: 1.07–3.38; p = .027). On the other hand, the ones carrying the CT/TT genotype had 70% lower chance of developing thrombocytopenia when compared to those with the CC genotype (OR: 0.30; 95%CI: 0.08–0.88; p = .042). Our findings demonstrated that the T allele carriers of the IFNL3 gene had higher risk of developing severe dengue, suggesting a link between IFN‐λ expression and DENV immunopathogenesis.

AB  - > La dengue (DEN) est devenue la principale virose emergente a transmission vectorielle des regions tropicales et subtropicales en Asie du sud-est et en Amerique latine [1]. La maladie affecte annuellement plus de 100 millions d’individus sur les 2 milliards vivant dans les regions infestees par le moustique vecteur Aedes aegypti [2]. La dengue constitue un probleme croissant de sante publique, du fait de l’extension des zones infestees et de l’augmentation du nombre de cas graves dans les regions a forte endemicite, responsable d’une mortalite croissante, principalement chez les enfants. La grande majorite (environ 90 %) des infections par le virus de la dengue (VDEN) sont asymptomatiques et les formes symptomatiques peuvent aller d’une fievre benigne non differenciee jusqu’a une forme gravissime, la fievre hemorragique de dengue (FHD), caracterisee par une permeabilite vasculaire accrue et un dereglement de l’hemostase [2, 3]. Dans les formes extremes, un choc hypovolemique peut survenir (syndrome de choc de dengue, SCD) qui peut etre mortel. L’extreme variabilite des manifestations cliniques apres infection par le VDEN serait liee, d’une part, a des facteurs exterieurs, tels que la virulence des souches virales et les infections virales sequentielles et, d’autre part, a des facteurs individuels, comme l’âge, l’etat nutritionnel et le terrain genetique. L’observation d’un risque de DHF/SCD plus eleve chez les Caucasiens que chez les Noirs, lors d’epidemies de dengue en Amerique du Sud, suggere fortement la contribution de facteurs genetiques [4]. Les formes graves de dengue sont d’ailleurs peu documentees dans les regions d’Afrique ou la dengue est endemique. Les cellules dendritiques (DC) myeloides interstitielles sont les premieres cibles du VDEN inocule par le moustique a travers l’epiderme. La lectine de surface DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN ou CD209) est un recepteur d’attachement au VDEN via la reconnaissance de la glycoproteine E de l’enveloppe virale. Cette interaction est indispensable a l’infection productive des DC [5, 6]. Du fait de son role cle dans les premieres etapes de l’infection, nous avons donc considere le gene DC-SIGN comme un candidat pouvant intervenir dans la variabilite inter-individuelle du risque d’infection par le DVEN ou des manifestations cliniques [7]. En collaboration etroite avec des groupes de Mahidol University (Thailande), nous avons recrute une grande population cas/temoins provenant de trois hopitaux thailandais. Au total, plus de 600 patients hospitalises avec des formes graves de dengue ont ete inclus dans l’etude, ainsi que 700 temoins. Le diagnostic de dengue a ete confirme serologiquement chez tous les patients, et, afin de limiter le risque d’heterogeneite, nous avons exclu de l’etude tous les patients dont la seule manifestation clinique etait la fievre. Les patients atteints de formes graves de la maladie ont ete classes en deux sousgroupes : ceux qui ne presentaient pas de manifestations de fuite plasmatique (fievre de dengue « classique », FD) et ceux qui en presentaient (FDH). Dans un premier temps, nous avons crible par sequencage la totalite des exons et la region promotrice du gene DC-SIGN chez 80 individus thailandais, afin d’en identifier tous les variants genetiques. Parmi les 40 variants identifies, nous avons initialement selectionne huit variants critiques : trois variants codants mais rares (frequence de l’allele rare 0,02) permettant de couvrir la totalite de la variabilite genetique du gene. Sur la base de resultats interessants obtenus pour l’un de ces variants, nous avons ensuite examine tous les variants presentant un desequilibre de liaison avec celui-ci dans la totalite de la population. Par des analyses d’association, nous avons ainsi pu montrer qu’un variant localise dans la region promotrice de DC-SIGN, DCSIGN1-336, confere une protection contre l’une des formes cliniques de la maladie, la FD (fievre de dengue), alors qu’il n’affecte pas globalement le risque d’infection par le virus (Figure 1) : la frequence des individus porteurs de l’allele rare – 336G (genotypes GG et GA) est de 4,7 % dans le groupe des FD, alors qu’elle est de 22,4 % chez les FHD (rapport de risque de FHD versus FD de 5,84 ; test statistique : p = 1,4 x 107), et de 19,5 % chez

TI  - Association of ABO and RH Blood Group with Dengue Infection: A Cross-Sectional Study at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Rawalpindi
JF  - Life and Science
AB  - Objective: To determine an association of ABO and Rh blood group with dengue infectionsusceptibility.Study Design: Cross-sectional study.Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted at Department of Pathology, Army Medical College inalliance with Pak-Emirates Military Hospital (PEMH) Rawalpindi, Pakistan from November 2022 to December2022.Methods: The study was conducted on two groups, one group had 102 dengue positive patient and the othergroup had 928 normal sample population presenting to the hospital. We applied Fisher's Exact/Chi-square test.Samples were collected by convenience sampling technique. Patients with any other concomitant infectionsuch as malaria or typhoid the study were excluded from group 1. ABO and Rh blood grouping done by tubemethod and verified by forward tile method. Serological testing for dengue for presence of IgM and NS1 doneby Rapid chromatographic immunoassay test (ICT) method.Results: The distribution of ABO and Rh blood groups in both the normal population and dengue-positivepatient groups was similar. In the normal sample population, the prevalence of O+ blood type was 30.1%,closely aligning with the 38.2% observed in dengue-positive patients. While the 38.2% figure is higher than thatof the normal population, it reflects a notable increase. Similarly, other blood group distribution is matchedwith O- 3.3% in normal sample and 2.0% in dengue positive. Blood group B+ is 28.0% in normal sample and26.5% in dengue positive patient. Blood group A+ being 22.4% in normal sample population and 24.5% indengue positive patients.Conclusion: According to this study, blood group O has a slightly higher percentage of dengue patientscompared to its prevalence in the general population. The prevalence of other blood groups in dengue patientsclosely mirrors their prevalence in the general population. Further research is needed to assess if HLA and ABOare dependent or independent risk factors and if certain blood groups have a higher chance of DENV infection.

AB  - CONTEXT: Dengue fever (DF) has been steadily increasing in India with outbreaks in certain areas taking the proportion of epidemics. Along with secondary dengue, several risk factors predispose to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Very few studies associating the relationship between dengue and its severity with ABO blood group have been documented. AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the association between distribution of ABO Rh blood groups and DF and DF with thrombocytopenia. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective descriptive study conducted at the clinical laboratory of the department of microbiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dengue patients whose case record contained information on blood group were screened for details of blood group and confirmed dengue diagnosis. Randomly 384 case records were selected. These were divided into two groups; Group 1 included DF cases (platelet count >20,000) and Group 2 included DF cases with thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20,000). Control group consisted of patients other than dengue, whose blood grouping had been done; randomly 390 were selected and analyzed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: P value was calculated using the Chi-square test. Odds ratio were calculated using the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: DF was higher in 23% of individuals with AB blood group as compared to 8.5% of controls (P = 0.0004), whereas patients with blood group O were significantly less affected with DF (P = 0.0048). Disease severity was not associated with any of the blood groups. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with AB blood group are more prone to DF, whereas individuals with blood group O are less prone.

TI  - Association of Alix with late endosomal lysobisphosphatidic acid is important for dengue virus infection in human endothelial cells.
JF  - Journal of proteome research
VL  - 9 9
SP  - 4640
EP  - 8
AB  - The most severe form of dengue virus (DENV) infection is dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), which is accompanied by increased vascular permeability indicating that endothelial cells are the targets of DENV infection. However, molecular mechanisms underlying DENV replication in endothelial cells remained poorly understood. We therefore examined changes in subcellular proteomes of different cellular compartments (including cytosolic, membrane/organelle, nucleus, and cytoskeleton) of human endothelial (EA.hy926) cells upon DENV2 infection using a 2-DE-based proteomics approach followed by Q-TOF MS and MS/MS. A total of 35 altered proteins were identified in these subcellular locales, including an increase in the level of Alix (apoptosis-linked gene-2-interacting protein X) in the cytosolic fraction of DENV2-infected cells compared to mock control cells. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed colocalization of Alix with late endosomal lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA). This complex has been proposed to be involved in the export of DENV proteins from late endosomes to the cytoplasm. Subsequent functional study revealed that pretreatment with an anti-LBPA antibody prior to DENV challenge significantly reduced the level of viral envelope protein synthesis and DENV replication. Our data indicate that Alix plays a pivotal role in the early phase of DENV replication, particularly when it arrives at the late endosome stage. Blocking this step may lead to a novel therapeutic approach to reducing the level of DENV replication in vivo.

TI  - Association of BAK1 single nucleotide polymorphism with a risk for dengue hemorrhagic fever
JF  - BMC Medical Genetics
VL  - 17
AB  - BackgroundDengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a severe life-threatening form of dengue infection. Low platelet count is one of the characteristic clinical manifestations in patients with severe dengue. However, little is known about genetic factors in the host that cause low platelet count in patients with dengue.MethodsA previous genome-wide association study of hematological and biochemical traits identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with low platelet count in healthy subjects. To examine the possible association of these SNPs with DHF, 918 Thai patients with dengue [509 patients with DHF and 409 with dengue fever (DF)] were genotyped for five SNPs: rs5745568 in BAK1, rs6141 in THPO, rs6065 in GP1BA, rs739496 in SH2B3, and rs385893 in RCL1. In addition, rs4804803 in CD209, that has been reported to be associated with dengue infection, was also genotyped to examine if rs4804803 affects the association detected in this study.ResultsThe allele frequencies of each SNP were compared between the DHF and DF groups. Among the five SNPs, the G allele of rs5745568 in BAK1 was significantly associated with a risk for DHF [P = 0.006 and crude odd ratio (95 % confidence interval) = 1.32 (1.09–1.60)]. The association of this allele with DHF was also significant in a logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, hospital (i.e., geographic region), immune status (i.e., primary or secondary infection), and virus serotype [P = 0.016 and adjusted odd ratio (95 % confidence interval) = 1.29 (1.05–1.58)]. The result was not influenced by rs4804803 [P = 0.0167 and adjusted OR (95 % CI) = 1.29 (1.05–1.58)]. No other SNPs including rs4804803 showed significant association.ConclusionsThe low-level constitutive production of platelets caused by the G allele of rs5745568 seems to increase the risk of bleeding in dengue infection. Our results suggest that BCL-2 homologous antagonist/killer (BAK) protein, encoded by BAK1, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of DHF.

TI  - Association of Dengue Virus Serotypes 1&2 with Severe Dengue Having Deletions in Their 3′Untranslated Regions (3′UTRs)
JF  - Microorganisms
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue virus infections are recorded as hyper-endemic in many countries, including India. Research pertaining to the reasons for frequent outbreaks and severe dengue is ongoing. Hyderabad city, India, has been recorded as a ‘hotspot’ for dengue virus infections. Dengue virus strains circulating over the past few years in Hyderabad city have been characterized at the molecular level to analyze the serotype/genotypes; 3′UTRs were further amplified and sequenced. The disease severity in patients infected with dengue virus strains with complete and 3′UTR deletion mutants was analyzed. Genotype I of the serotype 1 replaced genotype III, which has been circulating over the past few years in this region. Coincidentally, the number of dengue virus infections significantly increased in this region during the study period. Nucleotide sequence analysis suggested twenty-two and eight nucleotide deletions in the 3′UTR of DENV-1. The eight nucleotide deletions observed in the case of DENV-1 3′UTR were the first reported in this instance. A 50 nucleotide deletion was identified in the case of the serotype DENV-2. Importantly, these deletion mutants were found to cause severe dengue, even though they were found to be replication incompetent. This study emphasized the role of dengue virus 3′UTRs on severe dengue and emerging outbreaks.

TI  - Association of Endothelial Glycocalyx and Tight and Adherens Junctions With Severity of Plasma Leakage in Dengue Infection
JF  - The Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 215
SP  - 992
EP  - 999
AB  - Abstract Background. The role of vascular endothelial (VE) components in dengue infection with plasma leakage is unknown. Therefore, we conducted a study to determine the adjusted association of the endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) and tight and adherens junction markers with plasma leakage. 
Methods. A prospective observational study was conducted at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital and Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Adult dengue patients admitted to the hospital on the third day of fever from November 2013 through August 2015 were included in the study. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the adjusted association of the VE biomarkers with the severity of the plasma leakage. 
Results. A total of 103 dengue-infected patients participated in the study. In the critical phase, levels of syndecan-1 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.004; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.001–1.007) and chondroitin sulfate (OR = 1.157; 95% CI = 1.025–1.307) had an adjusted association with plasma leakage, whereas levels of syndecan-1 (OR = 1.004; 95% CI = 1.000–1.008) and claudin-5 (OR = 1.038; 95% CI = 1.004–1.074) had an adjusted association with severe plasma leakage. Conclusions. In dengue-infected patients, elevated levels of syndecan-1 and chondroitin sulfate are strongly associated with plasma leakage, and elevated levels of syndecan-1 and claudin-5 are strongly associated with severe plasma leakage.

TI  - Association of Genetic Polymorphisms in TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR8 with the Clinical Forms of Dengue in Patients from Veracruz, Mexico
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue manifestations range from a mild form, dengue fever (DF), to more severe forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The ability of the host to present one of these clinical forms could be related to polymorphisms located in genes of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which activate the pro-inflammatory response. Therefore, the genotyping of single nucleotide genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR3 (rs3775291 and rs6552950), TLR4 (rs2737190, rs10759932, rs4986790, rs4986791, rs11536865, and rs10983755), TLR7 (rs179008 and rs3853839), and TLR8 (rs3764880, rs5741883, rs4830805, and rs1548731) was carried out in non-genetically related DHF patients, DF patients, and general population (GP) subjects. The SNPs were analyzed by real-time PCR by genotyping assays from Applied Biosystems®. The codominance model showed that dengue patients had a lower probability of presenting the TLR4-rs2737190-G/G genotype (odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) = 0.34 (0.14–0.8), p = 0.038). Dengue patients showed a lower probability of presenting TLR4-rs11536865-G/C genotype (OR (95% CI) = 0.19 (0.05–0.73), p = 0.0092) and had a high probability of presenting the TACG haplotype, but lower probability of presenting the TGCG haplotype in the TLR4 compared to GP individuals (OR (95% CI) = 0.55 (0.35–0.86), p = 0.0084). In conclusion, the TLR4-rs2737190-G/G and TLR4-rs11536865-G/C genotypes and TGCG haplotype were associated with protection from dengue.

TI  - Association of HLA Class-I and Inhibitory KIR Genotypes in Gabonese Patients Infected by Chikungunya or Dengue Type-2 Viruses
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - Background Natural killer (NK) cells provide defense in the early stages of the immune response against viral infections. Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) expressed on the surface of NK cells play an important role in regulating NK cell response through recognition of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules on target cells. Previous studies have shown that specific KIR/ligand combinations are associated with the outcome of several viral infectious diseases. Methods We investigated the impact of inhibitory and activating KIR and their HLA-class I ligand genotype on the susceptibility to Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV2) infections. From April to July 2010 in Gabon, a large outbreak of CHIKV and DENV2 concomitantly occurred in two provinces of Gabon (Ogooué-Lolo and Haut-Ogooué). We performed the genotypic analysis of KIR in the combination with their cognate HLA-class I ligands in 73 CHIKV and 55 DENV2 adult cases, compared with 54 healthy individuals. Results We found in CHIV-infected patients that KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS5 are significantly increased and decreased respectively, as compared to DENV2+ patients and healthy donors. The combination of KIR2DL1 and its cognate HLA-C2 ligand was significantly associated with the susceptibility to CHIKV infection. In contrast, no other inhibitory KIR-HLA pairs showed an association with the two mosquito-borne arboviruses. Conclusion These observations are strongly suggestive that the NK cell repertoire shaped by the KIR2DL1:HLA-C2 interaction facilitate specific infection by CHIKV.

TI  - Association of IL1B -31C/T and IL1RA variable number of an 86-bp tandem repeat with dengue shock syndrome in Thailand.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 210 1
SP  - 138
EP  - 45
AB  - BACKGROUND
Dengue patients present a range of symptoms: dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). It is not clear whether this variability is due to their genetic background. Here we tested polymorphisms of interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA) genes for association with DSS in the Thai population.


METHODS
Polymorphisms of IL1B -31C/T (rs1143627) and IL1RA 86-base-pair tandem repeat were analyzed in 871 patients (DF = 384, DHF = 413, and DSS = 74).


RESULTS
IL1B -31C and IL1RA 2/4 genotype were associated with DSS (IL1B -31C: DSS vs DHF: P = .0061, odds ratio [OR, 95% confidence interval {CI}], 3.49 [1.36-8.95]; DSS vs DF: P = .027, OR [95% CI], 2.81 [1.12-7.06]; IL1RA 2/4: DSS vs DHF: P = .017, OR [95% CI], 1.94 [1.12-3.40]; DSS vs DF: P = .024, OR [95% CI], 1.90 [1.07-3.4]). No difference was found between DF and DHF. Logistic regression analysis revealed that IL1B -31C and IL1RA 2/4 genotypes were each independently associated with DSS.


CONCLUSIONS
Patients with IL1B -31C carrier, or IL1RA 2/4 genotype carry a risk for DSS, implying that IL1B may play a role in pathogenesis of DSS.

AB  - Dengue is an important infectious disease that has high morbidity and mortality rates in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world. The diversity of the clinical manifestations involved in the outcome of dengue virus infection is affected by the relationship between serotype/genotype of the virus, host immune status, host genetic background, and environmental factors. Polymorphisms in interleukin (IL) genes have been associated with risk of developing symptomatic dengue. This study aimed to determine the association of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms of IL1β -511C>T, IL1RN 86 bp VNTR, and IL6 -174G>C genes with the clinical features of 198 individuals admitted to the São José Infectious Diseases Hospital with suspected dengue infection. Dengue was confirmed in 118 of the patients. The control group consisted of 80 other individuals who had symptoms similar to dengue, but negative for that. A higher frequency of increased hematocrit (p = 0.009), leukopenia (p = 0.000007), neutropenia (p = 0.0004), lymphocytosis (p = 0.00001), monocytosis (p = 0.004), atypical lymphocytes (p = 0.03), and thrombocytopenia (p = 0.0000009) was observed in the dengue patients. Among the polymorphisms studied, only IL1β (-511C>T) was associated with dizziness, (p = 0.01), suggesting that IL1β may be related to hypotensive episodes and increased vascular permeability. These results pointed out the importance of the IL1β (-511C>T) polymorphism in the development of clinical symptoms of dengue symptomology.

AB  - Abstract Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring in immune-related genes have been associated with risk or protection for development of dengue, depending on ethnicity. Here, we genotyped seven SNPs located in immune response-related genes to identify their association with severe forms of dengue in patients from an endemic region in Mexico. One hundred and thirty-eight patients with dengue fever (DF), thirty-one dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) patients, as well as 304 healthy donors were genotyped by using a TaqMan-based approach. SNP analysis, including rs1800629 (TNF), rs4804803 (CD209), rs2780831 (JAK1), rs1801274 (FCGR2A), rs231775 (CTLA4), rs12979860, and rs8099917 (IFNL3), was performed. The rs1800629 A-allele in the TNF gene was associated with an increased risk of DHF (OR = 3.4, CI = 1.235–9.284 p = 0.0212) whereas SNPs rs4804803, rs2780831, rs1801274, rs231775, rs12979860, and rs8099917 showed no association in this cohort. These results show that allelic variations in TNF can play an im...

AB  - The dengue virus is an arbovirus belonging to the family, Flaviviridae. DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 are the 4 serotypes. It is categorized according to WHO 2009 as non-severe Dengue (with or without warning signs) and Severe Dengue. Dengue fever is endemic in around 100 countries with higher densities in the American, Southeast Asian, and Western Pacific regions. Most states in India show high prevalence of Dengue, resulting in hospitalisation. It has been estimated that 390 million people are annually infected and around 96 million present with the disease. India recorded 188,401 dengue cases and 325 deaths, in 2017. Around the world, 50-100 million people get infected by dengue and around 2-5 lakhs of them present with severe forms.

TI  - Association of dengue disease severity and blood group: A systematic review and meta‐analysis
JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology
VL  - 31
AB  - Dengue disease encompasses various clinical manifestations including dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). In this article, we aimed to systematically review and analyze the association between different blood groups and severity of dengue. We searched nine databases for eligible papers reporting prevalence, distribution, and frequency of blood group type among dengue patients. Network meta‐analysis using R software was used to analyze the data. Of a total of 63 reports screened, we included 10 studies with total sample size 1977 patients (1382 DF and 595 DHF). Blood group O was found to have the worst outcome with the highest risk of developing DF (P‐score = 0.01) followed by group B (P‐score = 0.34), group A (P‐score = 0.64), and group AB (P‐score = 1), respectively. Blood group O also had the worst outcome with highest risk of developing DHF (P‐score = 0.1) followed by group B (P‐score = 0.29), group A (P‐score = 0.61), and group AB (P‐score = 1), respectively. There was a significant increase (P‐value <.001) in the overall odds risk of dengue infection among patients with Rhesus‐positive blood groups [OR = 540.03; (95% CI = 151.48‐1925.18)]. However, there was no significant difference in the odds risk of DF when compared to DHF according to Rhesus status (P‐value = .954). This study identified the O blood group as a potential risk factor in predicting clinical severity in dengue patients which may be helpful in evaluating patients for their likely need for critical care.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 89 Pt 10
SP  - 2492
EP  - 500
AB  - During the replication of dengue virus, a viral non-structural glycoprotein, NS1, associates with the membrane on the cell surface and in the RNA replication complex. NS1 lacks a transmembrane domain, and the mechanism by which it associates with the membrane remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether membrane-bound NS1 is present in lipid rafts in dengue virus-infected cells. Double immunofluorescence staining of infected HEK-293T cells revealed that NS1 localized with raft-associated molecules, ganglioside GM1 and CD55, on the cell surface. In a flotation gradient centrifugation assay, a small proportion of NS1 in Triton X-100 cell lysate consistently co-fractionated with raft markers. Association of NS1 with lipid rafts was detected for all four dengue serotypes, as well as for Japanese encephalitis virus. Analysis of recombinant NS1 forms showed that glycosylated NS1 dimers stably expressed in HEK-293T cells without an additional C-terminal sequence, or with a heterologous transmembrane domain, failed to associate with lipid rafts. In contrast, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked recombinant NS1 exhibited a predilection for lipid rafts. These results indicate an association of a minor subpopulation of NS1 with lipid rafts during dengue virus infection and suggest that modification of NS1, possibly lipidation, is required for raft association.

AB  - Objective: To determine the association of different blood groups in patients with Dengue fever and their relationship with the severity of the illness. Methods: A hospital-based descriptive study was conducted in the Dengue Isolation Ward of Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar from March 2020 to September 2020. Patients with Dengue fever were included in the study. The severity of the illness was categorized as “Dengue fever (DF)”, “Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)”, and “Dengue shock syndrome (DSS)”. The patients’ blood groups were determined as A, B, AB, and O groups. All the data were recorded and analyzed using SPSS® version 23. Chi-square (χ2) and student t-test were applied, and a p-value of ≤0.05 was considered significant. Results: Out of 160 patients, 119(74.4%) were males; the patient’s mean age was 38.09±15.68 SD, IQR=25 years. Greater proportion (28%) of the young men (up to 40 years) was affected compared to 9% young women. Fever (99%) and body aches (96%) were the most common presentation of DF, complicated by bleeding in 30.6% and shock in 9.4% of the patients. The majority (63.1%) of the patients had DF; 27.5% had DHF, and 9.4% had DSS. Sixty three (39.4%) patients had blood Group-B and 5.6% had Group-AB (p=0.97). The proportion of patients with different blood groups and the type/severity of the DF were almost identical except the fact that none of the patient with group AB had DSS. There was significant gender difference of hemoglobin (p=0.008, 95%CI=0.439, 2.844), hematocrit (p=0.012, 95%CI=0.00974, 0.07946); and Alanine Aminotransferase levels (p=0.002, 95%CI=-332.032, -72.233). Conclusion: Patients with blood Group-B were more frequent and AB was least commonly affected by the Dengue-virus infections. However, no association was found between a particular blood group and disease severity. Greater proportions of the younger men had Dengue infections.

TI  - Association of exosomal miR‐96‐5p and miR‐146a‐5p with the disease severity in dengue virus infection
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles secreted by cells and have a major role in cell‐to‐cell signaling. As dengue infection progresses from a mild to a severe form of infection, the exosome's microRNA (miRNA) composition might change, which may contribute to pathogenesis. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of serum exosomal miRNAs was performed and their involvement in dengue virus‐induced disease progression in an Indian cohort was assessed. Small RNA‐seq showed 50 differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs that were significantly dysregulated during dengue infection. After extensive validation, miR‐96‐5p was found to be significantly upregulated, whereas miR‐146a‐5p was significantly downregulated with the progression of disease to severe form. Interestingly, a strong positive correlation was found between the expression levels of miR‐96‐5p and miR‐146a‐5p and the platelet levels of the patients. Further, study of miR‐146a‐5p showed that it regulates the expression of the proteins which are involved in the immune responses. These results suggest that miR‐96‐5p and miR‐146a‐5p could be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers for dengue disease progression, in addition to the already available biochemical and pathological parameters.

TI  - Association of human immune response to Aedes aegypti salivary proteins with dengue disease severity
JF  - Parasite Immunology
VL  - 34
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV; family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) are transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and can cause dengue fever (DF), a relatively benign disease, or more severe dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Arthropod saliva contains proteins delivered into the bite wound that can modulate the host haemostatic and immune responses to facilitate the intake of a blood meal. The potential effects on DENV infection of previous exposure to Ae. aegypti salivary proteins have not been investigated. We collected Ae. aegypti saliva, concentrated the proteins and fractionated them by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). By the use of immunoblots, we analysed reactivity with the mosquito salivary proteins (MSP) of sera from 96 Thai children diagnosed with secondary DENV infections leading either to DF or DHF, or with no DENV infection, and found that different proportions of each patient group had serum antibodies reactive to specific Ae. aegypti salivary proteins. Our results suggest that prior exposure to MSP might play a role in the outcome of DENV infection in humans.

AB  - Dengue is an infectious disease of viral etiology transmitted by the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti, A. albopictus, and A. scutellaris. It can develop either as a benign form or as a severe hemorrhagic form. Previous work showed an association of the hemorrhagic form with human leukocyte antigens (HLA), suggesting a role of genetic factors in disease susceptibility. Nevertheless, data on HLA association with the classical form of the disease is scarce in literature. Sixty-four patients and 667 normal individuals, living in the state of Parana, Southern Brazil, were used as test and control group, respectively. The patients developed the disease during a virus 1 dengue outbreak either in Maringa city in 1995 (47) or in Paranavai city in 1999 (17). The diagnostic was confirmed through serology and/or viral culture. HLA class I and II typing was performed by the classical microlynfocitotoxicity test using monoclonal antisera and fluorobeads. Qui-square statistical analysis confirmed a positive association with HLA-DQ1 (76.6% vs 57.7%; p = 0.005243; pc = 0.026215). HLA-DR1 also presented an increased frequency in the test group, not statistically significant after p correction though (32.8% vs 15.9%; p = 0.005729; pc = 0.080206). In conclusion, genetic factors may play a role on the susceptibility to the classical dengue, virus 1, in the Brazilian population. Further independent studies should be performed in the Brazilian population to confirm these preliminary data.

AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus assembles into an inert particle that requires proteolytic activation by furin to enable transmission to other hosts. We previously showed that immature virus undergoes a conformational change at low pH that renders it accessible to furin (I. M. Yu, W. Zhang, H. A. Holdaway, L. Li, V. A. Kostyuchenko, P. R. Chipman, R. J. Kuhn, M. G. Rossmann, and J. Chen, Science 319:1834-1837, 2008). Here we show, using cryoelectron microscopy, that the structure of immature dengue virus at pH 6.0 is essentially the same before and after the cleavage of prM. The structure shows that after cleavage, the proteolytic product pr remains associated with the virion at acidic pH, and that furin cleavage by itself does not induce any major conformational changes. We also show by liposome cofloatation experiments that pr retention prevents membrane insertion, suggesting that pr is present on the virion in the trans-Golgi network to protect the progeny virus from fusion within the host cell.

AB  - Individual studies have assessed the association between TNF-α-308G>A and TNF-α-238 G>A polymorphisms and severity of dengue infection. However, the results are inconclusive and most studies had small sample sizes. The objective of this study was to summarize the evidence of association between TNF-α-308 G>A and TNF-α-238 G>A and severity of dengue infection. This study follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta- analyses of genetic association studies, recommended by PLOS One. We calculated pooled odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate the association between TNF-α-308 G>A or TNF-α-238 G>A and the risk of severe dengue infections. To determine the information size required for this meta-analysis study, a trial sequential analysis (TSA) was done. Eight studies (640 cases and 1275 controls), which assessed the association of TNF-α-308 G>A or TNF-α-238 G>A and the risk of DHF were included. Overall, we found no significant association between TNF-α-308 G>A and the DHF risk in the allelic model (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.51–1.63), the recessive model (OR,1.32;95%CI,0.73–2.37), the dominant model (OR,0.93;95%CI:0.59–1.47) or the additive model (OR,1.43,95;95%CI:0.79–2.59). There was also no significant association between TNF-α-238 G>A and DHF risk under the allele contrast model (OR:1.51;95%CI:0.88–2.58), the recessive model (OR,1.48,95% CI:0.33–6.58), the dominant model (OR,1.48;95%CI:0.56–3.92), or the additive model (OR:1.5;95%CI:0.34–6.69). On subgroup analysis, neither the Asian population nor the non-Asian population showed significant association between TNF-α-308 G>A/TNF-α-238 G>A and the DHF risk under any genetic models. Leave-one-out meta-analysis showed stability of the results. TSA plots suggested that the sample size in this meta-analysis study was below the required information size. The findings suggest an inclusive evidence of the association between TNF-α-308/ TNF-α-238 G>A and the risk of developing severe dengue infection. Large studies with evidence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, assessing gene-gene interactions are recommended.

AB  - The role of human Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaR) has been recognized considerably over the last years. These receptors vary in their affinity for IgG subclasses and the intracellular signals elicited by them. Allelic variants of FcgammaR genes may influence the biological phagocyte activity, accounting for an inherited pre-disposition to disease. The specific FcgammaRIIa (CD32) contains a polymorphic variant (H/R131) that has been associated to a reduced risk for developing dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Here, we investigated the role of this polymorphism in a very well-characterized group of Cuban individuals with antecedents of DHF, dengue fever (DF), or subclinical dengue infection. The HH131 genotype was significantly associated with dengue disease, either DF (*P = 0.016; odds ratio = 4.425; 95% confidence interval = 1.10-20.52) or DHF (P = 0.00018; odds ratio = 10.56; 95% confidence interval = 2.33-54.64) with respect to the subclinical infection.

VL  - 110

EP  - 18667
AB  - Significance Dengue virus (DENV) infects nearly 400 million people annually, and approximately 40% of the world’s population lives at risk for infection. Without a therapeutic or vaccine available, DENV remains a major public health burden. Our studies provide a comprehensive structure–function analysis of the DENV Envelope protein, integrating information from numerous Envelope structures with our functional data into a cohesive mechanistic model. This model describes the dynamic processes by which specific residue interactions within Envelope mediate infectivity—from fusion-loop triggering to hinge movement to membrane fusion—and may also apply to related class II viral fusion proteins. Because of the importance of the specific amino acids identified, our results also identify new functional residue targets for DENV vaccines and therapeutics. A number of structures have been solved for the Envelope (E) protein from dengue virus and closely related flaviviruses, providing detailed pictures of the conformational states of the protein at different stages of infectivity. However, the key functional residues responsible for mediating the dynamic changes between these structures remain largely unknown. Using a comprehensive library of functional point mutations covering all 390 residues of the dengue virus E protein ectodomain, we identified residues that are critical for virus infectivity, but that do not affect E protein expression, folding, virion assembly, or budding. The locations and atomic interactions of these critical residues within different structures representing distinct fusogenic conformations help to explain how E protein (i) regulates fusion-loop exposure by shielding, tethering, and triggering its release; (ii) enables hinge movements between E domain interfaces during triggered structural transformations; and (iii) drives membrane fusion through late-stage zipper contacts with stem. These results provide structural targets for drug and vaccine development and integrate the findings from structural studies and isolated mutagenesis efforts into a cohesive model that explains how specific residues in this class II viral fusion protein enable virus infectivity.

TI  - Augmentation of 5-lipoxygenase activity and expression during dengue serotype-2 infection
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 10
AB  - Leukotriene B4, a 5-lipoxygenase product of arachidonic acid with potent chemotactic effects on neutrophils, has not been assessed in dengue patients. In this study, plasma leukotriene B4 and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were determined in adult patients during the febrile, convalescent and defervescent stages of dengue serotype-2 (DENV-2) infection, and compared with those of age--matched healthy and non-dengue febrile subjects. In vitro studies were performed to examine the effects of live and heat-inactivated DENV-2 on the activities and expression of 5-lipoxygenase in human neutrophils. Plasma leukotriene B4 was elevated during the febrile stages of dengue infection compared to levels during convalescence and in study controls. Plasma leukotriene B4 also correlated with serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in dengue patients (febrile, r = 0.91, p < 0.001; defervescence, r = 0.87, p < 0.001; convalescence, r = 0.87, p < 0.001). Exposure of human neutrophils to DENV-2 resulted in a significant rise in leukotriene B4; the extent of increase, however, did not differ between exposure to live and heat-inactivated DENV-2. Pre-incubation of either live or heat-inactivated DENV-2 resulted in reduced leukotriene B4 release by neutrophils, indicating that contact with dengue antigens (and not replication) triggers the neutrophil response. Production of leukotriene B4 was associated with an increase in 5-lipoxygenase expression in human neutrophils; addition of MK886 (a 5-lipoxygenase activating protein inhibitor) attenuated further increase in leukotriene B4 production. These findings provide important clinical and mechanistic data on the involvement of 5-lipoxygenase and its metabolites in dengue infection. Further studies are needed to elucidate the therapeutic implications of these findings.

TI  - Autoantibody Profiling in Plasma of Dengue Virus–Infected Individuals
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 9
AB  - Dengue is an arboviral disease caused by dengue virus (DENV) with high prevalence in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Autoimmune syndromes following dengue can be observed in long term follow up. Anti-DENV antibodies are cross-reactive with surface antigens on endothelial cells or platelets and could be involved in the pathogenesis of dengue. However, no studies have analyzed the autoantibody repertoire and its roles in dengue pathogenesis. Hence, we aimed to describe the autoantibody profile in dengue patients with different disease severities. We utilized a protein array with 128 putative autoantigens to screen for IgM and IgG reactivity in plasma obtained from healthy donors (n = 8), asymptomatic individuals infected with DENV (n = 11) and hospitalized dengue patients (n = 21). Even though the patient cohort is small, we show that 80 IgM and 6 IgG autoantibodies were elevated in DENV infected patients compared to age-matched healthy donors. Individuals undergoing a primary DENV infection showed higher amounts of IgG autoantibodies, not IgM autoantibodies, compared to individuals undergoing secondary infection. No differences were observed between asymptomatic and hospitalized dengue patients. Nineteen autoantibodies, which react against several coagulation and complement components, correlated with platelet counts in severe dengue patients. This current study provides a framework to explore a possible role of candidate autoantibodies in dengue immunopathogenesis.

AB  - The pathogenic mechanisms of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) caused by dengue virus (DV) infection remain unresolved. Patients with DHF/DSS are characterized by several manifestations, including severe thrombocytopenia, vascular leakage, and hepatomegaly. In addition to the effect of virus load and virus variation, abnormal immune responses of the host after DV infection may also account for the progression of DHF/DSS. Actually, viral autoimmunity is involved in the pathogenesis of numerous viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus, human hepatitis C virus, human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein- Barr virus, and DV. In this review, we discuss the implications of autoimmunity in dengue pathogenesis. Antibodies directed against DV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) showed cross-reactivity with human platelets and endothelial cells, which lead to platelet and endothelial cell damage and inflammatory activation. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that anti-DV NS1 is involved in the pathogenesis of DF and DHF/DSS, and this may provide important information in dengue vaccine development.

TI  - Autophagy Activation Induces p62-Dependent Autophagic Degradation of Dengue Virus Capsid Protein During Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - In the past decade, dengue virus infection is one of the most prevalent and rapidly spreading arthropod-borne diseases worldwide with about 400 million infections every year. Although it has been reported that the dengue virus could take advantage of autophagy to promote its propagation, the association between selective autophagy and the dengue virus remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrated that dengue virus capsid protein, the key viral protein for virus assembly, maturation, and replication, underwent autophagic degradation after autophagy activation. Autophagy cargo receptor p62 delivered ubiquitinated capsid protein to autophagosomes for degradation, which could be enhanced by Torin 1 treatments. Further study revealed that the association between p62 and viral capsid protein was dependent on the ubiquitin-binding domain of p62, and the poly-ubiquitin conjugated at lysine 76 of capsid protein served as a recognition signal for autophagy. Consistently, p62 deficiency in Huh7 cells led to the enhancement of dengue virus replication. Our study revealed that p62 targeted dengue virus capsid protein for autophagic degradation in a ubiquitin-dependent manner, which might uncover the potential roles of p62 in restricting dengue virus replication.

JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most prevalent human pathogens worldwide. It caus‐ es a huge socioeconomic burden with approximately 400 million infections per year, but yet there is no vaccine or antiviral that is currently effective against the disease. DENV is spread by the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, and viral replication within the mosquito vector is required for transmission to human host. During its replication cy‐ cle, the virus cause significant changes to the host transcriptome profile, especially in the metabolic and trafficking pathways. Recent studies have shown a strong association be‐ tween autophagy and lipid metabolism modulation. For many years, biochemistry studies have been forgotten and replaced by the most ad‐ vanced techniques and theories in molecular biology and their promises for solving the "life code"; however, after many years of strong molecular biology research, it had not found the key of many problems with which we have the elemental biosystems like vi‐ ruses. Decades of molecular virology investigations did not give more light about several cellular processes that occurred into the host cells when the infections happen. The mo‐ lecular virologists have cloned many viral genes, manipulating full viral genomes, and engineering chimeric constructs to study many details at the molecular level, but the host cell and the encrypted viruses do not want to reveal their secrets. Only with the new perspective of complex diseases, a new approach has emerged: An in‐ tegrative methodology wherein molecular cell biology is converging with the most pure and elegant biochemistry. In this way, more extensive research is necessary for future comparative analyses of the host and vector metabolic/signaling environments required for viral replication.

TI  - Autophagy, EVs, and Infections: A Perfect Question for a Perfect Time
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - Autophagy, a highly conserved process, serves to maintain cellular homeostasis in response to an extensive variety of internal and external stimuli. The classic, or canonical, pathway of autophagy involves the coordinated degradation and recycling of intracellular components and pathogenic material. Proper regulation of autophagy is critical to maintain cellular health, as alterations in the autophagy pathway have been linked to the progression of a variety of physiological and pathological conditions in humans, namely in aging and in viral infection. In addition to its canonical role as a degradative pathway, a more unconventional and non-degradative role for autophagy has emerged as an area of increasing interest. This process, known as secretory autophagy, is gaining widespread attention as many viruses are believed to use this pathway as a means to release and spread viral particles. Moreover, secretory autophagy has been found to intersect with other intracellular pathways, such as the biogenesis and secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Here, we provide a review of the current landscape surrounding both degradative autophagy and secretory autophagy in relation to both aging and viral infection. We discuss their key features, while describing their interplay with numerous different viruses (i.e. hepatitis B and C viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, SV40, herpesviruses, HIV, chikungunya virus, dengue virus, Zika virus, Ebola virus, HTLV, Rift Valley fever virus, poliovirus, and influenza A virus), and compare secretory autophagy to other pathways of extracellular vesicle release. Lastly, we highlight the need for, and emphasize the importance of, more thorough methods to study the underlying mechanisms of these pathways to better advance our understanding of disease progression.

TI  - B Cell Responses during Secondary Dengue Virus Infection Are Dominated by Highly Cross-Reactive, Memory-Derived Plasmablasts
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90

EP  - 5585
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infection results in the production of both type-specific and cross-neutralizing antibodies. While immunity to the infecting serotype is long-lived, heterotypic immunity wanes a few months after infection. Epidemiological studies link secondary heterotypic infections with more severe symptoms, and cross-reactive, poorly neutralizing antibodies have been implicated in this increased disease severity. To understand the cellular and functional properties of the acute dengue virus B cell response and its role in protection and immunopathology, we characterized the plasmablast response in four secondary DENV type 2 (DENV2) patients. Dengue plasmablasts had high degrees of somatic hypermutation, with a clear preference for replacement mutations. Clonal expansions were also present in each donor, strongly supporting a memory origin for these acutely induced cells. We generated 53 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from sorted patient plasmablasts and found that DENV-reactive MAbs were largely envelope specific and cross neutralizing. Many more MAbs neutralized DENV than reacted to envelope protein, emphasizing the significance of virion-dependent B cell epitopes and the limitations of envelope protein-based antibody screening. A majority of DENV-reactive MAbs, irrespective of neutralization potency, enhanced infection by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Interestingly, even though DENV2 was the infecting serotype in all four patients, several MAbs from two patients neutralized DENV1 more potently than DENV2. Further, half of all type-specific neutralizing MAbs were also DENV1 biased in binding. Taken together, these findings are reminiscent of original antigenic sin (OAS), given that the patients had prior dengue virus exposures. These data describe the ongoing B cell response in secondary patients and may further our understanding of the impact of antibodies in dengue virus pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE In addition to their role in protection, antibody responses have been hypothesized to contribute to the pathology of dengue. Recent studies characterizing memory B cell (MBC)-derived MAbs have provided valuable insight into the targets and functions of B cell responses generated after DENV exposure. However, in the case of secondary infections, such MBC-based approaches fail to distinguish acutely induced cells from the preexisting MBC pool. Our characterization of plasmablasts and plasmablast-derived MAbs provides a focused analysis of B cell responses activated during ongoing infection. Additionally, our studies provide evidence of OAS in the acute-phase dengue virus immune response, providing a basis for future work examining the impact of OAS phenotype antibodies on protective immunity and disease severity in secondary infections.

TI  - B cell receptor dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 20
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue, a mosquito-borne disease that represents a significant and growing public health burden around the world. A unique pathophysiological feature of dengue is immune-mediated enhancement, wherein preexisting immunity elicited by a primary infection can enhance the severity of a subsequent infection by a heterologous DENV serotype. A leading mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), where sub-neutralizing concentrations of DENV-specific IgG antibodies facilitate entry of DENV into FcγR expressing cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Accordingly, this model posits that phagocytic mononuclear cells are the primary reservoir of DENV. However, analysis of samples from individuals experiencing acute DENV infection reveals that B cells are the largest reservoir of infected circulating cells, representing a disconnect in our understanding of immune-mediated DENV tropism. In this study, we demonstrate that the expression of a DENV-specific B cell receptor (BCR) renders cells highly susceptible to DENV infection, with the infection-enhancing activity of the membrane-restricted BCR correlating with the ADE potential of the IgG version of the antibody. In addition, we observed that the frequency of DENV-infectable B cells increases in previously flavivirus-naïve volunteers after a primary DENV infection. These findings suggest that BCR-dependent infection of B cells is a novel mechanism immune-mediated enhancement of DENV-infection.

TI  - B cell subset alteration and the expression of tissue homing molecules in dengue infected patients
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 25
AB  - B cells play an essential role during dengue viral infection. While a major expansion of antibody secreting cells (ASCs) was observed, the importance of these increased frequencies of ASCs remains unclear. The alteration of B cell subsets may result from the expression of tissue specific homing molecules leading to their mobilization and distribution to different target organs during acute dengue viral infection. In this study, whole blood samples were obtained from thirty pediatric dengue-infected patients and ten healthy children and then stained with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD27, CD38, CD45, CD138 and homing molecules of interest before analyzed by polychromatic flow cytometry. B cell subsets were characterized throughout acute infection period. Data shows that there were no detectable differences in frequencies of resting, activated and tissue memory cells, whereas the frequency of ASCs was significantly increased and associated with the lower frequency of naïve cells. These results were found from patients with both dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever, suggesting that such change or alteration of B cells was not associated with disease severity. Moreover, several homing molecules (e.g., CXCR3 and CCR2) were found in ASCs, indicating that ASCs may distribute to inflamed tissues and various organs. Findings from this study provide insight into B cell subset distribution. Furthermore, organ mobilization according to homing molecule expression on different B cell subsets during the course of dengue viral infection also suggests they are distributed to inflamed tissues and various organs.

AB  - Low-avidity serotype-cross-reactive antibodies are hypothesized to play a key role in triggering severe disease in patients with secondary dengue virus (DENV) infection. However, there is little systematic information about the frequency, avidity, and cross-reactivity of DENV-specific B cells in individuals experiencing primary instead of secondary infection. We compared DENV-specific B-cell responses in a cohort of Thai children with primary or secondary DENV infection. B cells specific for DENV precursor membrane protein, envelope (E) protein, and nonstructural protein 1 were detectable in immune peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the highest frequencies of DENV E-specific B cells detected in patients experiencing primary DENV-1 infections. DENV E-specific B cells were highly serotype-specific after primary DENV infections, whereas most E-specific B cells in patients with secondary infection were serotype-cross-reactive and secreted antibodies with higher avidity to heterologous DENV serotypes. Our data suggest that the minor populations of serotype-cross-reactive B cells generated by primary DENV infection are preferentially expanded during secondary DENV infection.

TI  - BHK cell proteins that bind to the 3' stem-loop structure of the West Nile virus genome RNA
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 69
SP  - 5650
EP  - 5658
AB  - The first 83 3' nucleotides of the genome RNA of the flavivirus West Nile encephalitis virus (WNV) form a stable stem-loop (SL) structure which is followed in the genome by a smaller SL. These 3' structures are highly conserved among divergent flaviviruses, suggesting that they may function as cis-acting signals for RNA replication and as such might specifically bind to cellular or viral proteins. Cellular proteins from uninfected and WNV-infected BHK-21 S100 cytoplasmic extracts formed three distinct complexes with the WNV plus-strand 3' SL [(+)3'SL] RNA in a gel mobility shift assay. Subsequent competitor gel shift analyses showed that two of these RNA-protein complexes, complexes 1 and 2, contained cell proteins that specifically bound to the WNV (+)3'SL RNA. UV-induced cross-linking and Northwestern blotting analyses detected WNV (+)3'SL RNA-binding proteins of 56, 84, and 105 kDa. When the S100 cytoplasmic extracts were partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography, a complex that comigrated with complex 1 was detected in fraction 19, while a complex that comigrated with complex 2 was detected in fraction 17. UV-induced cross-linking experiments indicated that an 84-kDa cell protein in fraction 17 and a 105-kDa protein in fraction 19 bound specifically to the WNV (+)3'SL RNA. In addition to binding to the (+)3'SL RNA, the 105-kDa protein bound to the SL structure located at the 3' end of the WNV minus-strand RNA. Initial mapping studies indicated that the 84- and 105-kDa proteins bind to different regions of the (+)3'SL RNA. The 3'-terminal SL RNA of another flavivirus, dengue virus type 3, specifically competed with the WNV (+)3'SL RNA in gel shift assays, suggesting that the host proteins identified in this study are flavivirus specific.

TI  - BPIFB3 Regulates Endoplasmic Reticulum Morphology To Facilitate Flavivirus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - Flaviviruses and other arthropod-transmitted viruses represent a widespread global health problem, with limited treatment options currently available. Thus, a better understanding of the cellular requirements for their infection is needed. Both DENV and ZIKV rely on expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the induction of autophagy to establish productive infections. However, little is known regarding the interplay between the requirements for autophagy initiation during infection and the mechanisms used by these viruses to avoid clearance through the autophagic pathway. Our study highlights the importance of the host factor BPIFB3 in regulating flavivirus replication and further confirms that the RETREG1-dependent reticulophagy pathway is antiviral to both DENV and ZIKV. ABSTRACT Flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), rely heavily on the availability of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes throughout their life cycle, and degradation of ER membranes restricts flavivirus replication. Accordingly, DENV and ZIKV restrict ER turnover by protease-mediated cleavage of reticulophagy regulator 1 (RETREG1), also known as FAM134B, an autophagy receptor responsible for targeted ER sheet degradation. Given that the induction of autophagy may play an important role in flavivirus replication, the antiviral role of RETREG1 suggests that specialized autophagic pathways may have differential effects on the flavivirus life cycle. We previously identified BPI fold-containing family B member 3 (BPIFB3) as a regulator of autophagy that negatively controls enterovirus replication. Here, we show that in contrast to enteroviruses, BPIFB3 functions as a positive regulator of DENV and ZIKV infection and that its RNA interference-mediated silencing inhibits the formation of viral replication organelles. Mechanistically, we show that depletion of BPIFB3 enhances RETREG1-dependent reticulophagy, leading to enhanced ER turnover and the suppression of viral replication. Consistent with this, the antiviral effects of BPIFB3 depletion can be reversed by RETREG1 silencing, suggesting a specific role for BPIFB3 in regulating ER turnover. These studies define BPIFB3 as a required host factor for both DENV and ZIKV replication and further contribute to our understanding of the requirements for autophagy during flavivirus infection. IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses and other arthropod-transmitted viruses represent a widespread global health problem, with limited treatment options currently available.

TI  - BPIFB3 facilitates flavivirus infection by controlling RETREG1-dependent reticulophagy
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The flavivirus genus, which includes dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), are significant human pathogens and the prevalence of infected vectors continues to geographically expand. Both DENV and ZIKV rely on expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the induction of autophagy to establish a productive viral infection. However, little is known regarding the interplay between the requirements for autophagy initiation during infection and the mechanisms used by these viruses to avoid clearance through the autophagic pathway. We recently showed that DENV and ZIKV inhibit reticulophagy (specific degradation of the ER through autophagy) by cleaving reticulophagy regulator 1 (RETREG1), an autophagy receptor responsible for targeted ER sheet degradation. These data suggest that DENV and ZIKV require specific autophagic pathways for their replication, while other autophagic pathways are antiviral. We previously identified BPI Fold Containing Family B Member 3 (BPIFB3) as a regulator of autophagy that negatively controls enterovirus replication. Here, we show that in contrast to enteroviruses, BPIFB3 functions as a positive regulator of DENV and ZIKV infection and that its RNAi-mediated silencing drastically inhibits the formation of viral replication organelles. We show that BPIFB3 depletion enhances ER fragmentation, while its overexpression protects against autophagy-induced ER degradation, demonstrating that BPIFB3 serves as a specific regulator of ER turnover. We further show that the antiviral effects of BPIFB3 depletion on flavivirus infection are reversed in RETREG1-depleted cells, and that BPIFB3 associates with RETREG1 within the ER, suggesting that BPIFB3 regulates a RETREG1-specific reticulophagy pathway. Collectively, these studies identify BPIFB3 as a regulator of the reticulophagy pathway and define the requirements for a novel host regulator of flavivirus infection. Author Summary Flaviviruses and other arthropod transmitted viruses represent a widespread global health problem with limited treatment options currently available. Thus, greater knowledge of the host factors required for replication and transmission is needed to provide a better understanding of the cellular requirements for infection. Here, we show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein, BPIFB3 is required to facilitate flavivirus infection. Depletion of BPIFB3 in cells inhibits dengue virus and Zika virus infection prior to replication of the viral genome. Mechanistically, we show that BPIFB3 inhibits ER degradation in an autophagy-specific manner and that loss of BPIFB3 decreases the availability of ER membranes needed for flavivirus replication. We further show that BPIFB3 specifically regulates the RETREG1 pathway, but not other pathways of ER turnover. Together, our data define a previously uncharacterized method of regulating ER degradation and show that BPIFB3 is an essential host factor for a productive flavivirus infection.

TI  - BST2/Tetherin Inhibits Dengue Virus Release from Human Hepatoma Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Type I interferons (IFN) have been shown to play an important role for inhibiting Dengue virus (DENV) infection. Identifying IFN-induced cellular proteins are essential for understanding its mechanisms against DENV. Here we established stable Huh7-derived cell lines expressing the IFN-induced cell membrane protein BST2 (Huh7-BST2) or its variant bearing a V5 tag at the C-terminal (Huh7-BST5CV5). These cell lines were infected with DENV to determine proteins modulating their anti-DENV response. We found that expression of BST2 did not affect the efficiency of DENV infection and intracellular replication. Rather, it significantly reduced the virion yield of the infected cells, particularly at low MOI infection. In addition, BST2 also decreased the foci formation and the size of infectious foci in cultured Huh7 monolayers with media containing methocellulose. The addition of the V5 tag at C-terminal inhibited the GPI modification of BST2 and blocked its shift from endoplasm to cytoplastic membrane. BST2CV5 did not affect DENV infection and foci formation in Huh7 cells but reduced virion yield by 1 log at low MOI infection. Interestingly, intracellular BST2CV5 expression was reduced by high level of DENV production. Conclusion Our results imply that BST2 is a functional mediator of the IFN response against DENV infection. BST2 inhibits the release of DENV virions from Huh7 cells and limits viral cell-to-cell transmission. BST2CV5 variant is unable to inhibit DENV release but impairs viral infection in cells.

Many viruses have developed sophisticated mechanisms to modulate these host PTMs, either by inhibiting the interferon pathway or by enhancing the stability and function of viral proteins essential for replication. In this Pearl, we review the literature on how flaviviruses are impacted by and exploit posttranslational modifications to their advantage.

TI  - Basal expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 drives intrinsic hepatocyte resistance to multiple RNA viruses
JF  - Nature microbiology
VL  - 4
SP  - 1096
EP  - 1104
AB  - Current models of cell-intrinsic immunity to RNA viruses centre on virus-triggered inducible antiviral responses initiated by RIG-I-like receptors or Toll-like receptors that sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and signal downstream through interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), transcription factors that induce synthesis of type I and type III interferons1. RNA viruses have evolved sophisticated strategies to disrupt these signalling pathways and evade elimination by cells, attesting to their importance2. Less attention has been paid to how IRFs maintain basal levels of protection against viruses. Here, we depleted antiviral factors linked to RIG-I-like receptor and Toll-like receptor signalling to map critical host pathways restricting positive-strand RNA virus replication in immortalized hepatocytes and identified an unexpected role for IRF1. We show that constitutively expressed IRF1 acts independently of mitochondrial antiviral signalling (MAVS) protein, IRF3 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-dependent signalling to provide intrinsic antiviral protection in actinomycin D-treated cells. IRF1 localizes to the nucleus, where it maintains the basal transcription of a suite of antiviral genes that protect against multiple pathogenic RNA viruses, including hepatitis A and C viruses, dengue virus and Zika virus. Our findings reveal an unappreciated layer of hepatocyte-intrinsic immunity to these positive-strand RNA viruses and identify previously unrecognized antiviral effector genes. Using a short-hairpin RNA-based depletion strategy coupled with high throughput RNA sequencing, the authors unravel a layer of intrinsic immunity to positive-strand RNA viruses in immortalized hepatocytes that relies on basal expression levels of interferon regulatory factor 1 maintaining the transcription of a suite of antiviral genes.

JF  - Traffic
VL  - 18
SP  - 218
EP  - 231
AB  - Dendritic cell‐specific intercellular adhesion molecule‐3‐grabbing non‐integrin (DC‐SIGN), a C‐type lectin expressed on the plasma membrane by human immature dendritic cells, is a receptor for numerous viruses including Ebola, SARS and dengue. A controversial question has been whether DC‐SIGN functions as a complete receptor for both binding and internalization of dengue virus (DENV) or whether it is solely a cell surface attachment factor, requiring either hand‐off to another receptor or a co‐receptor for internalization. To examine this question, we used 4 cell types: human immature dendritic cells and NIH3T3 cells expressing either wild‐type DC‐SIGN or 2 internalization‐deficient DC‐SIGN mutants, in which either the 3 cytoplasmic internalization motifs are silenced by alanine substitutions or the cytoplasmic region is truncated. Using confocal and super‐resolution imaging and high content single particle tracking, we investigated DENV binding, DC‐SIGN surface transport, endocytosis, as well as cell infectivity. DC‐SIGN was found colocalized with DENV inside cells suggesting hand‐off at the plasma membrane to another receptor did not occur. Moreover, all 3 DC‐SIGN molecules on NIH3T3 cells supported cell infection. These results imply the involvement of a co‐receptor because cells expressing the internalization‐deficient mutants could still be infected.

TI  - Beyond the Surface: Endocytosis of Mosquito-Borne Flaviviruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Flaviviruses are a group of positive-sense RNA viruses that are primarily transmitted through arthropod vectors and are capable of causing a broad spectrum of diseases. Many of the flaviviruses that are pathogenic in humans are transmitted specifically through mosquito vectors. Over the past century, many mosquito-borne flavivirus infections have emerged and re-emerged, and are of global importance with hundreds of millions of infections occurring yearly. There is a need for novel, effective, and accessible vaccines and antivirals capable of inhibiting flavivirus infection and ameliorating disease. The development of therapeutics targeting viral entry has long been a goal of antiviral research, but most efforts are hindered by the lack of broad-spectrum potency or toxicities associated with on-target effects, since many host proteins necessary for viral entry are also essential for host cell biology. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses generally enter cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), and recent studies suggest that a subset of these viruses can be internalized through a specialized form of CME that has additional dependencies distinct from canonical CME pathways, and antivirals targeting this pathway have been discovered. In this review, we discuss the role and contribution of endocytosis to mosquito-borne flavivirus entry as well as consider past and future efforts to target endocytosis for therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Binding mode of the activity‐modulating C‐terminal segment of NS2B to NS3 in the dengue virus NS2B–NS3 protease
JF  - The FEBS Journal
VL  - 281
AB  - The two‐component dengue virus NS2B–NS3 protease (NS2B–NS3pro) is an established drug target but inhibitor design is hampered by uncertainties about its 3D structure in solution. Crystal structures reported very different conformations for the functionally important C‐terminal segment of the NS2B cofactor (NS2Bc), indicating open and closed conformations in the absence and presence of inhibitors, respectively. An earlier NMR study in solution indicated that a closed state is the preferred conformation in the absence of an artificial linker engineered between NS2B and NS3pro. To obtain direct structural information on the fold of unlinked NS2B–NS3pro in solution, we tagged NS3pro with paramagnetic tags and measured pseudocontact shifts by NMR to position NS2Bc relative to NS3pro. NS2Bc was found to bind to NS3pro in the same way as reported in a previously published model and crystal structure of the closed state. The structure is destabilized, however, by high ionic strength and basic pH, showing the importance of electrostatic forces to tie NS2Bc to NS3pro. Narrow NMR signals previously thought to represent the open state are associated with protein degradation. In conclusion, the closed conformation of the NS2B–NS3 protease is the best model for structure‐guided drug design.

TI  - Binding of Flavivirus Nonstructural Protein NS1 to C4b Binding Protein Modulates Complement Activation
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 187
SP  - 424
EP  - 433
AB  - The complement system plays a pivotal protective role in the innate immune response to many pathogens including flaviviruses. Flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a secreted nonstructural glycoprotein that accumulates in plasma to high levels and is displayed on the surface of infected cells but absent from viral particles. Previous work has defined an immune evasion role of flavivirus NS1 in limiting complement activation by forming a complex with C1s and C4 to promote cleavage of C4 to C4b. In this study, we demonstrate a second mechanism, also involving C4 and its active fragment C4b, by which NS1 antagonizes complement activation. Dengue, West Nile, or yellow fever virus NS1 directly associated with C4b binding protein (C4BP), a complement regulatory plasma protein that attenuates the classical and lectin pathways. Soluble NS1 recruited C4BP to inactivate C4b in solution and on the plasma membrane. Mapping studies revealed that the interaction sites of NS1 on C4BP partially overlap with the C4b binding sites. Together, these studies further define the immune evasion potential of NS1 in reducing the functional capacity of C4 in complement activation and control of flavivirus infection.

VL  - 133 47
SP  - 19205
EP  - 15
AB  - The two-component dengue virus NS2B-NS3 protease (DEN NS2B-NS3pro) is an established drug target, but inhibitor design is hampered by the lack of a crystal structure of the protease in its fully active form. In solution and without inhibitors, the functionally important C-terminal segment of the NS2B cofactor is dissociated from DEN NS3pro ("open state"), necessitating a large structural change to produce the "closed state" thought to underpin activity. We analyzed the fold of DEN NS2B-NS3pro in solution with and without bound inhibitor by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Multiple paramagnetic lanthanide tags were attached to different sites to generate pseudocontact shifts (PCS). In the face of severe spectral overlap and broadening of many signals by conformational exchange, methods for assignment of (15)N-HSQC cross-peaks included selective mutation, combinatorial isotope labeling, and comparison of experimental PCSs and PCSs back-calculated for a structural model of the closed conformation built by using the structure of the related West Nile virus (WNV) protease as a template. The PCSs show that, in the presence of a positively charged low-molecular weight inhibitor, the enzyme assumes a closed state that is very similar to the closed state previously observed for the WNV protease. Therefore, a model of the protease built on the closed conformation of the WNV protease is a better template for rational drug design than available crystal structures, at least for positively charged inhibitors. To assess the open state, we created a binding site for a Gd(3+) complex and measured paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. The results show that the specific open conformation displayed in the crystal of DEN NS2B-NS3pro is barely populated in solution. The techniques used open an avenue to the fold analysis of proteins that yield poor NMR spectra, as PCSs from multiple sites in combination with model building generate powerful information even from incompletely assigned (15)N-HSQC spectra.

TI  - Biochemical characterization of AeD7L2 and its physiological relevance in blood feeding in the dengue mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti
JF  - The FEBS Journal
VL  - 288
AB  - Aedes aegypti saliva facilitates blood meal acquisition through pharmacologically active compounds that prevent host hemostasis. Among these salivary proteins are the D7s, which are highly abundant and have been shown to act as scavengers of biogenic amines and eicosanoids. In this work, we performed comparative structural modeling, characterized the binding capabilities, and assessed the physiological functions of the Ae. aegypti salivary protein AeD7L2 compared to the well‐characterized AeD7L1. AeD7L1 and AeD7L2 show different binding affinities to several biogenic amines and biolipids involved in host hemostasis. Interestingly, AeD7L2 tightly binds U‐46619, the stable analog of thromboxane A2 (KD = 69.4 nm), which is an important platelet aggregation mediator, while AeD7L1 shows no binding. We tested the ability of these proteins to interfere with the three branches of hemostasis: vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and blood coagulation. Pressure myography experiments showed these two proteins reversed isolated resistance artery vasoconstriction induced by either norepinephrine or U‐46619. These proteins also inhibited platelet aggregation induced by low doses of collagen or U‐46619. However, D7 long proteins did not affect blood coagulation. The different ligand specificity and affinities of AeD7L1 and AeD7L2 matched our experimental observations from studying their effects on vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation, which confirm their role in preventing host hemostasis. This work highlights the complex yet highly specific biological activities of mosquito salivary proteins and serves as another example of the sophisticated biology underlying arthropod blood feeding.

AB  - The flavivirus RNA genome contains a conserved cap-1 structure, (7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)G, at the 5' end. Two mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase) activities involved in the formation of the cap, the (guanine-N7)- and the (nucleoside-2'O)-MTases (2'O-MTase), reside in a single domain of non-structural protein NS5 (NS5MTase). This study reports on the biochemical characterization of the 2'O-MTase activity of NS5MTase of dengue virus (NS5MTase(DV)) using purified, short, capped RNA substrates ((7Me)GpppAC(n) or GpppAC(n)). NS5MTase(DV) methylated both types of substrate exclusively at the 2'O position. The efficiency of 2'O-methylation did not depend on the methylation of the N7 position. Using (7Me)GpppAC(n) and GpppAC(n) substrates of increasing chain lengths, it was found that both NS5MTase(DV) 2'O activity and substrate binding increased before reaching a plateau at n=5. Thus, the cap and 6 nt might define the interface providing efficient binding of enzyme and substrate. K(m) values for (7Me)GpppAC(5) and the co-substrate S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) were determined (0.39 and 3.26 microM, respectively). As reported for other AdoMet-dependent RNA and DNA MTases, the 2'O-MTase activity of NS5MTase(DV) showed a low turnover of 3.25x10(-4) s(-1). Finally, an inhibition assay was set up and tested on GTP and AdoMet analogues as putative inhibitors of NS5MTase(DV), which confirmed efficient inhibition by the reaction product S-adenosyl-homocysteine (IC(50) 0.34 microM) and sinefungin (IC(50) 0.63 microM), demonstrating that the assay is sufficiently sensitive to conduct inhibitor screening and characterization assays.

AB  - Flaviviruses, such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, are critically important human pathogens that sicken a staggeringly high number of humans every year. Most of these pathogens are transmitted by mosquitos, and not surprisingly, as the earth warms and human populations grow and move, their geographic reach is increasing. Flaviviruses are simple RNA-protein machines that carry out protein synthesis, genome replication, and virion packaging in close association with cellular lipid membranes. In this review, we examine the molecular biology of flaviviruses touching on the structure and function of viral components and how these interact with host factors. The latter are functionally divided into pro-viral and antiviral factors, both of which, not surprisingly, include many RNA binding proteins. In the interface between the virus and the hosts we highlight the role of a noncoding RNA produced by flaviviruses to impair antiviral host immune responses. Throughout the review, we highlight areas of intense investigation, or a need for it, and potential targets and tools to consider in the important battle against pathogenic flaviviruses.

TI  - Blockade of dengue virus infection and viral cytotoxicity in neuronal cells in vitro and in vivo by targeting endocytic pathways
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection in neuronal cells was speculated to trigger neuropathy. Herein, we determined the blockade of DENV infection by targeting endocytic pathways in vitro and in vivo. In DENV-infected mouse brains, we previously showed that viral proteins are expressed in neuronal cells around the hippocampus with accompanying neurotoxicity. DENV caused infection, including entry, double-stranded (ds)RNA replication, protein expression, and virus release, followed by cytotoxicity in the mouse neuronal Neuro-2a cell line. Pharmacologically blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the DENV retarded viral replication. Targeting vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase)-based endosomal acidification effectively blocked the DENV replication process, but had no direct effect on viral translation. Blockade of the clathrin- and V-ATPase-based endocytic pathways also attenuated DENV-induced neurotoxicity. Inhibiting endosomal acidification effectively retarded DENV infection, acute viral encephalitis, and mortality. These results demonstrate that clathrin mediated endocytosis of DENV followed by endosomal acidification-dependent viral replication in neuronal cells, which can lead to neurotoxicity.

AB  - Why certain individuals progress to severe dengue disease is unknown. In this study, blood groups associated with dengue disease were investigated. ABO phenotypes were identified by use of serum from 399 patients with dengue-virus infection who participated in a cohort study. ABO blood-group frequencies were similar in primary versus secondary dengue-virus infections. However, in secondary infection, individuals with blood group AB were likely to have dengue hemorrhagic fever grade 3 than either grades 1 and 2 combined (corrected P value, <.0001; odds ratio, 0.097 [95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.33]) or dengue fever (corrected P value, <.0001; odds ratio, 0.119 [95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.37]). To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating an association between ABO blood group and the severity of dengue disease.

AB  - This study was designed to determine if infection of Aedes aegypti with dengue-2 virus affects the ability of the mosquito to efficiently locate and imbibe blood from an uninfected host. Previous studies suggest that some parasites manipulate their arthropod host to increase the probability of transmission by interfering with blood-feeding efficiency. We found no evidence that dengue-2 virus infection by intrathoracic inoculation impaired the blood-feeding efficiency of Ae. aegypti. We speculate that natural selection has not favored the evolution of dengue viruses that increase vector probing time because uninfected Ae. aegypti take multiple blood meals during each gonotrophic cycle and further increases in vector probing would not significantly increase virus fitness.

TI  - Bloodmeals fuel dengue virus replication in the female mosquito Aedes aegypti
JF  - Journal of Virology
AB  - ABSTRACT Vector competence defines the ability of a vector to acquire, host, and transmit a pathogen. Understanding the molecular determinants of the mosquitos’ competence to host dengue virus (DENV) holds promise to prevent its transmission. To this end, we employed RNA-seq to profile mRNA transcripts of the female Aedes aegypti mosquitos feeding on naïve vs viremic mouse. While most transcripts (12,634) did not change their abundances, 360 transcripts showed decreases. Biological pathway analysis revealed representatives of the decreased transcripts involved in the wnt signaling pathway and hippo signaling pathway. One thousand three hundred fourteen transcripts showed increases in abundance and participate in 21 biological pathways including amino acid metabolism, carbon metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation with antimycin A reduced oxidative phosphorylation activity and ATP concentration associated with reduced DENV replication in the Aedes aegypti cells. Antimycin A did not affect the amounts of the non-structural proteins 3 and 5, two major components of the replication complex. Ribavirin, an agent that reduces GTP concentration, recapitulated the effects of reduced ATP concentration on DENV replication. Knocking down one of the oxidative phosphorylation components, ATP synthase subunit β, reduced DENV replication in the mosquitos. In summary, our results suggest that DENV enhances metabolic pathways in the female Aedes aegypti mosquitos to supply nutrients and energy for virus replication. ATP synthase subunit β knockdown might be exploited to reduce the mosquitos’ competence to host and transmit DENV. IMPORTANCE Through evolution, the mosquito-borne viruses have adapted to the blood-feeding behaviors of their opportunist hosts to fulfill a complete lifecycle in humans and mosquitos. Disruption in the mosquitos’ ability to host these viruses offers strategies to prevent diseases caused by them. With the advent of genomic tools, we discovered that dengue virus (DENV) benefited from the female mosquitos’ bloodmeals for metabolic and energetic supplies for replication. Chemical or genetic disruption in these supplies reduced DENV replication in the female mosquitos. Our discovery can be exploited to produce genetically modified mosquitos, in which DENV infection leads to disruption in the supplies and thereby reduces replication and transmission. Our discovery might be extrapolated to prevent mosquito-borne virus transmission and the diseases they cause. Through evolution, the mosquito-borne viruses have adapted to the blood-feeding behaviors of their opportunist hosts to fulfill a complete lifecycle in humans and mosquitos. Disruption in the mosquitos’ ability to host these viruses offers strategies to prevent diseases caused by them. With the advent of genomic tools, we discovered that dengue virus (DENV) benefited from the female mosquitos’ bloodmeals for metabolic and energetic supplies for replication. Chemical or genetic disruption in these supplies reduced DENV replication in the female mosquitos. Our discovery can be exploited to produce genetically modified mosquitos, in which DENV infection leads to disruption in the supplies and thereby reduces replication and transmission. Our discovery might be extrapolated to prevent mosquito-borne virus transmission and the diseases they cause.

TI  - Both CXCR3 and CXCL10/IFN-Inducible Protein 10 Are Required for Resistance to Primary Infection by Dengue Virus1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 177
SP  - 1855
EP  - 1863
AB  - We examined the extent to which CXCR3 mediates resistance to dengue infection. Following intracerebral infection with dengue virus, CXCR3-deficient (CXCR3−/−) mice showed significantly higher mortality rates than wild-type (WT) mice; moreover, surviving CXCR3−/− mice, but not WT mice, often developed severe hind-limb paralysis. The brains of CXCR3−/− mice showed higher viral loads than those of WT mice, and quantitative analysis using real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry revealed fewer T cells, CD8+ T cells in particular, in the brains of CXCR3−/− mice. This suggests that recruitment of effector T cells to sites of dengue infection was diminished in CXCR3−/− mice, which impaired elimination of the virus from the brain and thus increased the likelihood of paralysis and/or death. These results indicate that CXCR3 plays a protective rather than an immunopathological role in dengue virus infection. In studies to identify critical CXCR3 ligands, CXCL10/IFN-inducible protein 10-deficient (CXCL10/IP-10−/−) mice infected with dengue virus showed a higher mortality rate than that of the CXCR3−/− mice. Although CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL9/monokine induced by IFN-γ, and CXCL11/IFN-inducible T cell α chemoattractant share a single receptor and all three of these chemokines are induced by dengue virus infection, the latter two could not compensate for the absence of CXCL10/IP-10 in this in vivo model. Our results suggest that both CXCR3 and CXCL10/IP-10 contribute to resistance against primary dengue virus infection and that chemokines that are indistinguishable in in vitro assays differ in their activities in vivo.

TI  - Both E Protein Glycans Adversely Affect Dengue Virus Infectivity but Are Beneficial for Virion Release
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 5171
EP  - 5180
AB  - ABSTRACT The E protein of most flaviviruses is modified by Asn-linked glycosylation at residue 153/154 and in the case of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes by a second glycan at residue 67. However, the absence of E protein glycosylation among numerous natural isolates of different flaviviruses suggests that the glycan, per se, is not critically important in the virus life cycle. Consistent with this notion, we show that ablation of both glycans from the DENV-2 E protein reduces but does not prevent growth of the variant in mammalian and mosquito cells. We found a pronounced and opposing effect of glycan ablation on two stages of the virus growth cycle: infectivity and release. Loss of either of the two DENV E protein glycans markedly enhanced infectivity of variants for mosquito cells at the expense of efficient virion release. The variants also displayed reduced release in mammalian cells, which was more prominent for viruses lacking the Asn 67-linked glycan than for those lacking the Asn 153-linked glycan, without a marked change in infectivity. Mutations, which compensated for the defect in virus morphogenesis associated with ablation of the Asn 67-linked glycan in mammalian cells but interestingly not in mosquito cells, were identified at the glycosylation acceptor motif and a second site in E protein domain II. The dueling influences of infectivity and release on virus growth affected by the glycans may explain the plasticity in E protein glycosylation among the flaviviruses.

TI  - Both nonstructural proteins NS2B and NS3 are required for the proteolytic processing of dengue virus nonstructural proteins
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 65
SP  - 2467
EP  - 2475
AB  - The cleavages at the junctions of the flavivirus nonstructural (NS) proteins NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, NS3/NS4A, and NS4B/NS5 share an amino acid sequence motif and are presumably catalyzed by a virus-encoded protease. We constructed recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing various portions of the NS region of the dengue virus type 4 polyprotein. By analyzing immune precipitates of 35S-labeled lysates of recombinant virus-infected cells, we could monitor the NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, and NS3/NS4A cleavages. A polyprotein composed of NS2A, NS2B, and the N-terminal 184 amino acids of NS3 was cleaved at the NS2A/NS2B and NS2B/NS3 junctions, whereas a similar polyprotein containing only the first 77 amino acids of NS3 was not cleaved. This finding is consistent with the proposal that the N-terminal 180 amino acids of NS3 constitute a protease domain. Polyproteins containing NS2A and NS3 with large in-frame deletions of NS2B were not cleaved at the NS2A/NS2B or NS2B/NS3 junctions. Coinfection with a recombinant expressing NS2B complemented these NS2B deletions for NS2B/NS3 cleavage and probably also for NS2A/NS2B cleavage. Thus, NS2B is also required for the NS2A/NS2B and NS2B/NS3 cleavages and can act in trans. Other experiments showed that NS2B was needed, apparently in cis, for NS3/NS4A cleavage and for a series of internal cleavages in NS3. Indirect evidence that NS3 can also act in trans was obtained. Models are discussed for a two-component protease activity requiring both NS2B and NS3.

TI  - Bruton's tyrosine kinase phosphorylates Toll-like receptor 3 to initiate antiviral response
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 109
SP  - 5791
EP  - 5796
AB  - Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) mediates antiviral response by recognizing double-stranded RNA. Its cytoplasmic domain is tyrosine phosphorylated upon ligand binding and initiates downstream signaling via the adapter TIR-containing adaptor inducing interferon–β (TRIF). However, the kinase responsible for TLR3 phosphorylation remains unknown. We show here that Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)-deficient macrophages failed to secrete inflammatory cytokines and IFN-β upon TLR3 stimulation and were impaired in clearing intracellular dengue virus infection. Mutant mice were also less susceptible to d-galactosamine/p(I:C)-induced sepsis. In the absence of BTK, TLR3-induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT and MAPK signaling and activation of NFκB, IRF3, and AP-1 transcription factors were all defective. We demonstrate that BTK directly phosphorylates TLR3 and in particular the critical Tyr759 residue. BTK point mutations that abrogate or led to constitutive kinase activity have opposite effects on TLR3 phosphorylation. Loss of BTK also compromises the formation of the downstream TRIF/receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1)/TBK1 complex. Thus, BTK plays a critical role in initiating TLR3 signaling.

TI  - Bystander T cells in human immune responses to dengue antigens
JF  - BMC Immunology
VL  - 11
SP  - 47
EP  - 47
AB  - BackgroundPrevious studies of T cell activation in dengue infection have focused on restriction of specific T cell receptors (TCRs) and classical MHC molecules. However, bystander T cell activation, which is TCR independent, occurs via cytokines in other viral infections, both in vitro and in vivo, and enables T cells to bypass certain control checkpoints. Moreover, clinical and pathological evidence has pointed to cytokines as the mediators of dengue disease severity. Therefore, we investigated bystander T cell induction by dengue viral antigen.ResultsWhole blood samples from 55 Thai schoolchildren aged 13-14 years were assayed for in vitro interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) induction in response to inactivated dengue serotype 2 antigen (Den2). The contribution of TCR-dependent and independent pathways was tested by treatment with cyclosporin A (CsA), which inhibits TCR-dependent activation of T cells. ELISA results revealed that approximately 72% of IFN-γ production occurred via the TCR-dependent pathway. The major IFN-γ sources were natural killer (NK) (mean ± SE = 55.2 ± 3.3), CD4+T (24.5 ± 3.3) and CD8+T cells (17.9 ± 1.5), respectively, as demonstrated by four-color flow cytometry. Interestingly, in addition to these cells, we found CsA-resistant IFN-γ producing T cells (CD4+T = 26.9 ± 3.6% and CD8+T = 20.3 ± 2.1%) implying the existence of activated bystander T cells in response to dengue antigen in vitro. These bystander CD4+ and CD8+T cells had similar kinetics to NK cells, appeared after 12 h and were inhibited by anti-IL-12 neutralization indicating cytokine involvement.ConclusionsThis study described immune cell profiles and highlighted bystander T cell activation in response to dengue viral antigens of healthy people in an endemic area. Further studies on bystander T cell activation in dengue viral infection may reveal the immune mechanisms that protect or enhance pathogenesis of secondary dengue infection.

TI  - C-Terminal Helical Domains of Dengue Virus Type 4 E Protein Affect the Expression/Stability of prM Protein and Conformation of prM and E Proteins
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Background The envelope (E) protein of dengue virus (DENV) is the major immunogen for dengue vaccine development. At the C-terminus are two α-helices (EH1 and EH2) and two transmembrane domains (ET1 and ET2). After synthesis, E protein forms a heterodimer with the precursor membrane (prM) protein, which has been shown as a chaperone for E protein and could prevent premature fusion of E protein during maturation. Recent reports of enhancement of DENV infectivity by anti-prM monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suggest the presence of prM protein in dengue vaccine is potentially harmful. A better understanding of prM-E interaction and its effect on recognition of E and prM proteins by different antibodies would provide important information for future design of safe and effective subunit dengue vaccines. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we examined a series of C-terminal truncation constructs of DENV4 prME, E and prM. In the absence of E protein, prM protein expressed poorly. In the presence of E protein, the expression of prM protein increased in a dose-dependent manner. Radioimmunoprecipitation, sucrose gradient sedimentation and pulse-chase experiments revealed ET1 and EH2 were involved in prM-E interaction and EH2 in maintaining the stability of prM protein. Dot blot assay revealed E protein affected the recognition of prM protein by an anti-prM mAb; truncation of EH2 or EH1 affected the recognition of E protein by several anti-E mAbs, which was further verified by capture ELISA. The E protein ectodomain alone can be recognized well by all anti-E mAbs tested. Conclusions/Significance A C-terminal domain (EH2) of DENV E protein can affect the expression and stability of its chaperone prM protein. These findings not only add to our understanding of the interaction between prM and E proteins, but also suggest the ectodomain of E protein alone could be a potential subunit immunogen without inducing anti-prM response.

TI  - C-Type Lectin Receptors in Antiviral Immunity and Viral Escape
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 9
AB  - C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are important pattern recognition receptors involved in recognition and induction of adaptive immunity to pathogens. Certain CLRs play an important role in viral infections as they efficiently interact with viruses. However, it has become clear that deadly viruses subvert the function of CLRs to escape antiviral immunity and promote infection. In particular, viruses target CLRs to suppress or modulate type I interferons that play a central role in the innate and adaptive defense against viruses. In this review, we discuss the function of CLRs in binding to enveloped viruses like HIV-1 and Dengue virus, and how uptake and signaling cascades have decisive effects on the outcome of infection.

TI  - C-terminal region of dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 is involved in endothelial cell cross-reactivity via molecular mimicry
JF  - American Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 4
SP  - 85
EP  - 91
AB  - Infection with dengue virus (DV) causes diseases ranging from self-limited dengue fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Vascular leakage, thrombocytopenia and bleeding are the clinical manifestations associated with dengue hemorrhage. We previously showed that anti-DV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antibodies (Abs) cross-reacted with endothelial cells. The potential target proteins on endothelial cell surface recognized by anti-DV NS1 Abs showed sequence homology with the C-terminal amino acids (a.a.) 311-352 of DV NS1. In this study, the role of NS1 C-terminal region in dengue autoimmunity was investigated. We deleted the a.a. 277-352 of DV NS1 to prepare truncated NS1 (tNS1) and generated anti-DV tNS1 Abs in mice. The endothelial cell-binding activity of anti-DV tNS1 Abs was lower than that of anti-DV NS1 Abs. In addition, the endothelial cell-binding activity of anti-DV NS1 Abs was inhibited by preabsorption with DV NS1 but not with DV tNS1 proteins. The anti-P311 (a.a. 311-330) and anti-P331 (a.a. 331-350) titers of dengue patient sera were positively correlated with their endothelial cell-binding activity. Dengue patient sera showed lower binding activity to DV tNS1 than to DV NS1 proteins. The endothelial cell-binding activity of dengue patient sera was inhibited by preabsorption with P311 and P331. This study helps to understand the molecular mechanisms of autoimmunity mediated by anti-DV NS1 Abs and to provide the potential implications of tNS1 in dengue vaccine strategies.

TI  - C-type lectins and extracellular vesicles in virus-induced NETosis
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 28
AB  - Dysregulated formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is observed in acute viral infections. Moreover, NETs contribute to the pathogenesis of acute viral infections, including those caused by the dengue virus (DV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, excessive NET formation (NETosis) is associated with disease severity in patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2-induced multiple organ injuries. Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and other members of C-type lectin family (L-SIGN, LSECtin, CLEC10A) have been reported to interact with viral glycans to facilitate virus spreading and exacerbates inflammatory reactions. Moreover, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)-coupled C-type lectin member 5A (CLEC5A) has been shown as the pattern recognition receptor for members of flaviviruses, and is responsible for DV-induced cytokine storm and Japanese encephalomyelitis virus (JEV)-induced neuronal inflammation. Moreover, DV activates platelets via CLEC2 to release extracellular vesicles (EVs), including microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes (EXOs). The DV-activated EXOs (DV-EXOs) and MVs (DV-MVs) stimulate CLEC5A and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), respectively, to enhance NET formation and inflammatory reactions. Thus, EVs from virus-activated platelets (PLT-EVs) are potent endogenous danger signals, and blockade of C-type lectins is a promising strategy to attenuate virus-induced NETosis and intravascular coagulopathy.

TI  - CD300 receptor family in viral infections
JF  - European Journal of Immunology
VL  - 49
AB  - The CD300 molecules constitute an evolutionarily significant family of receptors that are expressed on myeloid and lymphoid cells, but also on other cell types, such as tuft cells. Many of the CD300 receptors have been shown to recognize lipids, e.g. phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Over the past couple of years, accumulating evidence has shown that this family of receptors is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Specifically, CD300 molecules participate in the mechanisms that viruses employ to develop immune evasion strategies and to infect host cells. The participation of CD300 molecules in viral infection includes both lipid dependent and independent mechanisms, as for example in infections with dengue virus (DENV) and murine norovirus (MNV), respectively. CD300 receptors are also involved in viral escape mechanisms, for instance inhibiting NK cell‐mediated cytotoxicity against infected cells. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly recognized that the expression of CD300 receptors is altered during viral diseases. Here, we review the involvement of human and murine CD300 molecules in viral binding and entry and in cellular responses to viruses, which highlights the potential of CD300 molecules in the search of new biomarkers for various stages of infection and therapeutic targets for the treatment of viral infections.

TI  - CD4+ and CD8+ T‐cell immunity to Dengue – lessons for the study of Zika virus
JF  - Immunology
VL  - 150
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are rapidly emerging mosquito‐borne flaviviruses that represent a public health concern. Understanding host protective immunity to these viruses is critical for the design of optimal vaccines. Over a decade of research has highlighted a significant contribution of the T‐cell response to both protection and/or disease enhancement during DENV infection, the latter being mainly associated with sub‐optimal cross‐reactive T‐cell responses during secondary infections. Phase IIb/III clinical trials of the first licensed tetravalent dengue vaccine highlight increased vaccine efficacy in dengue‐immune as opposed to dengue‐naive vaccinees, suggesting a possible immunoprotective role of pre‐existing DENV‐specific T cells that are boosted upon vaccination. No vaccine is available for ZIKV and little is known about the T‐cell response to this virus. ZIKV and DENV are closely related viruses with a sequence identity ranging from 44% and 56% for the structural proteins capsid and envelope to 68% for the more conserved non‐structural proteins NS3/NS5, which represent the main targets of the CD4+ and CD8+ T‐cell response to DENV, respectively. In this review we discuss our current knowledge of T‐cell immunity to DENV and what it can teach us for the study of ZIKV. The extent of T‐cell cross‐reactivity towards ZIKV of pre‐existing DENV‐specific memory T cells and its potential impact on protective immunity and/or immunopathology will also be discussed.

TI  - CD40 Ligand Enhances Dengue Viral Infection of Dendritic Cells: A Possible Mechanism for T Cell-Mediated Immunopathology12
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 177

EP  - 6503
AB  - We have previously shown that dengue virus (DV) productively infects immature human dendritic cells (DCs) through binding to cell surface DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin molecules. Infected DCs are apoptotic, refractory to TNF-α stimulation, inhibited from undergoing maturation, and unable to stimulate T cells. In this study, we show that maturation of infected DCs could be restored by a strong stimulus, CD40L. Addition of CD40L significantly reduced apoptosis of DCs, promoted IL-12 production, and greatly elevated the IFN-γ response of T cells, but yet did not restore T cell proliferation in MLR. Increased viral infection of DCs was also observed; however, increased infection did not appear to be mediated by DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin, but rather was regulated by decreased production of IFN-α and decreased apoptotic death of infected DCs. Because CD40L is highly expressed on activated memory (but not naive) T cells, the observation that CD40L signaling results in enhanced DV infection of DC suggests a possible T cell-dependent mechanism for the immune-mediated enhancement of disease severity associated with some secondary dengue infections.

TI  - CD8+ T Cell Serotype-Cross-Reactivity is a Predominant Feature of Dengue Virus Infections in Humans: A Dissertation
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV 1-4) have a significant and growing impact on global health. Dengue disease encompasses a wide range of clinical symptoms, usually presenting as an uncomplicated febrile illness lasting 5-7 days; however, a small percentage of infections are associated with plasma leakage and bleeding tendency (called dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF), which can result in shock. Epidemiological studies indicate that severe dengue disease most often occurs during secondary heterotypic DENV infection. Additionally, plasma leakage (the hallmark of DHF) coincides with defervescence and viral clearance, suggesting that severe disease arises from the immune response to infection rather than a direct effect of the virus. A number of studies have found increased levels of markers of immune cell activation in patients with DHF compared to patients with the less severe form of disease (DF). These markers include IFNγ, TNFα, soluble CD8, soluble IL-2 receptor, soluble TNF receptor, and CD69, which support a role for T cells in mediating immunopathology. Because of the high homology of DENV 1-4, some degree of serotype-cross-reactivity is seen for most T cell epitopes. A high percentage of DENVspecific T cells recognize multiple DENV serotypes, as demonstrated by peptide-MHC (pMHC) tetramer binding and in vitro functional assays performed on PBMC from subjects vaccinated with an experimental DENV vaccine or naturally-infected subjects with secondary (>1) DENV infection.

TI  - CD8+ T Lymphocyte Expansion, Proliferation and Activation in Dengue Fever
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 9
AB  - Dengue fever induces a robust immune response, including massive T cell activation. The level of T cell activation may, however, be associated with more severe disease. In this study, we explored the level of CD8+ T lymphocyte activation in the first six days after onset of symptoms during a DENV2 outbreak in early 2010 on the coast of São Paulo State, Brazil. Using flow cytometry we detected a progressive increase in the percentage of CD8+ T cells in 74 dengue fever cases. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 cases were thawed and evaluated using expanded phenotyping. The expansion of the CD8+ T cells was coupled with increased Ki67 expression. Cell activation was observed later in the course of disease, as determined by the expression of the activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR. This increased CD8+ T lymphocyte activation was observed in all memory subsets, but was more pronounced in the effector memory subset, as defined by higher CD38 expression. Our results show that most CD8+ T cell subsets are expanded during DENV2 infection and that the effector memory subset is the predominantly affected sub population.

TI  - CLEC2 and CLEC5A: Pathogenic Host Factors in Acute Viral Infections
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 10
AB  - The protective roles of endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic nucleic acid sensors are well elucidated, but the pathogenic host factors during viral infections remain unclear. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)-coupled C-type lectins (CLECs) CLEC2 and CLEC5A are highly expressed on platelets and myeloid cells, respectively. CLEC2 has been shown to recognize snake venom aggretin and the endogenous ligand podoplanin and acts as a critical regulator in the development and immunothrombosis. Although CLEC2 has been reported to interact with type I immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), its role in viral infections is still unclear. CLEC5A binds to fucose and mannose moieties of dengue virus membrane glycans, as well as to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)/N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) disaccharides that form the backbone of L. monocytogenes peptidoglycans. Recently, we demonstrated that both CLEC2 and CLEC5A are critical in microbe-induced “neutrophil extracellular trap” (NET) formation and proinflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, activation of CLEC2 by dengue virus (DV) and H5N1 influenza virus (IAV) induces the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which further enhance NETosis and proinflammatory cytokine production via CLEC5A and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). These findings not only illustrate the immunomodulatory effects of EVs during platelet-leukocyte interactions, but also demonstrate the critical roles of CLEC2 and CLEC5A in acute viral infections.

TI  - CLEC5A is critical for dengue virus-induced inflammasome activation in human macrophages.
JF  - Blood
VL  - 121 1
SP  - 95
EP  - 106
AB  - Persistent high fever is one of the most typical clinical symptoms in dengue virus (DV)-infected patients. However, the source of endogenous pyrogen (eg, IL-1β) and the signaling cascade leading to the activation of inflammasome and caspase-1, which are essential for IL-1β and IL-18 secretion, during dengue infection have not been elucidated yet. Macrophages can be polarized into distinct phenotypes under the influence of GM-CSF or M-CSF, denoted as GM-Mϕ and M-Mϕ, respectively. We found that DV induced high levels of IL-1β and IL-18 from GM-Mϕ (inflammatory macrophage) and caused cell death (pyroptosis), whereas M-Mϕ (resting macrophage) did not produce IL-1β and IL-18 on DV infection even with lipopolysaccharide priming. This observation demonstrates the distinct responses of GM-Mϕ and M-Mϕ to DV infection. Moreover, up-regulation of pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and NLRP3 associated with caspase-1 activation was observed in DV-infected GM-Mϕ, whereas blockade of CLEC5A/MDL-1, a C-type lectin critical for dengue hemorrhagic fever and Japanese encephalitis virus infection, inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyrotopsis in GM-Mϕ. Thus, DV can activate NLRP3 inflammasome via CLEC5A, and GM-Mϕ plays a more important role than M-Mϕ in the pathogenesis of DV infection.

TI  - CLEC5A is critical for dengue virus-induced osteoclast activation and bone homeostasis
JF  - Journal of Molecular Medicine
VL  - 94
SP  - 1025
EP  - 1037
AB  - Osteoclasts are bone tissue macrophages critical to maintain bone homeostasis. However, whether osteoclasts are susceptible to flaviviral infections and involved in dengue virus (DV)-induced disease pathogenesis is still unknown. In this study, we found that osteoclasts were preferentially susceptible to DV infection and produced similar amounts of cytokines and infectious virions as macrophages. Interestingly, DV-induced cytokine secretion and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFATc1 in osteoclast via the Syk-coupled myeloid C-type lectin member 5A (CLEC5A). Moreover, DV caused transient inflammatory reaction in bone tissue and upregulated osteolytic activity to release C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-1) from bone tissue. Furthermore, DV-induced osteolytic activity was attenuated in CLEC5A-deficient mice, and administration of antagonistic anti-CLEC5A mAb inhibited DV-activated osteolytic activity and reduced CTX-1 serum level in vivo. This observation suggests that osteoclasts serve as a novel target for DV, and transient upregulation of osteolytic activity may contribute to the clinical symptoms in dengue patients. Cultured osteoclasts were susceptible to DV infection. Osteoclasts produced similar amounts of cytokines and infectious virions as macrophages. DV induced nuclear translocation of NFATc1 in osteoclast via CLEC5A. DV caused transient inflammatory reaction in bone tissue and upregulated osteolytic activity. Antagonistic anti-CLEC5A mAb inhibited DV-activated osteolytic activity in vivo. Cultured osteoclasts were susceptible to DV infection.

JF  - Lectin in Host Defense Against Microbial Infections
VL  - 1204
SP  - 57
EP  - 73
AB  - CLEC5A is a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)-coupled C-type lectin that is highly expressed by monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells and interacts with virions directly, via terminal fucose and mannose moieties of viral glycans. CLEC5A also binds to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) disaccharides of bacterial cell walls. Compared to other C-type lectins (DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR) and TLRs, CLEC5A binds its ligands with relatively low affinities. However, CLEC5A forms a multivalent hetero-complex with DC-SIGN and other C-type lectins upon engagement with ligands, and thereby mediates microbe-induced inflammatory responses via activation of Syk. For example, in vivo studies in mouse models have demonstrated that CLEC5A is responsible for flaviviruses-induced hemorrhagic shock and neuroinflammation, and a CLEC5A polymorphism in humans is associated with disease severity following infection with dengue virus. In addition, CLEC5A is co-activated with TLR2 by Listeria and Staphylococcus. Furthermore, CLEC5A-postive myeloid cells are responsible for Concanavilin A-induced aseptic inflammatory reactions. Thus, CLEC5A is a promiscuous pattern recognition receptor in myeloid cells and is a potential therapeutic target for attenuation of both septic and aseptic inflammatory reactions.

TI  - CNS Immune Profiling in a Dengue Virus-Infected Immunocompetent Outbred ICR Mice Strain
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection in the brain causes severe dengue disease with neuropathic complications. In addition to viral effects, immunogenic or pathogenic central nervous system (CNS) inflammation can be induced during DENV infection. By using an immunocompetent outbred ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) mouse model for investigating CNS immunity upon DENV infection, we conducted single-panel immune cell profiling and a multiplex cytokine assay. The ICR mice infected with DENV presented with progressive hunchback posture, limbic seizures, limbic weakness, paralysis, and lethality. When the virions were released, the viral non-structural protein 1 was expressed in the brain in a time-dependent manner. Isolated brain CD45-positive cells revealed a significant population of resident CD14-positive cells, which was considerably decreased 8 days post-infection. We found an unexpected time-kinetic decrease in CD19-positive cells and CD11c/MHC II-positive cells and an increase in NK1.1-positive cells. Further assays showed the time-dependent induction of proinflammatory and NK1.1-associated cytokines in the DENV-infected brains. These results indicate a CNS immune profile of DENV infection and hypothetical CNS immunity in response to DENV infection.

JF  - Viruses
VL  - 6
SP  - 5028
EP  - 5046
AB  - Aedes aegypti is a principal vector responsible for the transmission of dengue viruses (DENV). To date, vector control remains the key option for dengue disease management. To develop new vector control strategies, a more comprehensive understanding of the biological interactions between DENV and Ae. aegypti is required. In this study, a cDNA library derived from the midgut of female adult Ae. aegypti was used in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screenings against DENV2 envelope (E) protein. Among the many interacting proteins identified, carboxypeptidase B1 (CPB1) was selected, and its biological interaction with E protein in Ae. aegypti primary midgut cells was further validated. Our double immunofluorescent assay showed that CPB1-E interaction occurred in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the Ae. aegypti primary midgut cells. Overexpression of CPB1 in mosquito cells resulted in intracellular DENV2 genomic RNA or virus particle accumulation, with a lower amount of virus release. Therefore, we postulated that in Ae. aegypti midgut cells, CPB1 binds to the E protein deposited on the ER intraluminal membranes and inhibits DENV2 RNA encapsulation, thus inhibiting budding from the ER, and may interfere with immature virus transportation to the trans-Golgi network.

TI  - CRISPR Screen Reveals PACT as a Pro-Viral Factor for Dengue Viral Replication
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - The dengue virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that infects ~400 million people worldwide. Currently, there are no approved antivirals available. CRISPR-based screening methods have greatly accelerated the discovery of host factors that are essential for DENV infection and that can be targeted in host-directed antiviral interventions. In the present study, we performed a focused CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats) library screen to discover the key host factors that are essential for DENV infection in human Huh7 cells and identified the Protein Activator of Interferon-Induced Protein Kinase (PACT) as a novel pro-viral factor for DENV. PACT is a double-stranded RNA-binding protein generally known to activate antiviral responses in virus-infected cells and block viral replication. However, in our studies, we observed that PACT plays a pro-viral role in DENV infection and specifically promotes viral RNA replication. Knockout of PACT resulted in a significant decrease in DENV RNA and protein abundances in infected cells, which was rescued upon ectopic expression of full-length PACT. An analysis of global gene expression changes indicated that several ER-associated pro-viral genes such as ERN1, DDIT3, HERPUD1, and EIF2AK3 are not upregulated in DENV-infected PACT knockout cells as compared to infected wildtype cells. Thus, our study demonstrates a novel role for PACT in promoting DENV replication, possibly through modulating the expression of ER-associated pro-viral genes.

JF  - Innate Immunity
VL  - 30
SP  - 40
EP  - 54
AB  - Interferon Stimulated Gene (ISG) expression plays a key role in the control of viral replication and development of a robust adaptive response. Understanding this dynamic relationship between the pathogen and host is critical to our understanding of viral life-cycles and development of potential novel anti-viral strategies. Traditionally, plasmid based exogenous prompter driven expression of ISGs has been used to investigate anti-viral ISG function, however there are deficiencies in this approach. To overcome this, we investigated the utility of CRISPR activation (CRISPRa), which allows for targeted transcriptional activation of a gene from its endogenous promoter. Using the CRISPRa-SAM system to induce targeted expression of a panel of anti-viral ISGs we showed robust induction of mRNA and protein expression. We then employed our CRISPRa-SAM ISG panel in several antiviral screen formats to test for the ability of ISGs to prevent viral induced cytopathic cell death (CPE) and replication of Dengue Virus (DENV), Zika Virus (ZIKV), West Nile Virus Kunjin (WNVKUN), Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) and Human Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Our CRISPRa approach confirmed the anti-viral activity of ISGs like IFI6, IFNβ and IFNλ2 that prevented viral induced CPE, which was supported by high-content immunofluorescence imaging analysis. This work highlights CRISPRa as a rapid, agile, and powerful methodology to identify and characterise ISGs and viral restriction factors.

EP  - 61;discussion161-3,251-3
AB  - The dengue virus multidomain RNA polymerase NS5 has been observed in the nucleus in mammalian infected cell systems. We previously showed that NS5 nuclear localization is mediated by two nuclear targeting signals within the NS5 interdomain region that are recognized by distinct members of the importin superfamily of intracellular transporters. Intriguingly, we have recently found that NS5 also possesses the ability to be exported from the nucleus by the importin family member CRM1 (exportin 1) both in Vero cells transfected to express NS5, and in dengue virus type 2 infected Vero cells, based on use of the CRM1-specific inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB). LMB treatment of Vero cells resulted in increased nuclear accumulation in both systems, and interestingly in the latter, resulted in an alteration in the kinetics of virus production. Our results imply that subcellular trafficking of NS5 at particular times in the infectious cycle may be central to the kinetics of virus production; perturbing this trafficking may represent a viable approach to develop new antiviral therapeutics.

EP  - 15597
AB  - Although all established functions of dengue virus NS5 (nonstructural protein 5) occur in the cytoplasm, its nuclear localization, mediated by dual nuclear localization sequences, is essential for virus replication. Here, we have determined the mechanism by which NS5 can localize in the cytoplasm to perform its role in replication, establishing for the first time that it is able to be exported from the nucleus by the exportin CRM1 and hence can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. We define the nuclear export sequence responsible to be residues 327–343 and confirm interaction of NS5 and CRM1 by pulldown assay. Significantly, greater nuclear accumulation of NS5 during infection due to CRM1 inhibition coincided with altered kinetics of virus production and decreased induction of the antiviral chemokine interleukin-8. This is the first report of a nuclear export sequence within NS5 for any member of the Flavivirus genus; because of its high conservation within the genus, it may represent a target for the treatment of diseases caused by several medically important flaviviruses.

AB  - Abstract Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) is a critical component of cell-intrinsic innate immunity that regulates both constitutive and induced antiviral defenses. Due to its short half-life, IRF1 function is generally considered to be regulated by its synthesis. However, how IRF1 activity is controlled post-translationally has remained poorly characterized. Here, we employed a proteomics approach to identify proteins interacting with IRF1, and found that CSNK2B, a regulatory subunit of casein kinase 2, interacts directly with IRF1 and constitutively modulates its transcriptional activity. Genome-wide CUT&RUN analysis of IRF1 binding loci revealed that CSNK2B acts generally to enhance the binding of IRF1 to chromatin, thereby enhancing transcription of key antiviral genes, such as PLAAT4 (also known as RARRES3/RIG1/TIG3). On the other hand, depleting CSNK2B triggered abnormal accumulation of IRF1 at AFAP1 loci, thereby down-regulating transcription of AFAP1, revealing contrary effects of CSNK2B on IRF1 binding at different loci. AFAP1 encodes an actin crosslinking factor that mediates Src activation. Importantly, CSNK2B was also found to mediate phosphorylation-dependent activation of AFAP1-Src signaling and exert suppressive effects against flaviviruses, including dengue virus. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated mode of IRF1 regulation and identify important effector genes mediating multiple cellular functions governed by CSNK2B and IRF1.

JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - Flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are enveloped, positivesense single-stranded RNA viruses. Upon entry into a host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, the virus particle undergoes low-pH–driven endosomal membrane fusion to release its genome into the cytoplasm [1]. This viral genome is then translated into a single polyprotein that is coand post-translationally processed into 3 structural and 7 nonstructural proteins. The 3 structural proteins that form the immature virus particle are the Capsid (C), Envelope (E), and precursor Membrane (prM) proteins. After formation of the core, consisting of the C protein complexed with the newly synthesized viral RNA genome, the core then buds into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane decorated with membrane-anchored viral E and prM proteins, forming an immature virus (Fig 1A). The immature virion then undergoes maturation during transport through the secretory pathway (Fig 1B). This involves large conformational rearrangements of the E proteins (Fig 2A), which enhances the cleavage of the prM to M protein by furin proteases (Fig 1C) to generate the infectious mature virus particle (Fig 1D).

JF  - Communications Biology
VL  - 3
AB  - Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are vectors of the RNA viruses chikungunya (CHIKV) and dengue that currently have no specific therapeutic treatments. The development of new methods to generate virus-refractory mosquitoes would be beneficial. Cas13b is an enzyme that uses RNA guides to target and cleave RNA molecules and has been reported to suppress RNA viruses in mammalian and plant cells. We investigated the potential use of the Prevotella sp. P5-125 Cas13b system to provide viral refractoriness in mosquito cells, using a virus-derived reporter and a CHIKV split replication system. Cas13b in combination with suitable guide RNAs could induce strong suppression of virus-derived reporter RNAs in insect cells. Surprisingly, the RNA guides alone (without Cas13b) also gave substantial suppression. Our study provides support for the potential use of Cas13b in mosquitoes, but also caution in interpreting CRISPR/Cas data as we show that guide RNAs can have Cas-independent effects. Priscilla Y. L. Tng et al. report a Cas13b-dependent way to suppress the transmissibility of RNA viruses chikungunya and dengue in mosquitoes. They use a virus-derived reporter and a CHIKV split replication system and demonstrate that Cas13b and gRNAs can inhibit virus-derived reporter RNAs in insect cells in vitro.

TI  - Catalase protects Aedes aegypti from oxidative stress and increases midgut infection prevalence of Dengue but not Zika
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 11
AB  - Background Digestion of blood in the midgut of Aedes aegypti results in the release of pro-oxidant molecules that can be toxic to the mosquito. We hypothesized that after a blood meal, the antioxidant capacity of the midgut is increased to protect cells against oxidative stress. Concomitantly, pathogens present in the blood ingested by mosquitoes, such as the arboviruses Dengue and Zika, also have to overcome the same oxidative challenge, and the antioxidant program induced by the insect is likely to influence infection status of the mosquito and its vectorial competence. Methodology/Principal findings We found that blood-induced catalase mRNA and activity in the midgut peaked 24 h after feeding and returned to basal levels after the completion of digestion. RNAi-mediated silencing of catalase (AAEL013407-RB) reduced enzyme activity in the midgut epithelia, increased H2O2 leakage and decreased fecundity and lifespan when mosquitoes were fed H2O2. When infected with Dengue 4 and Zika virus, catalase-silenced mosquitoes showed no alteration in infection intensity (number of plaque forming units/midgut) 7 days after the infectious meal. However, catalase knockdown reduced Dengue 4, but not Zika, infection prevalence (percent of infected midguts). Conclusion/Significance Here, we showed that blood ingestion triggers an antioxidant response in the midgut through the induction of catalase. This protection facilitates the establishment of Dengue virus in the midgut. Importantly, this mechanism appears to be specific for Dengue because catalase silencing did not change Zika virus prevalence. In summary, our data suggest that redox balance in the midgut modulates mosquito vectorial competence to arboviral infections.

AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are important human pathogens that represent global threats to human health. The genomes of these positive-strand RNA viruses have been shown to be substrates of both viral and cellular methyltransferases. N7-methylation of the 5′ cap structure is essential for infection whereas 2′-O-methylation of the penultimate nucleotide is required for evasion of host innate immunity. N6-methylation of internal adenosine nucleotides has also been shown to impact flavivirus infection. Here, I summarize recent progress made in understanding roles for methylation in the flavivirus life-cycle and discuss relevant emerging hypotheses.

TI  - Caveolae-mediated albumin transcytosis is enhanced in dengue-infected human endothelial cells: A model of vascular leakage in dengue hemorrhagic fever
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 6
AB  - Vascular leakage is a life-threatening complication of dengue virus (DENV) infection. Previously, association between “paracellular” endothelial hyperpermeability and plasma leakage had been extensively investigated. However, whether “transcellular” endothelial leakage is involved in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) remained unknown. We thus investigated effects of DENV (serotype 2) infection on transcellular transport of albumin, the main oncotic plasma protein, through human endothelial cell monolayer by Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, fluorescence imaging and fluorometry. The data showed that Alexa488-conjugated bovine serum albumin (Alexa488-BSA) was detectable inside DENV2-infected cells and its level was progressively increased during 48-h post-infection. While paracellular transport could be excluded using FITC-conjugated dextran, Alexa488-BSA was progressively increased and decreased in lower and upper chambers of Transwell, respectively. Pretreatment with nystatin, an inhibitor of caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway, significantly decreased albumin internalization into the DENV2-infected cells, whereas inhibitors of other endocytic pathways showed no significant effects. Co-localization of the internalized Alexa488-BSA and caveolin-1 was also observed. Our findings indicate that DENV infection enhances caveolae-mediated albumin transcytosis through human endothelial cells that may ultimately induce plasma leakage from intravascular compartment. Further elucidation of this model in vivo may lead to effective prevention and better therapeutic outcome of DHF/DSS.

TI  - Caveolin-1 in Lipid Rafts Interacts with Dengue Virus NS3 during Polyprotein Processing and Replication in HMEC-1 Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - Lipid rafts are ordered microdomains within cellular membranes that are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Caveolin (Cav-1) and flotillin (Flt-1) are markers of lipid rafts, which serve as an organizing center for biological phenomena and cellular signaling. Lipid rafts involvement in dengue virus (DENV) processing, replication, and assembly remains poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the role of lipid rafts after DENV endocytosis in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). The non-structural viral proteins NS3 and NS2B, but not NS5, were associated with detergent-resistant membranes. In sucrose gradients, both NS3 and NS2B proteins appeared in Cav-1 and Flt-1 rich fractions. Additionally, double immunofluorescence staining of DENV-infected HMEC-1 cells showed that NS3 and NS2B, but not NS5, colocalized with Cav-1 and Flt-1. Furthermore, in HMEC-1cells transfected with NS3 protease, shown a strong overlap between NS3 and Cav-1, similar to that in DENV-infected cells. In contrast, double-stranded viral RNA (dsRNA) overlapped weakly with Cav-1 and Flt-1. Given these results, we investigated whether Cav-1 directly interacted with NS3. Cav-1 and NS3 co-immunoprecipitated, indicating that they resided within the same complex. Furthermore, when cellular cholesterol was depleted by methyl-beta cyclodextrin treatment after DENV entrance, lipid rafts were disrupted, NS3 protein level was reduced, besides Cav-1 and NS3 were displaced to fractions 9 and 10 in sucrose gradient analysis, and we observed a dramatically reduction of DENV particles release. These data demonstrate the essential role of caveolar cholesterol-rich lipid raft microdomains in DENV polyprotein processing and replication during the late stages of the DENV life cycle.

TI  - Cell Biology of Virus Infection. The Role of Cytoskeletal Dynamics Integrity in the Effectiveness of Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - The cell biology of viral infections is the focus of this research, in which the role of the cytoskeleton in dengue virus (DENV) replication in cell cultures was evaluated by means of Nocodazole and Cytochalasin D treatments before and after of DENV infection. The potential contribution of cytoskeleton elements with/without the treatment of depolymerizing agents was evidenced and quantified by the subcellular distribution of viral proteins, virions produced, and viral protein quantification. The cytoskeleton is involved in DENV replication because treatments with actin microfi‐ laments and microtubule depolymerizing agents in non-cytotoxic concentrations, affected DENV2 replication in Vero cells and decreased both the viral protein expression and infectious virion production, when compared with non-treated cells. The actin and microtubules are partly involved in DENV2 replication, since the treatment does not completely blocked viral replication, suggesting that these components are necessary but not sufficient alone for DENV2 replication in Vero cells. The structural and functional role of actin and the microtubules in replication are postulated here, opening new perspectives for understanding the architecture of the replicative complex and viral morphogenesis processes, due to the role of the cytoskeleton in the organization, recruitment, and function of the cellular elements necessary for the assembly of viral factories.

TI  - Cell Type Variability in the Incorporation of Lipids in the Dengue Virus Virion
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - A lipid bilayer produced from the host membrane makes up around 20% of the weight of the dengue virus (DENV) virion and is crucial for virus entry. Despite its significance, the virion’s lipid composition is still poorly understood. In tandem with lipid profiles of the cells utilised to generate the virions, this work determined a partial lipid profile of DENV virions derived from two cell lines (C6/36 and LLC-MK2). The results showed distinctive profiles between the two cell types. In the mammalian LLC-MK2 cells, 30.8% (73/237 identified lipid species; 31 upregulated, 42 downregulated) of lipid species were altered in response to infection, whilst in insect C6/36 cells only 12.0% (25/208; 19 upregulated, 6 downregulated) of lipid species showed alterations in response to infection. For virions from LLC-MK2 cells, 14 lipids were detected specifically in virions with a further seven lipids being enriched (over mock controls). For virions from C6/36 cells, 43 lipids were detected that were not seen in mock preparations, with a further 16 being specifically enriched (over mock control). These results provide the first lipid description of DENV virions produced in mammalian and mosquito cells, as well as the lipid changes in the corresponding infected cells.

Peoples are well aware now on how to control dengue viral infection. Its first epidemic attack claims the lives of more than 300 peoples and more than 15000 persons were infected with viral infection in one year. In spite of taking national and international control measures, the threat of this breakout still exists. Since 2011, its molecular and cellular pathology was ignored in academic levels and it can be considered that by understanding the exact cellular and molecular pathology of dengue viral infection, this threat can be reduced to the lowest level.

TI  - Cell-Fusing Agent Virus Reduces Arbovirus Dissemination in Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes In Vivo
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti carries several arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that are pathogenic to humans, including dengue and Zika viruses. Interestingly, A. aegypti is also naturally infected with insect-only viruses, such as cell-fusing agent virus. Although interactions between cell-fusing agent virus and dengue virus have been documented in mosquito cells in culture, whether wild strains of cell-fusing agent virus interfere with arbovirus transmission by live mosquitoes was unknown. We used an experimental approach to demonstrate that cell-fusing agent virus infection reduces the propagation of dengue and Zika viruses in A. aegypti mosquitoes. These results support the idea that insect-only viruses in nature can modulate the ability of mosquitoes to carry arboviruses of medical significance and that they could possibly be manipulated to reduce arbovirus transmission. ABSTRACT Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the main vectors of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of public health significance, such as the flaviviruses dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Mosquitoes are also the natural hosts of a wide range of viruses that are insect specific, raising the question of their influence on arbovirus transmission in nature. Cell-fusing agent virus (CFAV) was the first described insect-specific flavivirus, initially discovered in an A. aegypti cell line and subsequently detected in natural A. aegypti populations. It was recently shown that DENV and the CFAV strain isolated from the A. aegypti cell line have mutually beneficial interactions in mosquito cells in culture. However, whether natural strains of CFAV and DENV interact in live mosquitoes is unknown. Using a wild-type CFAV isolate recently derived from Thai A. aegypti mosquitoes, we found that CFAV negatively interferes with both DENV type 1 and ZIKV in vitro and in vivo. For both arboviruses, prior infection by CFAV reduced the dissemination titer in mosquito head tissues. Our results indicate that the interactions observed between arboviruses and the CFAV strain derived from the cell line might not be a relevant model of the viral interference that we observed in vivo. Overall, our study supports the hypothesis that insect-specific flaviviruses may contribute to reduce the transmission of human-pathogenic flaviviruses.

TI  - Cell-to-Cell Spread of Dengue Viral RNA in Mosquito Cells
JF  - BioMed Research International
VL  - 2020
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is an important mosquito-borne arbovirus that is particularly prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. The virus is generally ingested with a blood meal, replicates in host tissues, and disseminates into salivary glands for transmission to the next host. Membrane-bound vacuoles carrying DENV particles have been documented in mosquito cells and play a role in the cell-to-cell transmission of DENV2. C189 is one member of the tetraspanin family and generally increases its expression as one component of the vacuoles (C189-VCs) within C6/36 cells infected with DENV2. In the present study, we have further demonstrated via sucrose gradient centrifugation as well as magnetic immune isolation (MI) that the RNA of DENV2 was eventually carried by C189-VCs. In addition, viral RNA was shown to spread from donor to recipient cells in a coculture assay even when 20 mM NH4Cl was added to inhibit virus replication in the culture. In an alternate assay using the transwell system, viral RNA was only detected in recipient cells in the absence of 40 mM NH4Cl, suggesting that cell-cell contact is required for the intercellular spread of DENV2. In turn, the formation of viral synapse (VS) derived from aggregates of viral particles was frequently observed at sites of cell contact. Taken together, the formation of C189-VCs in C6/36 cells is induced by DENV2 infection, which may serve as a vehicle for transferring virions and also viral RNA to neighboring cells by cell-to-cell transmission after cell-cell contact. This finding provides insight into the understanding of viral spread between mosquito cells. It may also elucidate the benign persistent infection in mosquito cells and efficient dissemination of DENV infection within a mosquito vector.

TI  - Cellular Control of Dengue Virus Replication: Role of Interferon-Inducible Genes
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - Dengue, one of the most common mosquito‐borne viral infectious diseases in the world, is caused by the dengue virus (DENV). This enveloped RNA virus has immunologi‐ cally distinct serotypes that increase the risk of life‐threatening diseases, such as den‐ gue haemorrhagic fever. However, no effective antiviral therapy against DENV infection has yet been established. As seen in other RNA viruses, various cellular factors have been reported to participate in efficient DENV replication. On the other hand, increas‐ ing recent evidence demonstrates that host cells harbour inhibitory factors that limit the DENV replication. In particular, it is well known that the response of interferons (IFNs), the first line of a host defence system against invading pathogens, evokes the expression of a number of genes that negatively regulate various steps of virus replication. This set of inhibitory genes, called interferon‐stimulated genes (ISGs), is considered to be a central force in IFN‐mediated antiviral responses. In this chapter, we focus our attention on the cellular factors involved in DENV infection, particularly to those that modulate DENV replication through their association with viral RNA. In addition, we also sum‐ marize general experimental approaches for identifying the host factors of RNA viruses, including DENV.

TI  - Cellular Oxidative Stress Response Controls the Antiviral and Apoptotic Programs in Dengue Virus-Infected Dendritic Cells
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a re-emerging arthropod borne flavivirus that infects more than 300 million people worldwide, leading to 50,000 deaths annually. Because dendritic cells (DC) in the skin and blood are the first target cells for DENV, we sought to investigate the early molecular events involved in the host response to the virus in primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC). Using a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of DENV2-infected human Mo-DC, three major responses were identified within hours of infection - the activation of IRF3/7/STAT1 and NF-κB-driven antiviral and inflammatory networks, as well as the stimulation of an oxidative stress response that included the stimulation of an Nrf2-dependent antioxidant gene transcriptional program. DENV2 infection resulted in the intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was dependent on NADPH-oxidase (NOX). A decrease in ROS levels through chemical or genetic inhibition of the NOX-complex dampened the innate immune responses to DENV infection and facilitated DENV replication; ROS were also essential in driving mitochondrial apoptosis in infected Mo-DC. In addition to stimulating innate immune responses to DENV, increased ROS led to the activation of bystander Mo-DC which up-regulated maturation/activation markers and were less susceptible to viral replication. We have identified a critical role for the transcription factor Nrf2 in limiting both antiviral and cell death responses to the virus by feedback modulation of oxidative stress. Silencing of Nrf2 by RNA interference increased DENV-associated immune and apoptotic responses. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the level of oxidative stress is critical to the control of both antiviral and apoptotic programs in DENV-infected human Mo-DC and highlight the importance of redox homeostasis in the outcome of DENV infection.

TI  - Cellular Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein Is an Important Dengue Virus Restriction Factor
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 10
AB  - The intrinsic antiviral defense is based on cellular restriction factors that are constitutively expressed and, thus, active even before a pathogen enters the cell. The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) are discrete nuclear foci that contain several cellular proteins involved in intrinsic antiviral responses against a number of viruses. Accumulating reports have shown the importance of PML as a DNA virus restriction factor and how these pathogens evade this antiviral activity. However, very little information is available regarding the antiviral role of PML against RNA viruses. Dengue virus (DENV) is an RNA emerging mosquito-borne human pathogen affecting millions of individuals each year by causing severe and potentially fatal syndromes. Since no licensed antiviral drug against DENV infection is currently available, it is of great importance to understand the factors mediating intrinsic immunity that may lead to the development of new pharmacological agents that can boost their potency and thereby lead to treatments for this viral disease. In the present study, we investigated the in vitro antiviral role of PML in DENV-2 A549 infected cells.

TI  - Cellular Proteins from Human Monocytes Bind to Dengue 4 Virus Minus-Strand 3′ Untranslated Region RNA
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 77
SP  - 3067
EP  - 3076
AB  - ABSTRACT The synthesis of plus and minus RNA strands of several RNA viruses requires as a first step the interaction of some viral regulatory sequences with cellular and viral proteins. The dengue 4 virus genome, a single-stranded, positive-polarity RNA, is flanked by two untranslated regions (UTR) located in the 5′ and 3′ ends. The 3′UTR in the minus-strand RNA [3′UTR (−)] has been thought to function as a promoter for the synthesis of plus-strand RNA. To study the initial interaction between this 3′UTR and cellular and viral proteins, mobility shift assays were performed, and four ribonucleoprotein complexes (I through IV) were formed when uninfected and infected U937 cells (human monocyte cell line) interacted with the 3′UTR (−) of dengue 4 virus. Cross-linking assays with RNAs containing the complete 3′UTR (−) (nucleotides [nt] 101 to 1) or a partial sequence from nt 101 to 45 and nt 44 to 1 resulted in specific binding of some cellular proteins. Supermobility shift and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the La protein forms part of these complexes. To determine the region in the 3′ UTR that interacted with the La protein, two deletion mutants were generated. The mutant (del-96), with a deletion of nt 96 to 101, was unable to interact with the La protein, suggesting that La interacted with the 5′ portion of the 3′UTR (−). Complex I, which was the main ribonucleoprotein complex formed with the 3′UTR (−) and which had the fastest electrophoretic migration, contained proteins such as calreticulin and protein disulfide isomerase, which constitute important components of the endoplasmic reticulum.

TI  - Cellular Vimentin Regulates Construction of Dengue Virus Replication Complexes through Interaction with NS4A Protein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 1897
EP  - 1913
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) interacts with host cellular factors to construct a more favorable environment for replication, and the interplay between DENV and the host cellular cytoskeleton may represent one of the potential antiviral targeting sites. However, the involvement of cellular vimentin intermediate filaments in DENV replication has been explored less. Here, we revealed the direct interaction between host cellular vimentin and DENV nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A), a known component of the viral replication complex (RC), during DENV infection using tandem affinity purification, coimmunoprecipitation, and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, the dynamics of vimentin-NS4A interaction were demonstrated by using confocal three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and proximity ligation assay. Most importantly, we report for the first time the discovery of the specific region of NS4A that interacts with vimentin lies within the first 50 amino acid residues at the cytosolic N-terminal domain of NS4A (N50 region). Besides identifying vimentin-NS4A interaction, vimentin reorganization and phosphorylation by calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II occurs during DENV infection, signifying that vimentin reorganization is important in maintaining and supporting the DENV RCs. Interestingly, we found that gene silencing of vimentin by small interfering RNA induced a significant alteration in the distribution of RCs in DENV-infected cells. This finding further supports the crucial role of intact vimentin scaffold in localizing and concentrating DENV RCs at the perinuclear site, thus facilitating efficient viral RNA replication. Collectively, our findings implicate the biological and functional significance of vimentin during DENV replication, as we propose that the association of DENV RCs with vimentin is mediated by DENV NS4A.

TI  - Cellular and Cytokine Correlates of Severe Dengue Infection
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Background The occurrence of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is thought to result from a complex interplay between the virus, host genetics and host immune factors. Existing published data are not consistent, in part related to relatively small sample sizes. We set out to determine possible associations between dengue virus (DEN-V) NS3 specific T cells and cytokine and chemokine levels and the pathogenesis of severe disease in a large cohort of individuals with DHF. Methodology/Principal Findings By using ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot assays we determined DENV-NS3 specific responses in patients with varying severity of DHF. Other cytokines produced by DENV-NS3 specific T cells were determined by using multiple bead array analysis (MBAA). We also determined the serum cytokine levels using MBAA, lymphocyte subsets and Annexin V expression of lymphocytes in patients with varying severity of DHF. Of the 112 DHF patients studied, 29 developed shock. Serum IL-10 and IP-10 levels positively and significantly correlated with T cell apoptosis while IL-10 levels inversely correlated with T cell numbers. In contrast, TGFß showed a very significant (P<0.0001) and positive correlation (Spearman’s R = 0.65) with the platelet counts, consistent with platelet release. We found that whilst patients with severe dengue had lower total T cell numbers, the DV-NS3 specific T cells persisted and produced high levels of IFNγ but not TNFα, IL-3, IL-13, IL-2, IL-10 or IL-17. Conclusions/Significance Our data suggest that serum IL-10, TNFα and TGFβ differentially associate with dengue disease severity.

TI  - Characterization of Dendritic Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles During Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 9
AB  - The dengue virus (DENV), transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes, is one of the most important arboviral infections in the world. Dengue begins as a febrile condition, and in certain patients, it can evolve severe clinical outcomes, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The reasons why certain patients develop DHF or DSS have not been thoroughly elucidated to date, and both patient and viral factors have been implicated. Previous work has shown that a severe immune dysfunction involving dendritic cells and T cells plays a key role in increasing the disease severity, especially in secondary heterologous infections. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous particles that are secreted by several cell types involved in homeostatic and pathological processes. Secretion of EVs by infected cells can enhance immune responses or favor viral evasion. In this study, we compare the molecular content of EVs that are secreted by human primary dendritic cells under different conditions: uninfected or infected with DENV3 strains isolated from patients with different infection phenotypes (a severe case involving DSS and a mild case). Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDCs) were infected with the dengue virus strains DENV3 5532 (severe) or DENV3 290 (mild), and the EVs were isolated. The presence of cup-shaped EVs was confirmed by electron microscopy and immunostaining with CD9, CD81, and CD83. The RNA content from the mdDC-infected cells contained several mRNAs and miRNAs related to immune responses compared to the EVs from mock-infected mdDCs. A number of these RNAs were detected exclusively during infection with DENV3 290 or DENV3 5532. This result suggests that the differential immune modulation of mdDCs by dengue strains can be achieved through the EV pathway. Additionally, we observed an association of EVs with DENV-infectious particles that seem to be protected from antibodies targeting the DENV envelope protein. We also showed that EVs derived from cells treated with IFN alpha have a protective effect against DENV infection in other cells. These results suggested that during DENV infection, the EV pathway could be exploited to favor viral viability, although immune mechanisms to counteract viral infection can also involve DC-derived EVs.

AB  - Dengue viruses have been shown to infect a wide variety of cell lines with different consequences. In this study, cellular responses to dengue virus type 2 New Guinea C strain (D2NGC) viral infection in mosquito gut (C6/36), African green monkey kidney (Vero) and human lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells were investigated. Microscopic and immunostaining studies of infected cells showed different patterns of infection in each cell lines reflecting the different degrees of permissiveness to D2NGC infection. Using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining method, we showed that D2NGC virus induced apoptosis in the three cell lines studied. However, the levels of apoptotic cells in each cell lines varied suggesting that programmed cell death is dependent on the unique properties of each cell lines. Results obtained from this study imply that diverse mechanisms are employed in D2NGC infection in different cells. This information will contribute towards further understanding of the mechanisms of DEN virus infection.

TI  - Characterization of Dengue Virus NS4A and NS4B Protein Interaction
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 3455
EP  - 3470
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus replication is mediated by a membrane-associated replication complex where viral membrane proteins NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B serve as the scaffold for the replication complex formation. Here, we used dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) as a model to characterize viral NS4A-NS4B interaction. NS4A interacts with NS4B in virus-infected cells and in cells transiently expressing NS4A and NS4B in the absence of other viral proteins. Recombinant NS4A and NS4B proteins directly bind to each other with an estimated Kd (dissociation constant) of 50 nM. Amino acids 40 to 76 (spanning the first transmembrane domain, consisting of amino acids 50 to 73) of NS4A and amino acids 84 to 146 (also spanning the first transmembrane domain, consisting of amino acids 101 to 129) of NS4B are the determinants for NS4A-NS4B interaction. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis suggests that NS4A residues 17 to 80 form two amphipathic helices (helix α1, comprised of residues 17 to 32, and helix α2, comprised of residues 40 to 47) that associate with the cytosolic side of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and helix α3 (residues 52 to 75) that transverses the ER membrane. In addition, NMR analysis identified NS4A residues that may participate in the NS4A-NS4B interaction. Amino acid substitution of these NS4A residues exhibited distinct effects on viral replication. Three of the four NS4A mutations (L48A, T54A, and L60A) that affected the NS4A-NS4B interaction abolished or severely reduced viral replication; in contrast, two NS4A mutations (F71A and G75A) that did not affect NS4A-NS4B interaction had marginal effects on viral replication, demonstrating the biological relevance of the NS4A-NS4B interaction to DENV-2 replication. Taken together, the study has provided experimental evidence to argue that blocking the NS4A-NS4B interaction could be a potential antiviral approach. IMPORTANCE Flavivirus NS4A and NS4B proteins are essential components of the ER membrane-associated replication complex. The current study systematically characterizes the interaction between flavivirus NS4A and NS4B. Using DENV-2 as a model, we show that NS4A interacts with NS4B in virus-infected cells, in cells transiently expressing NS4A and NS4B proteins, or in vitro with recombinant NS4A and NS4B proteins. We mapped the minimal regions required for the NS4A-NS4B interaction to be amino acids 40 to 76 of NS4A and amino acids 84 to 146 of NS4B. NMR analysis revealed the secondary structure of amino acids 17 to 80 of NS4A and the NS4A amino acids that may participate in the NS4A-NS4B interaction. Functional analysis showed a correlation between viral replication and NS4A-NS4B interaction, demonstrating the biological importance of the NS4A-NS4B interaction. The study has advanced our knowledge of the molecular function of flavivirus NS4A and NS4B proteins. The results also suggest that inhibitors of the NS4A-NS4B interaction could be pursued for flavivirus antiviral development.

TI  - Characterization of Magnitude and Antigen Specificity of HLA-DP, DQ, and DRB3/4/5 Restricted DENV-Specific CD4+ T Cell Responses
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 10
AB  - Background: Dengue Virus (DENV) associated disease is a major public health problem. Assessment of HLA class II restricted DENV-specific responses is relevant for immunopathology and definition of correlates of protection. While previous studies characterized responses restricted by the HLA-DRB1 locus, the responses associated with other class II loci have not been characterized to date. Accordingly, we mapped HLA-DP, DQ, and DRB3/4/5 restricted DENV-specific CD4 T cell epitopes in PBMCs derived from the DENV endemic region Sri Lanka. Methods: We studied 12 DP, DQ, and DRB3/4/5 alleles that are commonly expressed and provide worldwide coverage >82% for each of the loci analyzed and >99% when combined. CD4+ T cells purified by negative selection were stimulated with pools of HLA-predicted binders for 2 weeks with autologous APC. Epitope reactive T cells were enumerated using IFNγ ELISPOT assay. This strategy was previously applied to identify DRB1 restricted epitopes. In parallel, membrane expression levels of HLA-DR, DP, and DQ proteins was assessed using flow cytometry. Results: Epitopes were identified for all DP, DQ, and DRB3/4/5 allelic variants albeit with magnitudes significantly lower than the ones previously observed for the DRB1 locus. This was in line with lower membrane expression of HLA-DP and DQ molecules on the PBMCs tested, as compared to HLA-DR. Significant differences between loci were observed in antigen immunodominance. Capsid responses were dominant for DRB1/3/4/5 and DP alleles but negligible for the DQ alleles. NS3 responses were dominant in the case of DRB1/3/4/5 and DQ but absent in the case of DP. NS1 responses were prominent in the case of the DP alleles, but negligible in the case of DR and DQ. In terms of epitope specificity, repertoire was largely overlapping between DRB1 and DRB3/4/5, while DP and DQ loci recognized largely distinct epitope sets. Conclusion: The HLA-DP, DQ, and DRB3/4/5 loci mediate DENV-CD4 specific immune responses of lower magnitude as compared to HLA-DRB1, consistent with their lower levels of expression. The responses are associated with distinct and characteristic patterns of immunodominance, and variable epitope overlap across loci.

TI  - Characterization of N-Glycan Structures on the Surface of Mature Dengue 2 Virus Derived from Insect Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 10
AB  - DENV envelope glycoprotein (E) is responsible for interacting with host cell receptors and is the main target for the development of a dengue vaccine based on an induction of neutralizing antibodies. It is well known that DENV E glycoprotein has two potential N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn67 and Asn153. The N-glycans of E glycoprotein have been shown to influence the proper folding of the protein, its cellular localization, its interactions with receptors and its immunogenicity. However, the precise structures of the N-glycans that are attached to E glycoprotein remain elusive, although the crystal structure of DENV E has been determined. This study characterized the structures of envelope protein N-linked glycans on mature DENV-2 particles derived from insect cells via an integrated method that used both lectin microarray and MALDI-TOF-MS. By combining these methods, a high heterogeneity of DENV N-glycans was found. Five types of N-glycan were identified on DENV-2, including mannose, GalNAc, GlcNAc, fucose and sialic acid; high mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharides and the galactosylation of N-glycans were the major structures that were found. Furthermore, a complex between a glycan on DENV and the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of DC-SIGN was mimicked with computational docking experiments. For the first time, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the N-linked glycan profile of whole DENV-2 particles derived from insect cells.

TI  - Characterization of RyDEN (C19orf66) as an Interferon-Stimulated Cellular Inhibitor against Dengue Virus Replication
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most important arthropod-borne pathogens that cause life-threatening diseases in humans. However, no vaccine or specific antiviral is available for dengue. As seen in other RNA viruses, the innate immune system plays a key role in controlling DENV infection and disease outcome. Although the interferon (IFN) response, which is central to host protective immunity, has been reported to limit DENV replication, the molecular details of how DENV infection is modulated by IFN treatment are elusive. In this study, by employing a gain-of-function screen using a type I IFN-treated cell-derived cDNA library, we identified a previously uncharacterized gene, C19orf66, as an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) that inhibits DENV replication, which we named Repressor of yield of DENV (RyDEN). Overexpression and gene knockdown experiments revealed that expression of RyDEN confers resistance to all serotypes of DENV in human cells. RyDEN expression also limited the replication of hepatitis C virus, Kunjin virus, Chikungunya virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and human adenovirus. Importantly, RyDEN was considered to be a crucial effector molecule in the IFN-mediated anti-DENV response. When affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis was performed, RyDEN was revealed to form a complex with cellular mRNA-binding proteins, poly(A)-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), and La motif-related protein 1 (LARP1). Interestingly, PABPC1 and LARP1 were found to be positive modulators of DENV replication. Since RyDEN influenced intracellular events on DENV replication and, suppression of protein synthesis from DENV-based reporter construct RNA was also observed in RyDEN-expressing cells, our data suggest that RyDEN is likely to interfere with the translation of DENV via interaction with viral RNA and cellular mRNA-binding proteins, resulting in the inhibition of virus replication in infected cells.

TI  - Characterization of Viral Interference in Aedes albopictus C6/36 Cells Persistently Infected with Dengue Virus 2
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - Arboviruses are an important group of pathogens that cause diseases of medical and veterinary concern worldwide. The interactions of these viruses with their host cells are complex, and frequently, the coexistence of two different viruses in the same cell results in the inhibition of replication in one of the viruses, which is a phenomenon called viral interference. This phenomenon can be exploited to develop antiviral strategies. Insect cell lines persistently infected with arboviruses are useful models with which to study viral interference. In this work, a model of C6/36-HT cells (from Aedes albopictus mosquitoes) persistently infected with Dengue virus, serotype 2, was used. Viral interference was evaluated via plaque and flow cytometry assays. The presence of heterotypic interference against the other serotypes of the same virus and homologous interference against yellow fever virus was determined; however, this cell line did not display heterologous viral interference against Sindbis virus. The mechanisms responsible for viral interference have not been fully elucidated, but small RNAs could be involved. However, the silencing of Ago3, a key protein in the genome-derived P-element-induced wimpy testis pathway, did not alter the viral interference process, suggesting that viral interference occurs independent of this pathway.

TI  - Characterization of dengue virus 3’UTR RNA binding proteins in mosquitoes reveals that AeStaufen reduces subgenomic flaviviral RNA in saliva
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 18
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) are expanding global pathogens that are transmitted through the bite of mosquitoes, mostly Aedes aegypti. As RNA viruses, DENV rely on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to complete their life cycle. Alternatively, RBPs can act as restriction factors that prevent DENV multiplication. While the importance of RBPs is well-supported in humans, there is a dearth of information about their influence on DENV transmission by mosquitoes. Such knowledge could be harnessed to design novel, effective interventions against DENV. Here, we successfully adapted RNA-affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry–a technique initially developed in mammalian cells–to identify RBPs in Ae. aegypti cells. We identified fourteen RBPs interacting with DENV serotype 2 3’UTR, which is involved in the viral multiplication and produces subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA). We validated the RNA affinity results for two RBPs by confirming that AePur binds the 3’UTR, whereas AeStaufen interacts with both 3’UTR and sfRNA. Using in vivo functional evaluation, we determined that RBPs like AeRan, AeExoRNase, and AeRNase have pro-viral functions, whereas AeGTPase, AeAtu, and AePur have anti-viral functions in mosquitoes. Furthermore, we showed that human and mosquito Pur homologs have a shared affinity to DENV2 RNA, although the anti-viral effect is specific to the mosquito protein. Importantly, we revealed that AeStaufen mediates a reduction of gRNA and sfRNA copies in several mosquito tissues, including the salivary glands and that AeStaufen-mediated sfRNA reduction diminishes the concentration of transmission-enhancing sfRNA in saliva, thereby revealing AeStaufen’s role in DENV transmission. By characterizing the first RBPs that associate with DENV2 3’UTR in mosquitoes, our study unravels new pro- and anti-viral targets for the design of novel therapeutic interventions as well as provides foundation for studying the role of RBPs in virus-vector interactions.

AB  - Amino terminal sequences of the envelope protein E and the three largest nonstructural proteins NS1, NS3, and NS5 of the New Guinea C strain of dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2) were obtained by nucleotide and protein sequencing. Clones were prepared containing cDNA of DEN-2 virus in the plasmid pUC8. The nucleotide sequences of viral cDNA inserts were determined and the cDNA of each clone positioned on the flavivirus genomic map by comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with that of yellow fever virus. Radiolabelled E, NS1, NS3 and NS5 were purified by lectin affinity chromatography and preparative gel electrophoresis. Purified proteins were subsequently analysed by Edman degradation to establish the origins of the amino termini of these proteins in the deduced DEN-2 amino acid sequence. Thus the amino acid sequences surrounding the likely proteolytic cleavage sites used in the formation of these four proteins were determined. Of particular interest was the sequence containing the amino terminus of NS3, namely Lys-Lys-Gln-Arg-Ala-Gly where Ala is the first amino acid of NS3. Cleavage following one basic residue in the flavivirus polyprotein has not been reported previously.

EP  - 12028
AB  - ABSTRACT In this study, we investigated the cell entry characteristics of dengue virus (DENV) type 2 strain S1 on mosquito, BHK-15, and BS-C-1 cells. The concentration of virus particles measured by biochemical assays was found to be substantially higher than the number of infectious particles determined by infectivity assays, leading to an infectious unit-to-particle ratio of approximately 1:2,600 to 1:72,000, depending on the specific assays used. In order to explain this high ratio, we investigated the receptor binding and membrane fusion characteristics of single DENV particles in living cells using real-time fluorescence microscopy. For this purpose, DENV was labeled with the lipophilic fluorescent probe DiD (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt). The surface density of the DiD dye in the viral membrane was sufficiently high to largely quench the fluorescence intensity but still allowed clear detection of single virus particles. Fusion of the viral membrane with the cell membrane was evident as fluorescence dequenching. It was observed that DENV binds very inefficiently to the cells used, explaining at least in part the high infectious unit-to-particle ratio. The particles that did bind to the cells showed different types of transport behavior leading to membrane fusion in both the periphery and perinuclear regions of the cell. Membrane fusion was observed in 1 out of 6 bound virus particles, indicating that a substantial fraction of the virus has the capacity to fuse. DiD dequenching was completely inhibited by ammonium chloride, demonstrating that fusion occurs exclusively from within acidic endosomes.

JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - Background The envelope (E) of dengue virus (DENV) is the major target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccine development. After biosynthesis E protein forms a heterodimer with precursor membrane (prM) protein. Recent reports of infection enhancement by anti-prM monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suggest anti-prM responses could be potentially harmful. Previously, we studied a series of C-terminal truncation constructs expressing DENV type 4 prM/E or E proteins and found the ectodomain of E protein alone could be recognized by all 12 mAbs tested, suggesting E protein ectodomain as a potential subunit immunogen without inducing anti-prM response. The characteristics of DENV E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein remains largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we investigated the expression, membrane association, glycosylation pattern, secretion and particle formation of E protein ectodomain of DENV4 in the presence or absence of prM protein. E protein ectodomain associated with membrane in or beyond trans-Golgi and contained primarily complex glycans, whereas full-length E protein associated with ER membrane and contained high mannose glycans. In the absence of prM protein, E protein ectodomain can secrete as well as form particles of approximately 49 nm in diameter, as revealed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation with or without detergent and electron microscopy. Mutational analysis revealed that the secretion of E protein ectodomain was affected by N-linked glycosylation and could be restored by treatment with ammonia chloride. Conclusions/Significance Considering the enhancement of DENV infectivity by anti-prM antibodies, our findings provide new insights into the expression and secretion of E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein and contribute to future subunit vaccine design.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infects 50–100 million people worldwide per year, causing severe public health problems. DENV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, an attractive target for drug development, catalyzes de novo replication of the viral genome in three phases: initiation, transition, and elongation. The aim of this work was to characterize the mechanism of nucleotide addition catalyzed by the polymerase domain of DENV serotype 2 during elongation using transient kinetic methods. We measured the kinetics of formation of the elongation complex containing the polymerase and a double-stranded RNA by preincubation experiments. The elongation complex assembly is slow, following a one-step binding mechanism with an association rate of 0.0016 ± 0.0001 μm−1s−1 and a dissociation rate of 0.00020 ± 0.00005 s−1 at 37 °C. The elongation complex assembly is 6 times slower at 30 °C and requires Mg2+ during preincubation. The assembled elongation complex incorporates a correct nucleotide, GTP, to the primer with a Kd of 275 ± 52 μm and kpol of 18 ± 1 s−1. The fidelity of the polymerase is 1/34,000, 1/59,000, 1/135,000 for misincorporation of UTP, ATP, and CTP opposite CMP in the template, respectively. The fidelity of DENV polymerase is comparable with HIV reverse transcriptase and the poliovirus polymerase. This work reports the first description of presteady-state kinetics and fidelity for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the Flaviviridae family.

AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue viruses (DV) represent a significant global health burden, with up to 400 million infections every year and around 500,000 infected individuals developing life-threatening disease. In spite of attempts to develop vaccine candidates and antiviral drugs, there is a lack of approved therapeutics for the treatment of DV infection. We have previously reported the identification of ST-148, a small-molecule inhibitor exhibiting broad and potent antiviral activity against DV in vitro and in vivo (C. M. Byrd et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 57:15–25, 2013, doi:10 .1128/AAC.01429-12). In the present study, we investigated the mode of action of this promising compound by using a combination of biochemical, virological, and imaging-based techniques. We confirmed that ST-148 targets the capsid protein and obtained evidence of bimodal antiviral activity affecting both assembly/release and entry of infectious DV particles. Importantly, by using a robust bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based assay, we observed an ST-148-dependent increase of capsid self-interaction. These results were corroborated by molecular modeling studies that also revealed a plausible model for compound binding to capsid protein and inhibition by a distinct resistance mutation. These results suggest that ST-148-enhanced capsid protein self-interaction perturbs assembly and disassembly of DV nucleocapsids, probably by inducing structural rigidity. Thus, as previously reported for other enveloped viruses, stabilization of capsid protein structure is an attractive therapeutic concept that also is applicable to flaviviruses. IMPORTANCE Dengue viruses are arthropod-borne viruses representing a significant global health burden. They infect up to 400 million people and are endemic to subtropical and tropical areas of the world. Currently, there are neither vaccines nor approved therapeutics for the prophylaxis or treatment of DV infections, respectively. This study reports the characterization of the mode of action of ST-148, a small-molecule capsid inhibitor with potent antiviral activity against all DV serotypes. Our results demonstrate that ST-148 stabilizes capsid protein self-interaction, thereby likely perturbing assembly and disassembly of viral nucleocapsids by inducing structural rigidity. This, in turn, might interfere with the release of viral RNA from incoming nucleocapsids (uncoating) as well as assembly of progeny virus particles. As previously reported for other enveloped viruses, we propose the capsid as a novel tractable target for flavivirus inhibitors.

TI  - Characterization of the Temporal Dynamics of the Endothelial–Mesenchymal-like Transition Induced by Soluble Factors from Dengue Virus Infection in Microvascular Endothelial Cells
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 26
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) infection poses a severe life-threatening risk in certain cases. This is mainly due to endothelial dysregulation, which causes plasma leakage and hemorrhage. However, the etiology of DV-induced endothelial dysregulation remains incompletely understood. To identify the potential mechanisms of endothelial dysregulation caused by DV, the effects of conditioned media from Dengue virus (CMDV) on the mechanics and transcriptional profile of the endothelial cells were examined using permeability assays, atomic force microscopy, In-Cell Western blot and in silico transcriptomics. Exposure of HMEC-1 cells to the CMDV increased endothelial permeability and cellular stiffness. It also induced the expression of the key proteins associated with endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). These data support the notion that the DV promotes endothelial dysfunction by triggering transcriptional programs that compromise the endothelial barrier function. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying DV-induced endothelial dysregulation is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate the severe outcomes associated with dengue infection.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 88 Pt 8
SP  - 2214
EP  - 22
AB  - The first 84 nt in the 3' non-translated region (3' NTR) of dengue type 1 virus (DENV-1) exhibit lower levels of conservation than the other regions; this region is named the variable region (VR). The VR is further divided into two subregions: a 5'-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) and a 3'-terminal semi-variable region (SVR). Recent reports suggested that the VR of DENV-2 is required for efficient virus growth in mammalian cells. To investigate whether this is also true for the VR of DENV-1, deletion or replacement mutations were introduced into the VR by using recombinant DENV-1 cDNA clones. Recombinant viruses with deletion of either or both subregions exhibited reduced growth properties compared with the original virus. Mutants with incompletely reversed or unrelated sequences in the HVR demonstrated growth properties similar to those of the original virus. However, a replacement mutation in the SVR did not cause recovery of growth properties. Furthermore, the amount of viral RNA was decreased in Vero cells infected with the growth-attenuated mutant viruses. Results of reporter translation assays suggest that VR mutations may not affect the translation process of DENV-1. These data indicate that the VR is important for DENV-1 replication and is associated with the accumulation of DENV-1 RNA in mammalian cells, and that the HVR and SVR in the VR may have different roles in DENV-1 replication.

TI  - Chemokine Induction by Dengue Virus Infection: Mechanisms and the Role of Viral Proteins: a Dissertation
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - The focus of this thesis is the role of dengue virus in the induction of chemokines. Dengue virus (DENV) occurs as four distinct serotypes, called DENV 1,2,3,and 4. Symptomatic DENV infection ranges from a self limited febrile illness, dengue fever (DF), to a more severe disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). DHF is characterized by increased capillary permeability resulting in decreased plasma volume, which may be accompanied by hemorrhagic manifestations. Many factors including T cell cross reactivity, viral burden, antibody dependent enhancement and induction of chemokines and cytokines have been reported in DHF and may play a role in the pathogenesis of DENV infection. Cytokines have been shown to modulate endothelial cell permeability [1-3]. Recent studies have shown that DENV-infected endothelial cells secrete the chemokine, interleukin (IL)-8 in vitro [4]. In addition, the permeability of an endothelial cell monolayer was found to be increased by interleukin-8 (IL-8) in vitro [5]. This thesis examines the effects of DEN2V infection on the induction of chemokines, and specifically, which DEN2V viral protein(s) are involved in the induction of IL-8. The chemokine induction profile following DEN2V infection was initially assessed in various cell lines that may represent potential targets in vivo , including monocytes, liver cells and endothelial cells. We hypothesized that distinct profiles of chemokine secretion can be induced by DEN2V infection of various cell types in vitro . We found RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted) and IL-8 were induced in two of the five cell lines. DEN2V infection of primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells induced RANTES and IL-8 along with macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), MIP-1β and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) but at an earlier time post infection than in the cell lines. These results showed that DEN2V infection induces distinct chemokine profiles in many cell types. In addition, monocytic-derived DCs can secrete chemokines upon infection with DEN2V. Characterization of the signaling pathways induced by DEN2V revealed that DEN2V induction of chemokines in human embryonic kidney (HEK293A) cells is mainly through the nuclear factor kappaB (NFκB) pathway, as previously reported for endothelial cells and 293T cells [4,6]. Alternatively, the liver cell line (HepG2) activated mainly activator protein (AP)-l. In addition, DENV infection can induce the activation of the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) driven promoter. IL-8 has been shown to have multiple effects on the immune system ranging from recruiting cells to the site of infection to countering the antiviral effects of type I interferon (IFN) [7,8]. Previous reports have shown that viral proteins can induce chemokines such as seen with IL-8 induction with the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) and core proteins from hepatitis C virus [9,10]. We hypothesized that protein(s)…

TI  - Cholesterol Effectively Blocks Entry of Flavivirus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 6470
EP  - 6480
AB  - ABSTRACT Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN-2) are enveloped flaviviruses that enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis and low pH-triggered membrane fusion and then replicate in intracellular membrane structures. Lipid rafts, cholesterol-enriched lipid-ordered membrane domains, are platforms for a variety of cellular functions. In this study, we found that disruption of lipid raft formation by cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin or cholesterol chelation with filipin III reduces JEV and DEN-2 infection, mainly at the intracellular replication steps and, to a lesser extent, at viral entry. Using a membrane flotation assay, we found that several flaviviral nonstructural proteins are associated with detergent-resistant membrane structures, indicating that the replication complex of JEV and DEN-2 localizes to the membranes that possess the lipid raft property. Interestingly, we also found that addition of cholesterol readily blocks flaviviral infection, a result that contrasts with previous reports of other viruses, such as Sindbis virus, whose infectivity is enhanced by cholesterol. Cholesterol mainly affected the early step of the flavivirus life cycle, because the presence of cholesterol during viral adsorption greatly blocked JEV and DEN-2 infectivity. Flavirial entry, probably at fusion and RNA uncoating steps, was hindered by cholesterol. Our results thus suggest a stringent requirement for membrane components, especially with respect to the amount of cholesterol, in various steps of the flavivirus life cycle.

TI  - Chronic depletion of vertebrate lipids in Aedes aegypti cells dysregulates lipid metabolism and inhibits innate immunity without altering dengue infectivity
JF  - PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 16
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of dengue virus (DENV) and other arboviruses. Previous literature suggests that vertebrate and invertebrate lipids and the nutritional status of mosquitoes modify virus infection. Here, we developed a vertebrate lipid-depleted Ae. aegypti cell line to investigate if chronic depletion of vertebrate lipids normally present in a blood meal and insect cell culture medium would impact cell growth and virus infection. Chronic depletion of vertebrate lipids reduced cell size and proliferation, although cells retained equivalent total intracellular lipids per cell by reducing lipolysis and modifying gene expression related to sugar and lipid metabolism. Downregulation of innate immunity genes was also observed. We hypothesized that chronic depletion of vertebrate lipids would impact virus infection; however, the same amount of DENV was produced per cell. This study reveals how Ae. aegypti cells adapt in the absence of vertebrate lipids, and how DENV can replicate equally well in cells that contain predominately vertebrate or invertebrate lipids.

AB  - Dengue fever, caused by dengue virus, poses a significant global health challenge, particularly in tropical regions where Aedes aegypti serves as the primary vector. The circadian clock in Aedes aegypti governs key behavioral and physiological processes, including activity patterns, feeding behaviors, and susceptibility to dengue virus infection. This article explores the influence of circadian rhythms on the mosquito’s ability to transmit dengue virus, emphasizing how the circadian regulation of gene expression, immune responses, and lipid metabolism in the mosquito vector creates temporal windows that affect viral replication efficiency.

EP  - 9802
AB  - Abstract Members of the Flaviviridae family, including dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus, cause serious disease in humans, whilst maternal infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) can induce microcephaly in newborns. Following infection, flaviviral RNA genomes are translated to produce the viral replication machinery but must then serve as a template for the transcription of new genomes. However, the ribosome and viral polymerase proceed in opposite directions along the RNA, risking collisions and abortive replication. Whilst generally linear, flavivirus genomes can adopt a circular conformation facilitated by long-range RNA–RNA interactions, shown to be essential for replication. Using an in vitro reconstitution approach, we demonstrate that circularization inhibits de novo translation initiation on ZIKV and DENV RNA, whilst the linear conformation is translation-competent. Our results provide a mechanism to clear the viral RNA of ribosomes in order to promote efficient replication and, therefore, define opposing roles for linear and circular conformations of the flavivirus genome.

TI  - Class II ADP-ribosylation Factors Are Required for Efficient Secretion of Dengue Viruses*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 287
SP  - 767
EP  - 777
AB  - Background: To date, very few cellular factors required for secretion of flaviviruses have been described. Results: Simultaneous depletion of class II Arf (Arf4 and Arf5) blocks dengue flavivirus secretion, without altering the constitutive secretory pathway. Dengue glycoprotein prM interacts with Arf4 and Arf5. Conclusion: Arf4 and Arf5 play a crucial role in dengue flavivirus secretion. Significance: Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism of dengue flavivirus secretion. Identification and characterization of virus-host interactions are very important steps toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for disease progression and pathogenesis. To date, very few cellular factors involved in the life cycle of flaviviruses, which are important human pathogens, have been described. In this study, we demonstrate a crucial role for class II Arf proteins (Arf4 and Arf5) in the dengue flavivirus life cycle. We show that simultaneous depletion of Arf4 and Arf5 blocks recombinant subviral particle secretion for all four dengue serotypes. Immunostaining analysis suggests that class II Arf proteins are required at an early pre-Golgi step for dengue virus secretion. Using a horseradish peroxidase protein fused to a signal peptide, we show that class II Arfs act specifically on dengue virus secretion without altering the secretion of proteins through the constitutive secretory pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation data demonstrate that the dengue prM glycoprotein interacts with class II Arf proteins but not through its C-terminal VXPX motif. Finally, experiments performed with replication-competent dengue and yellow fever viruses demonstrate that the depletion of class II Arfs inhibits virus secretion, thus confirming their implication in the virus life cycle, although data obtained with West Nile virus pointed out the differences in virus-host interactions among flaviviruses. Our findings shed new light on a molecular mechanism used by dengue viruses during the late stages of the life cycle and demonstrate a novel function for class II Arf proteins.

TI  - Cleavage of dengue virus NS1-NS2A requires an octapeptide sequence at the C terminus of NS1
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 64
SP  - 4573
EP  - 4577
AB  - The length of amino acid sequence at the NS1-NS2A juncture of dengue virus that is required for specific cleavage effected by the cis-acting function of NS2A was identified by deletion analysis. Recombinant DNA sequences of NS1-NS2A, each containing a deletion in NS1 followed by a sequence of 3 to 20 amino acids at the C terminus of NS1 preceding the cleavage site, were constructed and expressed with vaccinia virus as a vector. The NS1 product of recombinant vaccinia virus-infected cells was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The occurrence of cleavage between NS1 and NS2A was indicated by the appearance of shortened NS1. Failure to cleave this site yielded a large NS1-NS2A fusion protein. This analysis indicated that a minimum length of eight amino acids at the NS1 C terminus preceding the NS1-NS2A juncture is required for cleavage to take place. Comparison of this eight-amino-acid sequence of the NS1 C terminus of dengue type 4 virus with the analogous sequences of 12 other flaviviruses suggests that the consensus cleavage site sequence is as follows: (table; see text)

TI  - Cleavage of the dengue virus polyprotein at the NS3/NS4A and NS4B/NS5 junctions is mediated by viral protease NS2B-NS3, whereas NS4A/NS4B may be processed by a cellular protease
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 66
SP  - 1535
EP  - 1542
AB  - The cleavage mechanism utilized for processing of the NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 domain of the dengue virus polyprotein was studied by using the vaccinia virus expression system. Recombinant vaccinia viruses vNS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5, vNS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5, vNS4A-NS4B-NS5, and vNS4B-NS5 were constructed. These recombinants were used to infect cells, and the labeled lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Recombinant vNS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 expressed the authentic NS3 and NS5 proteins, but the other recombinants produced uncleaved polyproteins. These findings indicate that NS2B is required for processing of the downstream nonstructural proteins, including the NS3/NS4A and NS4B/NS5 junctions, both of which contain a dibasic amino acid sequence preceding the cleavage site. The flavivirus NS4A/NS4B cleavage site follows a long hydrophobic sequence. The polyprotein NS4A-NS4B-NS5 was cleaved at the NS4A/NS4B junction in the absence of other dengue virus functions. One interpretation for this finding is that NS4A/NS4B cleavage is mediated by a host protease, presumably a signal peptidase. Although vNS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 expressed only the polyprotein, earlier results demonstrated that cleavage at the NS4A/NS4B junction occurred when an analogous recombinant, vNS3-NS4A-84%NS4B, was expressed. Thus, it appears that uncleaved NS3 plus NS5 inhibit NS4A/NS4B cleavage presumably because the putative signal sequence is not accessible for recognition by the responsible protease. Finally, recombinants that expressed an uncleaved NS4B-NS5 polyprotein, such as vNS4A-NS4B-NS5 or vNS4B-NS5, produced NS5 when complemented with vNS2B-30%NS3 or with vNS2B plus v30%NS3. These results indicate that cleavage at the NS4B/NS5 junction can be mediated by NS2B and NS3 in trans.

JF  - The Biochemical journal
VL  - 401 3
SP  - 743
EP  - 52
AB  - Regulated proteolysis of the polyprotein precursor by the NS2B-NS3 protease is required for the propagation of infectious virions. Unless the structural and functional parameters of NS2B-NS3 are precisely determined, an understanding of its functional role and the design of flaviviral inhibitors will be exceedingly difficult. Our objectives were to define the substrate recognition pattern of the NS2B-NS3 protease of West Nile and Dengue virises (WNV and DV respectively). To accomplish our goals, we used an efficient, 96-well plate format, method for the synthesis of 9-mer peptide substrates with the general P4-P3-P2-P1-P1'-P2'-P3'-P4'-Gly structure. The N-terminus and the constant C-terminal Gly of the peptides were tagged with a fluorescent tag and with a biotin tag respectively. The synthesis was followed by the proteolytic cleavage of the synthesized, tagged peptides. Because of the strict requirement for the presence of basic amino acid residues at the P1 and the P2 substrate positions, the analysis of approx. 300 peptide sequences was sufficient for an adequate representation of the cleavage preferences of the WNV and DV proteinases. Our results disclosed the strict substrate specificity of the WNV protease for which the (K/R)(K/R)R/GG amino acid motifs was optimal. The DV protease was less selective and it tolerated well the presence of a number of amino acid residue types at either the P1' or the P2' site, as long as the other position was occupied by a glycine residue. We believe that our data represent a valuable biochemical resource and a solid foundation to support the design of selective substrates and synthetic inhibitors of flaviviral proteinases.

JF  - Journal of Microscopy
VL  - 231
AB  - In recent years, the application of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to biological systems has highlighted the potential of this technology. AFM provides insights into studies of biological structures and interactions and can also identify and characterize a large panel of pathogens, including viruses. The Flaviviridae family contains a number of viruses that are important human and animal pathogens. Among them, Dengue virus causes epidemics with fatal outcomes mainly in the tropics. In this study, Dengue virus is visualized for the first time using the in air AFM technique. Images were obtained from a potassium‐tartrate gradient‐purified virus. This study enhances the application of AFM as a novel tool for the visualization and characterization of virus particles. Because flavivirus members are closely related, studies of the morphologic structure of the Dengue virus can reveal strategies that may be useful to identify and study other important viruses in the family, including the West Nile virus.

AB  - Inter-host transmission of pathogenic arboviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) requires systemic infection of the mosquito vector. Successful systemic infection requires initial viral entry and proliferation in the midgut cells of the mosquito followed by dissemination to secondary tissues and eventual entry into salivary glands1. Lack of arbovirus proliferation in midgut cells has been observed in several Aedes aegypti strains2, but the midgut antiviral responses underlying this phenomenon are not yet fully understood. We report here that there is a rapid induction of apoptosis (RIA) in the Aedes aegypti midgut epithelium within 2 hours of infection with DENV-2 or ZIKV in both in vivo blood-feeding and ex vivo midgut infection models. Inhibition of RIA led to increased virus proliferation in the midgut, implicating RIA as an innate immune mechanism mediating midgut infection in this mosquito vector. Ayers et al. report rapid induction of apoptosis in the midgut of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes within 2 hours of infection by dengue and Zika viruses, and find that inhibiting apoptosis led to increased virus proliferation in the midgut. These results suggest rapid induction of apoptosis as an innate immune mechanism mediating midgut infection in this mosquito vector.

AB  - Infections with dengue virus (DENV) are a significant public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions. However, little detail is known about how DENV interacts with the host-cell machinery to facilitate its translation and replication. In DENV-infected HepG2 cells, an increase in the level of LC3-II (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 form II), the autophagosomal membrane-bound form of LC3, was observed, and LC3 was found to co-localize with dsRNA and DENV NS1 protein, as well as ribosomal protein L28, indicating the presence of at least some of the DENV translation/replication machinery on autophagic vacuoles. Inhibition of fusion of autophagic vacuoles with lysosomes resulted in an increase in both intracellular and extracellular virus, and co-localization observed between mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR) and dsRNA and between MPR and LC3 identified the autophagic vacuoles as amphisomes. Amphisomes are formed as a result of fusion between endosomal and autophagic vacuoles, and as such provide a direct link between virus entry and subsequent replication and translation.

TI  - Collateral Damage during Dengue Virus Infection: Making Sense of DNA by cGAS
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT Early sensing of viral components or infection-induced tissue damage is a prerequisite for the successful control of pathogenic viruses by the host innate immune system. Recent results from our laboratory show how immune cells use the DNA-sensing machinery to detect intracellular damage generated early during infection by an RNA virus, namely, dengue virus (DENV). Conversely, we found that DENV can efficiently dismantle this sensing mechanism by targeting the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and the stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING), two crucial host factors involved in DNA detection and type I IFN production. These findings highlight the relevance of the DNA-sensing mechanism in the detection and control of infections by RNA viruses. In this review, we discuss how DENV modulates the innate immune DNA-sensing pathway, activated in the context of cellular damage during infection.

TI  - Combining Wolbachia-induced sterility and virus protection to fight Aedes albopictus-borne viruses
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 12
AB  - Among the strategies targeting vector control, the exploitation of the endosymbiont Wolbachia to produce sterile males and/or invasive females with reduced vector competence seems to be promising. A new Aedes albopictus transinfection (ARwP-M) was generated by introducing wMel Wolbachia in the ARwP line which had been established previously by replacing wAlbA and wAlbB Wolbachia with the wPip strain. Various infection and fitness parameters were studied by comparing ARwP-M, ARwP and wild-type (SANG population) Ae. albopictus sharing the same genetic background. Moreover, the vector competence of ARwP-M related to chikungunya, dengue and zika viruses was evaluated in comparison with ARwP. ARwP-M showed a 100% rate of maternal inheritance of wMel and wPip Wolbachia. Survival, female fecundity and egg fertility did not show to differ between the three Ae. albopictus lines. Crosses between ARwP-M males and SANG females were fully unfertile regardless of male age while egg hatch in reverse crosses increased from 0 to about 17% with SANG males aging from 3 to 17 days. When competing with SANG males for SANG females, ARwP-M males induced a level of sterility significantly higher than that expected for an equal mating competitiveness (mean Fried index of 1.71 instead of 1). The overall Wolbachia density in ARwP-M females was about 15 fold higher than in ARwP, mostly due to the wMel infection. This feature corresponded to a strongly reduced vector competence for chikungunya and dengue viruses (in both cases, 5 and 0% rates of transmission at 14 and 21 days post infection) with respect to ARwP females. Results regarding Zika virus did not highlight significant differences between ARwP-M and ARwP. However, none of the tested ARwP-M females was capable at transmitting ZIKV. These findings are expected to promote the exploitation of Wolbachia to suppress the wild-type Ae. albopictus populations.

TI  - Comparison of Dengue Virus Type 2-Specific Small RNAs from RNA Interference-Competent and –Incompetent Mosquito Cells
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 4
AB  - The exogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathway is an important antiviral defense against arboviruses in mosquitoes, and virus-specific small interfering (si)RNAs are key components of this pathway. Understanding the biogenesis of siRNAs in mosquitoes could have important ramifications in using RNAi to control arbovirus transmission. Using deep sequencing technology, we characterized dengue virus type 2 (DENV2)-specific small RNAs produced during infection of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and A. aegypti Aag2 cell cultures and compared them to those produced in the C6/36 Aedes albopictus cell line. We show that the size and mixed polarity of virus-specific small RNAs from DENV-infected A. aegypti cells indicate that they are products of Dicer-2 (Dcr2) cleavage of long dsRNA, whereas C6/36 cells generate DENV2-specific small RNAs that are longer and predominantly positive polarity, suggesting that they originate from a different small RNA pathway. Examination of virus-specific small RNAs after infection of the two mosquito cell lines with the insect-only flavivirus cell fusing agent virus (CFAV) corroborated these findings. An in vitro assay also showed that Aag2 A. aegypti cells are capable of siRNA production, while C6/36 A. albopictus cells exhibit inefficient Dcr2 cleavage of long dsRNA. Defective expression or function of Dcr2, the key initiator of the RNAi pathway, might explain the comparatively robust growth of arthropod-borne viruses in the C6/36 cell line, which has been used frequently as a surrogate for studying molecular interactions between arboviruses and cells of their mosquito hosts.

AB  - Fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis is useful for the detection of cellular surface antigens and intracellular proteins. We used this methodology in order to detect and quantify dengue antigens in highly susceptible cells such as clone C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) and Vero cells (green monkey kidney). Additionally, we analyzed the infection in vitro of human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML). FACS analysis turned out to be a reliable technique to quantify virus growth in traditional cell cultures of C6/36 as well as Vero cells. High rates of infection were achieved with a good statistical correlation between the virus amount used in infection and the percentage of dengue antigen containing cells detected in infected cultures. We also showed that human monocytes (CD14+) are preferred target cells for in vitro dengue infection among PBML. Monocytes were much less susceptible to virus infection than cell lines but they displayed dengue antigens detected by FACS five days after infection. In contrast, lymphocytes showed no differences in their profile for dengue specific immunofluorescence. Without an animal model to reproduce dengue disease, alternative assays have been sought to correlate viral virulence with clinical manifestations and disease severity. Study of in vitro interaction of virus and host cells may highlight this relationship.

TI  - Complement alternative pathway genetic variation and Dengue infection in the Thai population
JF  - Clinical and Experimental Immunology
VL  - 174
SP  - 326
EP  - 334
AB  - Dengue disease is a mosquito‐borne infection caused by Dengue virus. Infection may be asymptomatic or variably manifest as mild Dengue fever (DF) to the most severe form, Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Mechanisms that influence disease severity are not understood. Complement, an integral component of the immune system, is activated during Dengue infection and the degree of activation increases with disease severity. Activation of the complement alternative pathway is influenced by polymorphisms within activation (factor B rs12614/rs641153, C3 rs2230199) and regulatory [complement factor H (CFH) rs800292] proteins, collectively termed a complotype. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the complotype influences disease severity during secondary Dengue infection. In addition to the complotype, we also assessed two other disease‐associated CFH polymorphisms (rs1061170, rs3753394) and a structural polymorphism within the CFH protein family. We did not detect any significant association between the examined polymorphisms and Dengue infection severity in the Thai population. However, the minor allele frequencies of the factor B and C3 polymorphisms were less than 10%, so our study was not sufficiently powered to detect an association at these loci. We were also unable to detect a direct interaction between CFH and Dengue NS1 using both recombinant NS1 and DV2‐infected culture supernatants. We conclude that the complotype does not influence secondary Dengue infection severity in the Thai population.

TI  - Complement protein levels and MBL2 polymorphisms are associated with dengue and disease severity
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 10
AB  - The complement system may be crucial during dengue virus infection and progression to severe dengue. This study investigates the role of MBL2 genetic variants and levels of MBL in serum and complement proteins in Vietnamese dengue patients. MBL2 genotypes (− 550L/H, MBL2 codon 54), MBL2 diplotypes (XA/XO, YA/XO) and MBL2 haplotypes (LXPB, HXPA, XO) were associated with dengue in the study population. The levels of complement factors C2, C5, and C5a were higher in dengue and dengue with warning signs (DWS) patients compared to those in healthy controls, while factor D levels were decreased in dengue and DWS patients compared to the levels determined in healthy controls. C2 and C5a levels were associated with the levels of AST and ALT and with WBC counts. C9 levels were negatively correlated with ALT levels and WBC counts, and factor D levels were associated with AST and ALT levels and with platelet counts. In conclusions, MBL2 polymorphisms are associated with dengue in the Vietnamese study population. The levels of the complement proteins C2, C4b, C5, C5a, C9, factor D and factor I are modulated in dengue patients during the clinical course of dengue.

TI  - Complement receptor type 1 and 2 (CR1 and CR2) gene polymorphisms and plasma protein levels are associated with the Dengue disease severity
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 13
AB  - The pathological outcome of dengue disease results from complex interactions between dengue virus (DENV) and host genetics and immune response. Complement receptor types 1 and 2 (CR1 and CR2) mediate complement activation through the alternative pathway. This study investigated the possible association of genetic polymorphisms and plasma levels of CR1 and CR2 with dengue disease. A total of 267 dengue patients and 133 healthy controls were recruited for this study. CR1 and CR2 gene polymorphisms were analyzed by Sanger sequencing, while plasma CR1 and CR2 levels were measured by ELISA. The frequency of the CR1 minor allele rs6691117G was lower in dengue patients and those with severe dengue compared to healthy controls. Plasma CR1 and CR2 levels were decreased in dengue patients compared to healthy controls ( P  < 0.0001) and were associated with platelet counts. CR1 levels were lower in dengue patients with warning signs (DWS) compared to those without DWS, while CR2 levels were decreased according to the severity of the disease and after 5 days (T1) and 8 days (T2) of follow-up. CR2 levels were decreased in dengue patients positive for anti-DENV IgG and IgM and patients with bleeding and could discriminate DWS and SD from dengue fever patients (AUC = 0.66). In conclusion, this study revealed a reduction in CR2 levels in dengue patients and that the CR1 SNP rs6691117A/G is associated with the dengue severity. The correlation of CR2 levels with platelet counts suggests that CR2 could be an additional biomarker for the prognosis of severe dengue disease.

TI  - Complement-Mediated Neutralization of Dengue Virus Requires Mannose-Binding Lectin
JF  - mBio
VL  - 2
AB  - ABSTRACT Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a key soluble pathogen recognition protein of the innate immune system that binds specific mannose-containing glycans on the surfaces of microbial agents and initiates complement activation via the lectin pathway. Prior studies showed that MBL-dependent activation of the complement cascade neutralized insect cell-derived West Nile virus (WNV) in cell culture and restricted pathogenesis in mice. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of MBL in infection by dengue virus (DENV), a related flavivirus. Using a panel of naïve sera from mouse strains deficient in different complement components, we showed that inhibition of infection by insect cell- and mammalian cell-derived DENV was primarily dependent on the lectin pathway. Human MBL also bound to DENV and neutralized infection of all four DENV serotypes through complement activation-dependent and -independent pathways. Experiments with human serum from naïve individuals with inherent variation in the levels of MBL in blood showed a direct correlation between the concentration of MBL and neutralization of DENV; samples with high levels of MBL in blood neutralized DENV more efficiently than those with lower levels. Our studies suggest that allelic variation of MBL in humans may impact complement-dependent control of DENV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that causes a spectrum of clinical disease in humans ranging from subclinical infection to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Four serotypes of DENV exist, and severe illness is usually associated with secondary infection by a different serotype. Here, we show that mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a pattern recognition molecule that initiates the lectin pathway of complement activation, neutralized infection of all four DENV serotypes through complement activation-dependent and -independent pathways. Moreover, we observed a direct correlation with the concentration of MBL in human serum and neutralization of DENV infection. Our studies suggest that common genetic polymorphisms that result in disparate levels and function of MBL in humans may impact DENV infection, pathogenesis, and disease severity.

TI  - Complex Modulation of the Aedes aegypti Transcriptome in Response to Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Dengue fever is the most important arboviral disease world-wide, with Aedes aegypti being the major vector. Interactions between the mosquito host and dengue viruses (DENV) are complex and vector competence varies among geographically-distinct Ae. aegypti populations. Additionally, dengue is caused by four antigenically-distinct viral serotypes (DENV1–4), each with multiple genotypes. Each virus genotype interacts differently with vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Analyses of alterations in mosquito transcriptional profiles during DENV infection are expected to provide the basis for identifying networks of genes involved in responses to viruses and contribute to the molecular-genetic understanding of vector competence. In addition, this knowledge is anticipated to support the development of novel disease-control strategies. RNA-seq technology was used to assess genome-wide changes in transcript abundance at 1, 4 and 14 days following DENV2 infection in carcasses, midguts and salivary glands of the Ae. aegypti Chetumal strain. DENV2 affected the expression of 397 Ae. aegypti genes, most of which were down-regulated by viral infection. Differential accumulation of transcripts was mainly tissue- and time-specific. Comparisons of our data with other published reports reveal conservation of functional classes, but limited concordance of specific mosquito genes responsive to DENV2 infection. These results indicate the necessity of additional studies of mosquito-DENV interactions, specifically those focused on recently-derived mosquito strains with multiple dengue virus serotypes and genotypes.

TI  - Comprehensive DNA methylation analysis of the Aedes aegypti genome
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 6
AB  - Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are important vectors of viral diseases. Mosquito host factors play key roles in virus control and it has been suggested that dengue virus replication is regulated by Dnmt2-mediated DNA methylation. However, recent studies have shown that Dnmt2 is a tRNA methyltransferase and that Dnmt2-dependent methylomes lack defined DNA methylation patterns, thus necessitating a systematic re-evaluation of the mosquito genome methylation status. We have now searched the Ae. aegypti genome for candidate DNA modification enzymes. This failed to reveal any known (cytosine-5) DNA methyltransferases, but identified homologues for the Dnmt2 tRNA methyltransferase, the Mettl4 (adenine-6) DNA methyltransferase, and the Tet DNA demethylase. All genes were expressed at variable levels throughout mosquito development. Mass spectrometry demonstrated that DNA methylation levels were several orders of magnitude below the levels that are usually detected in organisms with DNA methylation-dependent epigenetic regulation. Furthermore, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing failed to reveal any evidence of defined DNA methylation patterns. These results suggest that the Ae. aegypti genome is unmethylated. Interestingly, additional RNA bisulfite sequencing provided first evidence for Dnmt2-mediated tRNA methylation in mosquitoes. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanism of Dnmt2-dependent virus regulation.

TI  - Comprehensive analysis of dengue virus-specific responses supports an HLA-linked protective role for CD8+ T cells
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 110
SP  - E2046
EP  - E2053
AB  - Significance Dengue virus is the etiologic agent of dengue fever, the most significant mosquito-borne viral disease in humans, affecting over 100 million individuals each year. Currently there is no licensed vaccine or effective antiviral therapy available, and treatment is largely supportive in nature. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of functional T-cell memory against dengue viruses and suggests an HLA-linked protective role for CD8+ T cells. This demonstration of the protective role of T-cell responses points the way forward to identifying robust correlates of protection in natural immunity and vaccination against dengue virus. The role of CD8+ T cells in dengue virus infection and subsequent disease manifestations is not fully understood. According to the original antigenic sin theory, skewing of T-cell responses induced by primary infection with one serotype causes less effective response upon secondary infection with a different serotype, predisposing individuals to severe disease. A comprehensive analysis of CD8+ responses in the general population from the Sri Lankan hyperendemic area, involving the measurement of ex vivo IFNγ responses associated with more than 400 epitopes, challenges the original antigenic sin theory. Although skewing of responses toward primary infecting viruses was detected, this was not associated with impairment of responses either qualitatively or quantitatively. Furthermore, we demonstrate higher magnitude and more polyfunctional responses for HLA alleles associated with decreased susceptibility to severe disease, suggesting that a vigorous response by multifunctional CD8+ T cells is associated with protection from dengue virus disease.

TI  - Comprehensive proteome profiling in Aedes albopictus to decipher Wolbachia-arbovirus interference phenomenon
JF  - BMC Genomics
VL  - 18
AB  - Aedes albopictus is a vector of arboviruses that cause severe diseases in humans such as Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika fevers. The vector competence of Ae. albopictus varies depending on the mosquito population involved and the virus transmitted. Wolbachia infection status in believed to be among key elements that determine viral transmission efficiency. Little is known about the cellular functions mobilized in Ae. albopictus during co-infection by Wolbachia and a given arbovirus. To decipher this tripartite interaction at the molecular level, we performed a proteome analysis in Ae. albopictus C6/36 cells mono-infected by Wolbachia wAlbB strain or Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and bi-infected. We first confirmed significant inhibition of CHIKV by Wolbachia. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, we identified 600 unique differentially expressed proteins mostly related to glycolysis, translation and protein metabolism. Wolbachia infection had greater impact on cellular functions than CHIKV infection, inducing either up or down-regulation of proteins associated with metabolic processes such as glycolysis and ATP metabolism, or structural glycoproteins and capsid proteins in the case of bi-infection with CHIKV. CHIKV infection inhibited expression of proteins linked with the processes of transcription, translation, lipid storage and miRNA pathways. The results of our proteome profiling have provided new insights into the molecular pathways involved in tripartite Ae. albopictus-Wolbachia-CHIKV interaction and may help defining targets for the better implementation of Wolbachia-based strategies for disease transmission control.

TI  - Computational and Experimental Approaches to Study the RNA Secondary Structures of RNA Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Most pandemics of recent decades can be traced to RNA viruses, including HIV, SARS, influenza, dengue, Zika, and SARS-CoV-2. These RNA viruses impose considerable social and economic burdens on our society, resulting in a high number of deaths and high treatment costs. As these RNA viruses utilize an RNA genome, which is important for different stages of the viral life cycle, including replication, translation, and packaging, studying how the genome folds is important to understand virus function. In this review, we summarize recent advances in computational and high-throughput RNA structure-mapping approaches and their use in understanding structures within RNA virus genomes. In particular, we focus on the genome structures of the dengue, Zika, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses due to recent significant outbreaks of these viruses around the world.

TI  - Condensation of RNase L promotes its rapid activation in response to viral infection in mammalian cells
JF  - Science Signaling
VL  - 17
AB  - Oligoadenylate synthetase 3 (OAS3) and ribonuclease L (RNase L) are components of a pathway that combats viral infection in mammals. Upon detection of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), OAS3 synthesizes 2′-5′-oligo(A), which activates the RNase domain of RNase L by promoting the homodimerization and oligomerization of RNase L monomers. Activated RNase L rapidly degrades all cellular mRNAs, shutting off several cellular processes. We sought to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the rapid activation of RNase L in response to viral infection. Through superresolution microscopy and live-cell imaging, we showed that OAS3 and RNase L concentrated into higher-order cytoplasmic complexes known as dsRNA-induced foci (dRIF) in response to dsRNA or infection with dengue virus, Zika virus, or West Nile virus. The concentration of OAS3 and RNase L at dRIF corresponded with the activation of RNase L–mediated RNA decay. We showed that dimerized/oligomerized RNase L concentrated in a liquid-like shell surrounding a core OAS3-dRIF structure and dynamically exchanged with the cytosol. These data establish that the condensation of dsRNA, OAS3, and RNase L into dRIF is a molecular switch that promotes the rapid activation of RNase L upon detection of dsRNA in mammalian cells. Rapid RNA decay is initiated by the condensation of antiviral proteins during infection by RNA viruses. Editor’s summary Detection of viral double-stranded RNA by OAS3 rapidly induces the activation of RNase L, which results in the degradation of all cellular RNA. Cusic and Burke investigated the regulation of RNase L activation in mammalian cells. Double-stranded RNA or infection with RNA viruses, such as dengue, Zika, or West Nile virus, induced the condensation of OAS3 and active RNase L into cytoplasmic granules. These granules were composed of an OAS3–double-stranded RNA core surrounded by a shell of RNase L, which dynamically exchanged with a cytoplasmic pool. In addition to rapidly activating RNase L, the condensation of RNase L and OAS3 may also set a threshold to prevent spurious activation and the shutdown of cellular processes that occur with mRNA degradation. —Wei Wong

VL  - 11
AB  - The recent explosive pandemic of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) followed by Zika (ZIKV) virus infections occurring throughout many countries represents the most unexpected arrival of arthropod-borne viral diseases in the past 20 years. Transmitted through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes, the clinical picture associated with these acute arbovirus infections, including Dengue (DENV), CHIKV and ZIKV, ranges from classical febrile illness to life-threatening disease. Whereas ZIKV and CHIKV-mediated infections have previously been recognized as relatively benign diseases, in contrast to Dengue fever, recent epidemic events have brought waves of increased morbidity and mortality leading to a serious public health problem. Although the host immune response plays a crucial role in controlling infections, it may also promote viral spread and immunopathology. Here, we review recent developments in our understanding of the immune response, with an emphasis on the early antiviral immune response mediated by natural killer cells and emphasize their Janus-faced effects in the control of arbovirus infection and pathogenesis. Improving our understanding knowledge on of the mechanisms that control viral infection is crucial in the current race against the globalization of arbovirus epidemics.

AB  - Dengue fever is the most important arthropod-borne viral disease worldwide, affecting 50–100 million individuals annually. The clinical picture associated with acute dengue virus (DENV) infections ranges from classical febrile illness to life-threatening disease. The innate immunity is the first line of defense in the control of viral replication. This review will examine the particular role of natural killer (NK) cells in DENV infection. Over recent years, our understanding of the interplay between NK cells and viral pathogenesis has improved significantly. NK cells express an array of inhibitory and activating receptors that enable them to detect infected targets while sparing normal cells, and to recruit adaptive immune cells. To date, the exact mechanism by which NK cells may contribute to the control of DENV infection remains elusive. Importantly, DENV has acquired mechanisms to evade NK cell responses, further underlining the relevance of these cells in pathophysiology. Hence, understanding how NK cells affect the outcome of DENV infection could benefit the management of this acute disease.

TI  - Control of Translation by the 5′- and 3′-Terminal Regions of the Dengue Virus Genome
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 8303
EP  - 8315
AB  - ABSTRACT The genomic RNAs of flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DEN) have a 5′ m7GpppN cap like those of cellular mRNAs but lack a 3′ poly(A) tail. We have studied the contributions to translational expression of 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of the DEN serotype 2 genome by using luciferase reporter mRNAs transfected into Vero cells. DCLD RNA contained the entire DEN 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), as well as the first 36 codons of the capsid coding region fused to the luciferase reporter gene. Capped DCLD RNA was as efficiently translated in Vero cells as capped GLGpA RNA, a reporter with UTRs from the highly expressed α-globin mRNA and a 72-residue poly(A) tail. Analogous reporter RNAs with regulatory sequences from West Nile and Sindbis viruses were also strongly expressed. Although capped DCLD RNA was expressed much more efficiently than its uncapped form, uncapped DCLD RNA was translated 6 to 12 times more efficiently than uncapped RNAs with UTRs from globin mRNA. The 5′ cap and DEN 3′ UTR were the main sources of the translational efficiency of DCLD RNA, and they acted synergistically in enhancing translation. The DEN 3′ UTR increased mRNA stability, although this effect was considerably weaker than the enhancement of translational efficiency. The DEN 3′ UTR thus has translational regulatory properties similar to those of a poly(A) tail. Its translation-enhancing effect was observed for RNAs with globin or DEN 5′ sequences, indicating no codependency between viral 5′ and 3′ sequences. Deletion studies showed that translational enhancement provided by the DEN 3′ UTR is attributable to the cumulative contributions of several conserved elements, as well as a nonconserved domain adjacent to the stop codon. One of the conserved elements was the conserved sequence (CS) CS1 that is complementary to cCS1 present in the 5′ end of the DEN polyprotein open reading frame. Complementarity between CS1 and cCS1 was not required for efficient translation.

AB  - Dengue viruses infect more than 100 million people each year and cause serious clinical manifestations. It is important to understand the replication of these viruses so that therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents may be designed. Dengue virus type 2 nonstructural proteins NS-5 and NS-3 were produced by in vitro transcription and translation of cloned genes. Both proteins possessed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity as measured by their ability to convert purified replicative form (RF) RNA to replicative intermediate (RI). The recombinant proteins, however, required one or more cellular protein(s) for their activity. Examination of NS-3 protein sequence revealed heretofore unnoticed sequence similarities with other polymerases.

AB  - Supernatant culture fluids from dengue virus type 4 (DEN-4)-infected cultures of monkey kidney Vero cells and Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells contained the virion structural proteins; secreted NS1 was found only in supernatants from infected Vero cells. Using supernatant culture fluids from [35S]methionine-labelled, virus-infected Vero and C6/36 cells, binding of radiolabelled viral proteins was examined with various cell lines varying in susceptibility to DEN-4 infection. Binding of viral E protein was observed with the highly infectible Vero and LLC-MK2 cell lines, whereas a very small degree of binding was seen with four other cell lines (mouse fibroblast L929, bovine kidney MDBK, human hepatoma Hep G2 and primary human endothelial cells) which are less susceptible to DEN-4 infection. The results suggest that cell susceptibility to DEN-4 may be determined largely at the stage of virus binding, i.e. by the presence of a cell receptor capable of binding viral E protein.

AB  - Background Dysregulated immune responses may contribute to the clinical complications that occur in some patients with dengue. Findings In Vietnamese pediatric dengue cases randomized to early prednisolone therapy, 81 gene-transcripts (0.2% of the 47,231 evaluated) were differentially abundant in whole-blood between high-dose (2 mg/kg) prednisolone and placebo-treated patients two days after commencing therapy. Prominent among the 81 transcripts were those associated with T and NK cell cytolytic functions. Additionally, prednisolone therapy was not associated with changes in plasma cytokine levels. Conclusion The inability of prednisolone treatment to markedly attenuate the host immune response is instructive for planning future therapeutic strategies for dengue.

TI  - Cotranslational Membrane Insertion of the Serine Proteinase Precursor NS2B-NS3(Pro) of Dengue Virus Type 2 Is Required for Efficient in Vitro Processing and Is Mediated through the Hydrophobic Regions of NS2B*

AB  - Polyprotein processing of dengue virus type 2, a positive strand RNA virus, is carried out by the host signal peptidase and a novel two-component viral proteinase of the serine proteinase family, NS2B/NS3(Pro), in the endoplasmic reticulum. Using an in vitro processing system, we examined the cis andtrans cleavages of the 2B/3 and 4B/5 sites by NS2B/NS3(Pro), respectively. Lysates of BHK-21 cells coexpressing NS2B and NS3(Pro) mediated trans cleavage of the 4B/5 sitein vitro, and the protease activity was associated with the membrane fraction. To study the role of membranes in the protease activity of NS2B/NS3(Pro), labeled precursors, NS2B-NS3(Pro), and the mutant ndNS2B-NS3(Pro) in which the functional hydrophilic domain of NS2B was deleted, were analyzed using a coupled in vitrotranscription/translation system (TnT). The results showed that cotranslational addition of microsomal membranes to the TnT reaction markedly enhanced the cis cleavage of the 2B/3 site in a dose-dependent manner. NS2B synthesized in the presence of membranes also facilitated trans cleavage of the 2B/3 site in the mutant precursor. The cleavage products, NS2B and NS3(Pro), were membrane-associated. Furthermore, this membrane requirement was dictated by the hydrophobic regions of NS2B. Deletion of hydrophobic regions of NS2B, leaving only the conserved hydrophilic domain of 40 amino acids, resulted in highly efficient processing of the 2B-3 sitein vitro in the absence of microsomal membranes.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), which is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, causes fever and hemorrhagic disorders in humans. The virus entry process mediated through host receptor molecule(s) is crucial for virus propagation and the pathological progression of dengue disease. Therefore, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying virus entry is essential for an understanding of dengue pathology and for the development of effective new anti-dengue agents. DENV binds to its receptor molecules mediated through a viral envelope (E) protein, followed by incorporation of the virus-receptor complex inside cells. The fusion between incorporated virus particles and host endosome membrane under acidic conditions is mediated through the function of DENV E protein. Carbohydrate molecules, such as sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and glycosphingolipids, and carbohydrate-recognition proteins, termed lectins, inhibit virus entry. This review focuses on carbohydrate-derived entry inhibitors, and also introduces functionally related compounds with similar inhibitory mechanisms against DENV entry.

EP  - 3954
AB  - Dengue virus (DEN), a flavivirus, causes dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, the most common mosquito-borne viral illnesses in humans worldwide. In this study, using STAT1−/− mice bearing two different mutant stat1 alleles in the 129/Sv/Ev background, we demonstrate that IFNR-dependent control of primary DEN infection involves both STAT1-dependent and STAT1-independent mechanisms. The STAT1 pathway is necessary for clearing the initial viral load, whereas the STAT1-independent pathway controls later viral burden and prevents DEN disease in mice. The STAT1-independent responses in mice with primary DEN infection included the early activation of B and NK cells as well as the up-regulation of MHC class I molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells. Infection of bone marrow-derived dendritic cell cultures with either DEN or Sindbis virus, another positive-strand RNA virus, confirmed the early vs late natures of the STAT1-dependent and STAT1-independent pathways. Collectively, these data begin to define the nature of the STAT1-dependent vs the STAT1-independent pathway in vivo.

VL  - 90 Pt 12
SP  - 2902
EP  - 11
AB  - Infection with dengue virus type-2 (DENV-2) begins with virus adherence to cell surface receptors. In endothelial cells (HMEC-1), a cell model for DENV-2 infection, alpha 5 beta 3 integrin has been identified as a putative receptor for the virus. Previous work had suggested that the actin cytoskeleton of HMEC-1 cells plays an important role in virus entry and infection. In the present work, fixed and living HMEC-1 cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein-actin were monitored for actin reorganization after virus inoculation, utilizing fluorescence and time lapse microscopy. Cell infection and production of infective viruses were quantified using an anti-E protein antibody and by measuring the p.f.u. ml(-1). Specific drugs that antagonize actin organization and regulate actin-signalling pathways were tested in viral adhesion and infection assays, as were the expression of dominant-negative Rac1 and Cdc42 proteins. Disorganization of actin precluded infection, while microtubule depolymerization had no effect. Activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 signalling, which occurs upon virus binding, induced reorganization of actin to form filopodia in the cellular periphery. Formation of filopodia was a requirement for virus entry and further cell infection. Expression of the dominant-negative proteins Rac1 and Cdc42 confirmed the role of these GTPases in the actin reorganization that is required to form filopodia. In addition, inhibition of the ATPase activity of myosin II greatly decreased infection, suggesting its participation in filopodial stability. We show here, for the first time, that internalization of DENV-2 into endothelial cells requires viral induction of dynamic filopodia regulated by Rac1 and Cdc42 cross-talk and myosin II motor activities.

JF  - Nature structural & molecular biology

EP  - 110
AB  - Regulated by pH, membrane-anchored proteins E and M function during dengue virus maturation and membrane fusion. Our atomic model of the whole virion from cryo–electron microscopy at 3.5-Å resolution reveals that in the mature virus at neutral extracellular pH, the N-terminal 20-amino-acid segment of M (involving three pH-sensing histidines) latches and thereby prevents spring-loaded E fusion protein from prematurely exposing its fusion peptide. This M latch is fastened at an earlier stage, during maturation at acidic pH in the trans-Golgi network. At a later stage, to initiate infection in response to acidic pH in the late endosome, M releases the latch and exposes the fusion peptide. Thus, M serves as a multistep chaperone of E to control the conformational changes accompanying maturation and infection. These pH-sensitive interactions could serve as targets for drug discovery.

TI  - Crystal Structure of Dengue Virus Type 1 Envelope Protein in the Postfusion Conformation and Its Implications for Membrane Fusion
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83
SP  - 4338
EP  - 4344
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus relies on a conformational change in its envelope protein, E, to fuse the viral lipid membrane with the endosomal membrane and thereby deliver the viral genome into the cytosol. We have determined the crystal structure of a soluble fragment E (sE) of dengue virus type 1 (DEN-1). The protein is in the postfusion conformation even though it was not exposed to a lipid membrane or detergent. At the domain I-domain III interface, 4 polar residues form a tight cluster that is absent in other flaviviral postfusion structures. Two of these residues, His-282 and His-317, are conserved in flaviviruses and are part of the “pH sensor” that triggers the fusogenic conformational change in E, at the reduced pH of the endosome. In the fusion loop, Phe-108 adopts a distinct conformation, forming additional trimer contacts and filling the bowl-shaped concavity observed at the tip of the DEN-2 sE trimer.

TI  - Crystal Structure of a Novel Conformational State of the Flavivirus NS3 Protein: Implications for Polyprotein Processing and Viral Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83
SP  - 12895
EP  - 12906
AB  - ABSTRACT The flavivirus genome comprises a single strand of positive-sense RNA, which is translated into a polyprotein and cleaved by a combination of viral and host proteases to yield functional proteins. One of these, nonstructural protein 3 (NS3), is an enzyme with both serine protease and NTPase/helicase activities. NS3 plays a central role in the flavivirus life cycle: the NS3 N-terminal serine protease together with its essential cofactor NS2B is involved in the processing of the polyprotein, whereas the NS3 C-terminal NTPase/helicase is responsible for ATP-dependent RNA strand separation during replication. An unresolved question remains regarding why NS3 appears to encode two apparently disconnected functionalities within one protein. Here we report the 2.75-Å-resolution crystal structure of full-length Murray Valley encephalitis virus NS3 fused with the protease activation peptide of NS2B. The biochemical characterization of this construct suggests that the protease has little influence on the helicase activity and vice versa. This finding is in agreement with the structural data, revealing a single protein with two essentially segregated globular domains. Comparison of the structure with that of dengue virus type 4 NS2B-NS3 reveals a relative orientation of the two domains that is radically different between the two structures. Our analysis suggests that the relative domain-domain orientation in NS3 is highly variable and dictated by a flexible interdomain linker. The possible implications of this conformational flexibility for the function of NS3 are discussed.

TI  - Crystal Structure of the Dengue Virus Methyltransferase Bound to a 5′-Capped Octameric RNA
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 5
AB  - The N-terminal domain of the flavivirus NS5 protein functions as a methyltransferase (MTase). It sequentially methylates the N7 and 2′-O positions of the viral RNA cap structure (GpppA→7meGpppA→7meGpppA2′-O-me). The same NS5 domain could also have a guanylyltransferase activity (GTP+ppA-RNA→GpppA). The mechanism by which this protein domain catalyzes these three distinct functions is currently unknown. Here we report the crystallographic structure of DENV-3 MTase in complex with a 5′-capped RNA octamer (GpppAGAACCUG) at a resolution of 2.9 Å. Two RNA octamers arranged as kissing loops are encircled by four MTase monomers around a 2-fold non-crystallography symmetry axis. Only two of the four monomers make direct contact with the 5′ end of RNA. The RNA structure is stabilised by the formation of several intra and intermolecular base stacking and non-canonical base pairs. The structure may represent the product of guanylylation of the viral genome prior to the subsequent methylation events that require repositioning of the RNA substrate to reach to the methyl-donor sites. The crystal structure provides a structural explanation for the observed trans-complementation of MTases with different methylation defects.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81

EP  - 4765
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue fever, a neglected emerging disease for which no vaccine or antiviral agents exist at present, is caused by dengue virus, a member of the Flavivirus genus, which includes several important human pathogens, such as yellow fever and West Nile viruses. The NS5 protein from dengue virus is bifunctional and contains 900 amino acids. The S-adenosyl methionine transferase activity resides within its N-terminal domain, and residues 270 to 900 form the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalytic domain. Viral replication begins with the synthesis of minus-strand RNA from the dengue virus positive-strand RNA genome, which is subsequently used as a template for synthesizing additional plus-strand RNA genomes. This essential function for the production of new viral particles is catalyzed by the NS5 RdRp. Here we present a high-throughput in vitro assay partly recapitulating this activity and the crystallographic structure of an enzymatically active fragment of the dengue virus RdRp refined at 1.85-Å resolution. The NS5 nuclear localization sequences, previously thought to fold into a separate domain, form an integral part of the polymerase subdomains. The structure also reveals the presence of two zinc ion binding motifs. In the absence of a template strand, a chain-terminating nucleoside analogue binds to the priming loop site. These results should inform and accelerate the structure-based design of antiviral compounds against dengue virus.

EP  - 183
AB  - ABSTRACT Several flaviviruses are important human pathogens, including dengue virus, a disease against which neither a vaccine nor specific antiviral therapies currently exist. During infection, the flavivirus RNA genome is translated into a polyprotein, which is cleaved into several components. Nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) carries out enzymatic reactions essential for viral replication, including proteolysis of the polyprotein through its serine protease N-terminal domain, with a segment of 40 residues from the NS2B protein acting as a cofactor. The ATPase/helicase domain is located at the C terminus of NS3. Atomic structures are available for these domains separately, but a molecular view of the full-length flavivirus NS3 polypeptide is still lacking. We report a crystallographic structure of a complete NS3 molecule fused to 18 residues of the NS2B cofactor at a resolution of 3.15 Å. The relative orientation between the protease and helicase domains is drastically different than the single-chain NS3-NS4A molecule from hepatitis C virus, which was caught in the act of cis cleavage at the NS3-NS4A junction. Here, the protease domain sits beneath the ATP binding site, giving the molecule an elongated shape. The domain arrangement found in the crystal structure fits nicely into an envelope determined ab initio using small-angle X-ray scattering experiments in solution, suggesting a stable molecular conformation. We propose that a basic patch located at the surface of the protease domain increases the affinity for nucleotides and could also participate in RNA binding, explaining the higher unwinding activity of the full-length enzyme compared to that of the isolated helicase domain.

TI  - Crystal structures of full length DENV4 NS2B-NS3 reveal the dynamic interaction between NS2B and NS3
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Flavivirus is a genus of emerging and re-emerging arboviruses which include many significant human pathogens. Non-structural protein 3 (NS3), a multifunctional protein with N-terminal protease and C-terminal helicase, is essential in viral replication. The NS3 protease together with NS2B cofactor is an attractive antiviral target. A construct with an artificial glycine linker connecting the NS2B cofactor and NS3 protease has been used for structural, biochemical and drug-screening studies. The effect of this linker on dynamics and enzymatic activity of the protease was studied by several biochemical and NMR methods but the findings remained inconclusive. Here, we designed constructs of NS2B cofactor joined to full length DENV4 NS3 in three different manners, namely bNS2B47NS3 (bivalent), eNS2B47NS3(enzymatically cleavable) and gNS2B47NS3 (glycine-rich G4SG4 linker). We report the first crystal structures of linked and unlinked full-length NS2B-NS3 enzyme in its free state and also in complex with Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI). These structures demonstrate that the NS2B-NS3 protease mainly adopts a closed conformation. BPTI binding is not essential to but favors the closed conformation by interacting with both NS2B and NS3. The artificial linker between NS2B and NS3 tends to induce the open conformation and interfere with the protease activity. This negative impact on the enzyme structure and function is restricted to the protease domain as the ATPase activities of these constructs are not affected.

AB  - Abstract Dengue is a significant global health problem. Even though a vaccine against dengue is now available, which is a notable achievement, its long-term protective efficacy against each of the 4 dengue virus serotypes remains to be definitively determined. Consequently, drugs directed at the viral targets or critical host mechanisms that can be used safely as prophylaxis or treatment to effectively ameliorate disease or reduce disease severity and fatalities are still needed to reduce the burden of dengue. This review will provide a brief account of the status of therapeutics research and development for dengue.

VL  - 6
AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease worldwide and affects approximately 2.5 billion people living in over 100 countries. Increasing geographic expansion of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (which transmit the virus) has made dengue a global health concern. There are currently no approved antivirals available to treat dengue, and the only approved vaccine used in some countries is limited to seropositive patients. Treatment of dengue, therefore, remains largely supportive to date; hence, research efforts are being intensified for the development of antivirals. The nonstructural proteins, 3 and 5 (NS3 and NS5), have been the major targets for dengue antiviral development due to their indispensable enzymatic and biological functions in the viral replication process. NS5 is the largest and most conserved nonstructural protein encoded by flaviviruses. Its multifunctionality makes it an attractive target for antiviral development, but research efforts have, this far, not resulted in the successful development of an antiviral targeting NS5. Increase in structural insights into the dengue NS5 protein will accelerate drug discovery efforts focused on NS5 as an antiviral target. In this review, we will give an overview of the current state of therapeutic development, with a focus on NS5 as a therapeutic target against dengue.

TI  - Cyclooxygenase‐2 facilitates dengue virus replication and serves as a potential target for developing antiviral agents
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is one of the important mediators of inflammation in response to viral infection, and it contributes to viral replication, for example, cytomegalovirus or hepatitis C virus replication. The role of COX-2 in dengue virus (DENV) replication remains unclear. In the present study, we observed an increased level of COX-2 in patients with dengue fever compared with healthy donors. Consistent with the clinical data, an elevated level of COX-2 expression was also observed in DENV-infected ICR suckling mice. Using cell-based experiments, we revealed that DENV-2 infection significantly induced COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in human hepatoma Huh-7 cells. The exogenous expression of COX-2 or PGE2 treatment dose-dependently enhanced DENV-2 replication. In contrast, COX-2 gene silencing and catalytic inhibition sufficiently suppressed DENV-2 replication. In an ICR suckling mouse model, we identified that the COX-2 inhibitor NS398 protected mice from succumbing to life-threatening DENV-2 infection. By using COX-2 promoter-based analysis and specific inhibitors against signaling molecules, we identified that NF-κB and MAPK/JNK are critical factors for DENV-2-induced COX-2 expression and viral replication. Altogether, our results reveal that COX-2 is an important factor for DENV replication and can serve as a potential target for developing therapeutic agents against DENV infection.

TI  - Cyclophilins and Their Roles in Hepatitis C Virus and Flavivirus Infections: Perspectives for Novel Antiviral Approaches
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 10
AB  - Cyclophilins are cellular peptidyl-prolyl isomerases that play an important role in viral infections, with demonstrated roles in the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and other viruses in the Flaviviridae family, such as dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Here, we discuss the roles of cyclophilins in HCV infection and provide a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying the requirement for cyclophilins during HCV replication. Notably, cyclophilin inhibitor therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing HCV replication in chronically infected patients. While the roles of cyclophilins are relatively well-understood for HCV infection, cyclophilins are more recently emerging as host factors for flavivirus infection as well, providing potential new therapeutic avenues for these viral infections which currently lack antiviral therapies. However, further studies are required to elucidate the roles of cyclophilins in flavivirus replication. Here, we review the current knowledge of the role of cyclophilins in HCV infection to provide a conceptual framework to understand how cyclophilins may contribute to other viral infections, such as DENV and YFV. Improved understanding of the roles of cyclophilins in viral infection may open perspectives for the development of cyclophilin inhibitors as effective antiviral therapeutics for HCV and related viruses.

TI  - Cyclosporine Inhibits Flavivirus Replication through Blocking the Interaction between Host Cyclophilins and Viral NS5 Protein
JF  - Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy
VL  - 53
SP  - 3226
EP  - 3235
AB  - ABSTRACT Although flaviviruses cause significant human diseases, no effective therapy is currently available. Host factors essential for viral replication are potential targets for antiviral development. Here we report that cyclophilins (CyPs), a family of cellular peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases), play a role in flavivirus replication. Huh-7.5 cells with knockdown of different isoforms of CyP were less efficient than parental cells in supporting flavivirus replication, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus, and yellow fever virus. The low viral replication in CyP A (CyPA) knockdown cells could be rescued by trans supplying of a wild-type CyPA but not by trans supplying of a mutant CyPA (defective in the PPIase activity), indicating that the isomerase activity of CyPA is critical for viral replication. Immunoprecipitation and biochemical pulldown analyses showed that CyPA interacts with WNV genomic RNA and viral NS5 protein in the replication complex. Furthermore, antiviral experiments demonstrated that cyclosporine (Cs; an 11-amino-acid cyclic peptide known to block the PPIase activity of CyPA) inhibits flavivirus replication in cell culture at nontoxic concentrations. Time-of-addition and transient replicon results indicated that Cs inhibits flavivirus at the step of viral RNA synthesis. Biochemical analysis showed that Cs directly blocks the interaction between CyPA and WNV NS5 protein. Our results suggest that host CyPA is a component of flavivirus replication complex and could be targeted for potential antiviral development.

TI  - Cysteine Disulfide Traps Reveal Distinct Conformational Ensembles in Dengue Virus NS2B-NS3 Protease.
JF  - Biochemistry
VL  - 58 6
SP  - 776
EP  - 787
AB  - The dengue virus protease (NS2B-NS3pro) plays a critical role in the dengue viral life cycle, making it an attractive drug target for dengue-related pathologies, including dengue hemorrhagic fever. A number of studies indicate that NS2B-NS3pro undergoes a transition between two widely different conformational states: an "open" (inactive) conformation and a "closed" (active) conformation. For the past several years, the equilibrium between these states and the resting conformation of NS2B-NS3pro have been debated, although a strong consensus is emerging. To investigate the importance of such conformational states, we developed versions of NS2B-NS3pro that allow us to trap the enzyme in various distinct conformations. Our data from these variants suggest that the enzymatic activity appears to be dependent on the movement of NS2B and may rely on the flexibility of the protease core. Locking the enzyme into the "closed" conformation dramatically increased activity, strongly suggesting that the "closed" conformation is the active conformation. The observed resting state of the enzyme depends largely on the construct used to express the NS2B-NS3pro complex. In an "unlinked" construct, in which the NS2B and NS3 regions exist as independent, co-expressed polypeptides, the enzyme rests predominantly in a "closed", active conformation. In contrast, in a "linked" construct, in which NS2B and NS3 are attached by a nine-amino acid linker, NS2B-NS3pro adopts a more relaxed, alternative conformation. Nevertheless, even the unlinked construct samples both the "closed" and other alternative conformations. Given our findings, and the more realistic resemblance of NS2B-NS3pro to the native enzyme, these data strongly suggest that studies should focus on the "unlinked" constructs moving forward. Additionally, the results from these studies provide a more detailed understanding of the various poses of the dengue virus NS2B-NS3 protease and should help guide future drug discovery efforts aimed at this enzyme.

EP  - 
AB  - Background: Dengue is a mosquito borne viral infection caused by one of the four serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV1-DENV4). The consequences of DENV infection range from asymptomatic condition, dengue fever (DF), or severe forms, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The host immune responses have been considered as the major factor responsible for dengue pathogenesis. In this study, the cytokine IL-12 is reviewed for its utility as potential biomarker of severe dengue disease. Methods: 120 children of paediatric age group with either dengue NS1 antigen or dengue IgM positive were included. Cases were classified as uncomplicated dengue (dengue without warning signs) and complicated dengue (dengue with warning signs and severe dengue). Clinical features and IL-12 (ELISA KIT) levels were analyzed in the study population. Results: Analysis of clinical features among the study groups revealed children with complicated dengue had persistent vomiting (95%), abdominal pain (80%), decreased urine output (50%), bleeding manifestations (83.3%), Hepatomegaly (70%) Haemoconcentration with concurrent thrombocytopenia (93.3%), altered coagulation profile (28.3%), ICU stay (54.7%), leukocytosis (15%), leucopoenia (66.6%) normal leucocytes, (18.4%). Analysis of IL-12 levels revealed children with complicated dengue showed significant elevation compared to controls and uncomplicated dengue. Conclusions: In our study IL-12 levels were significantly higher in complicated dengue patients in comparison with uncomplicated dengue patients as well as normal control population.

TI  - Cytokine Signature of Dengue Patients at Different Severity of the Disease
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 22
AB  - Clinical presentations of dengue fever (DF) are diverse and non-specific, causing unpredictable progression and outcomes. Its progression and severity have been associated with cytokine levels alteration. In this study, dengue patients were classified into groups following the 2009 WHO dengue classification scheme to investigate the cytokine signature at different severity of the disease: dengue without warning sign symptoms (A); dengue with warning signs (B); severe dengue (C); other fever (OF) and healthy (Healthy). We analyzed 23 different cytokines simultaneously, namely IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IL-33, CD14, CD54, CD62E, CD62L, CD62p, CD106, CD121b, CD154, CD178, GM-CSF, IFN-g, MIF, ST2 and TNF from patients admitted to National Cheng Kung University Hospital during the 2015 Taiwan dengue outbreak. Cytokines TNF, CD54, CD62E, CD62L, CD62P, GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, INF-g and MIF were elevated while CD106, CD154, IL-4 and L-33 were decreased when compared to the control. IL-10 demonstrated to be a potential diagnostic marker for DF (H and A group; AUC = 0.944, H and OF group; AUC = 0.969). CD121b demonstrated to be predictive of the SD (A and B group; AUC = 0.744, B and C group; AUC = 0.775). Our results demonstrate the cytokine profile changes during the progression of dengue and highlight possible biomarkers for optimizing effective intervention strategies.

TI  - Cytoplasmic retention of dengue virus capsid protein by metformin impairing nuclear transport
JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 106
AB  - Abstract Nuclear transport of proteins larger than 60 kDa occurs via energy-dependent active transport, whereas smaller proteins diffuse into the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes via passive nuclear transport. Although the dengue virus (DENV) replication cycle primarily takes place in the cytoplasm, the capsid protein and non-structural protein 5 (NS5) are imported into the nucleus through a nuclear localization sequence-dependent mechanism. However, given its small molecular weight (14 kDa), the DENV capsid protein may also enter the nucleus via passive diffusion. While some drugs primarily inhibit active nuclear transport, few are known to block passive diffusion. Notably, biguanides have been associated with inhibitory effects on passive nuclear transport. Since biguanides such as metformin (MET) exhibit anti-DENV properties, we investigated the effects of MET on the nuclear transport of DENV proteins. Our results suggest that MET induces changes in the nuclear membrane of Huh-7 cells and reduces capsid nuclear localization without affecting NS5 nuclear import. Furthermore, MET treatment did not alter capsid nuclear import in BHK-21 cells. Additionally, mimicking MET’s effects using a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue increased capsid cytoplasmic retention and decreased DENV-2 replication. Finally, the inhibition of the classical active nuclear transport pathway did not block capsid nuclear transport, suggesting that DENV-2 capsid enters the nucleus in Huh-7 and Vero cells independently of this pathway.

TI  - Cytotoxic Factors Released by Dengue Virus‐Infected Human Blood Monocytes
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 46
AB  - Human monocyte‐derived cytotoxic factors (CF) induced by dengue virus were studied. Using several human leukemia cell lines as precursors, the biological activities of CF in conditioned medium from dengue virus‐infected monocytes were demonstrated through the measurement of tumor cell growth inhibition. The conditioned medium from dengue virus infected monocytes suppressed significantly growth of CEM, HL60, K562, and U937 cells. In the presence of 10% conditioned medium (v/v) from dengue virus infected monocytes, DNA synthesis of U937 cells, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, decreased by 99% in contrast to their synthesis in conditioned medium from noninfected control monocytes, which did not have any suppressive effect. Partial characterization of CF showed that it is a proteinase‐K‐sensitive and heat‐labile protein with a molecular mass over 100 kDa. Employing a flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle, it was found that U937 cells, treated either with conditioned medium from dengue virus infected monocytes or with CF, but not treated with conditioned medium from noninfected monocytes, showed cell‐cycle arrest in G1 phase by 48 hr. This suppressive effect of CF on U937 growth was dose‐ and time‐dependent. These results suggest that dengue virus‐infected monocytes may produce CF to target myeloid cells, resulting in the hematological changes observed in patients with dengue fever. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

JF  - FEMS immunology and medical microbiology
VL  - 30 3

EP  - 6
AB  - During dengue virus infection a unique cytokine, cytotoxic factor (hCF), is produced that is pathogenesis-related and plays a key role in the development of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). However, what regulates the adverse effects of hCF is not known. We have previously shown that anti-hCF antibodies raised in mice, neutralise the pathogenic effects of hCF. In this study we have investigated the presence and levels of hCF-autoantibodies in sera of patients with various severity of dengue illness (n=136) and normal healthy controls (n=50). The highest levels of hCF-autoantibodies (mean+/-S.D.=36+/-20 U ml(-1)) were seen in patients with mild illness, the dengue fever (DF), and 48 out of 50 (96%) of the sera were positive. On the other hand the hCF-autoantibody levels declined sharply with the development of DHF and the levels were lowest in patients with DHF grade IV (mean+/-S.D.=5+/-2 U ml(-1); P=<0.001 as compared to DF). Only one of the 13 DHF grade IV patients had an antibody level above the 'cut-off' value (mean plus 3 S.D. of the control sera). The analysis of data with respect to different days of illness further showed that the highest levels of hCF-autoantibodies were present in DF patients at >9 days of illness. Moreover, the DF patients at all time points, i.e. 1-4, 5-8 and >9 days of illness had significantly higher levels of hCF-autoantibodies (P<0.001) than patients with DHF grade I, II, III and IV. In addition DHF grade I and grade II patients had significantly more positive specimens than DHF grade III and grade IV patients at all time points. These results suggest that elevated levels of hCF-autoantibodies protect the patients against the development of severe forms of DHF and, therefore, it may be useful as a prognostic indicator.

TI  - DC-SIGN (CD209) Carbohydrate Recognition Domain Is Not Polymorphic in Dengue Virus-Infected Indonesian Patients
JF  - Tropical Medicine and Health
VL  - 43
SP  - 101
EP  - 105
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a significant burden in Indonesia and other tropical countries. DENV infection has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, i.e. asymptomatic, dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The variety of clinical manifestations may be due to the diversity of genetic constitution of the host. The C-type lectin DC-SIGN (CD209) has been identified as the major dengue receptor on human dendritic cells. There are at least five polymorphisms in exon 5 and 6 of the DC-SIGN encoded gene which have been identified and recorded in dbSNP. The aim of this work is to measure the frequency of these polymorphisms among asymptomatic and hospitalized DENV-infected patients. We enrolled 23 hospitalized and 73 asymptomatic DENV-infected patients. Among the subjects, we performed PCR amplification and DNA direct seqencing for 23 hospitalized DENV-infected patients and 24 asymptomatic DENV-infected patients. The result showed that there were no polymorphic nucleotides in the CD209 encoded gene among the patients.

TI  - DC-SIGN (CD209) Mediates Dengue Virus Infection of Human Dendritic Cells
JF  - The Journal of Experimental Medicine
VL  - 197
SP  - 823
EP  - 829
AB  - Dengue virus is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus that productively infects human dendritic cells (DCs) primarily at the immature stage of their differentiation. We now find that all four serotypes of dengue use DC-SIGN (CD209), a C-type lectin, to infect dendritic cells. THP-1 cells become susceptible to dengue infection after transfection of DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), or its homologue L-SIGN, whereas the infection of dendritic cells is blocked by anti–DC-SIGN antibodies and not by antibodies to other molecules on these cells. Viruses produced by dendritic cells are infectious for DC-SIGN– and L-SIGN–bearing THP-1 cells and other permissive cell lines. Therefore, DC-SIGN may be considered as a new target for designing therapies that block dengue infection.

TI  - DC-SIGN (CD209) Promoter −336 A/G Polymorphism Is Associated with Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Correlated to DC-SIGN Expression and Immune Augmentation
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 5
AB  - Background The C-type lectin DC-SIGN (CD209) is known to be the major dengue receptor on human dendritic cells, and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of CD209 (−336 A/G; rs4804803) is susceptible to many infectious diseases. We reason that variations in the DC-SIGN gene might have a broad influence on viral replication and host immune responses. Methods and Findings We studied whether the rs4804803 SNP was associated with a susceptibility to dengue fever (DF) and/or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) through genotyping analysis in a Taiwanese cohort. We generated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from individuals with AA or AG genotype of rs4804803 to study the viral replication and immune responses for functional validation. A total of 574 DNA samples were genotyped, including 176 DF, 135 DHF, 143 other non-dengue febrile illnesses (OFI) and 120 population controls. A strong association between GG/AG genotypes of rs4804803 and risk of DHF was found when compared among DF, OFI and controls (p = 0.004, 3×10−5 and 0.001, respectively). The AA genotype was associated with protection against dengue infection compared with OFI and controls (p = 0.002 and 0.020, respectively). Moreover, MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype with a higher cell surface DC-SIGN expression had a significantly higher TNFα, IL-12p40, and IP-10 production than those with AA genotype in response to dengue infection. However, the viral replication in MDDCs with AG genotype was significantly lower than those with AA genotype. With both genotypes, MDDCs revealed an increase in viral replication following the addition of anti-IP-10 neutralizing antibody. Conclusions/Significance The rs4804803 SNP in the CD209 promoter contributed to susceptibility to dengue infection and complication of DHF. This SNP with AG genotype affects the cell surface DC-SIGN expression related to immune augmentation and less viral replication.

TI  - DEAD-Box Helicase DDX25 Is a Negative Regulator of Type I Interferon Pathway and Facilitates RNA Virus Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 7
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that rapidly spread in tropic and subtropic area in recent years. DEAD (Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu)-box RNA helicases have been reported to play important roles in viral infection, either as cytosolic sensors of viral nucleic acids or as essential host factors for the replication of different viruses. In this study, we reported that DDX25, a DEAD-box RNA helicase, plays a proviral role in DENV infection. The expression levels of DDX25 mRNA and protein were upregulated in DENV infected cells. During DENV infection, the intracellular viral loads were significantly lower in DDX25 silenced cells and higher in DDX25 overexpressed cells. Meanwhile, the expression level of type I interferon (IFN) was increased in DDX25 siRNA treated cells during viral infection. Consistent with the in vitro findings, the Ddx25-transgenic mice have an increased susceptibility to lethal vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) virus challenge. The viremia was significantly higher while the anti-viral cytokine levels were lower in Ddx25-transgenic mice. Further, DDX25 modulated RIG-I signaling pathway and blocked IFNβ production, by interrupting IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NFκB activation. Thus, DDX25 is a novel negative regulator of IFN pathway and facilitates RNA virus infection.

TI  - DEAD-Box Helicase DDX3X as a Host Target against Emerging Viruses: New Insights for Medicinal Chemical Approaches.
JF  - Journal of medicinal chemistry
AB  - In recent years, globalization, global warming, and population aging have contributed to the spread of emerging viruses, such as coronaviruses (COVs), West Nile (WNV), Dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIKV). The number of reported infections is increasing, and considering the high viral mutation rate, it is conceivable that it will increase significantly in the coming years. The risk caused by viruses is now more evident due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the need to find new broad-spectrum antiviral agents able to tackle the present pandemic and future epidemics. DDX3X helicase is a host factor required for viral replication. Selective inhibitors have been identified and developed into broad-spectrum antivirals active against emerging pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 and most importantly against drug-resistant strains. This perspective describes the inhibitors identified in the last years, highlighting their therapeutic potential as innovative broad-spectrum antivirals.

TI  - DEAD-box RNA Helicase DDX3: Functional Properties and Development of DDX3 Inhibitors as Antiviral and Anticancer Drugs
JF  - Molecules
VL  - 25
AB  - This short review is focused on enzymatic properties of human ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3 and the development of antiviral and anticancer drugs targeting cellular helicases. DDX3 belongs to the DEAD-box proteins, a large family of RNA helicases that participate in all aspects of cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, innate immune response, viral replication, and tumorigenesis. DDX3 has a variety of functions in the life cycle of different viruses. DDX3 helicase is required to facilitate both the Rev-mediated export of unspliced/partially spliced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA from nucleus and Tat-dependent translation of viral genes. DDX3 silencing blocks the replication of HIV, HCV, and some other viruses. On the other hand, DDX displays antiviral effect against Dengue virus and hepatitis B virus through the stimulation of interferon beta production. The role of DDX3 in different types of cancer is rather controversial. DDX3 acts as an oncogene in one type of cancer, but demonstrates tumor suppressor properties in other types. The human DDX3 helicase is now considered as a new attractive target for the development of novel pharmaceutical drugs. The most interesting inhibitors of DDX3 helicase and the mechanisms of their actions as antiviral or anticancer drugs are discussed in this short review.

TI  - DENV Inhibits Type I IFN Production in Infected Cells by Cleaving Human STING
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a pathogen with a high impact on human health. It replicates in a wide range of cells involved in the immune response. To efficiently infect humans, DENV must evade or inhibit fundamental elements of the innate immune system, namely the type I interferon response. DENV circumvents the host immune response by expressing proteins that antagonize the cellular innate immunity. We have recently documented the inhibition of type I IFN production by the proteolytic activity of DENV NS2B3 protease complex in human monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). In the present report we identify the human adaptor molecule STING as a target of the NS2B3 protease complex. We characterize the mechanism of inhibition of type I IFN production in primary human MDDCs by this viral factor. Using different human and mouse primary cells lacking STING, we show enhanced DENV replication. Conversely, mutated versions of STING that cannot be cleaved by the DENV NS2B3 protease induced higher levels of type I IFN after infection with DENV. Additionally, we show that DENV NS2B3 is not able to degrade the mouse version of STING, a phenomenon that severely restricts the replication of DENV in mouse cells, suggesting that STING plays a key role in the inhibition of DENV infection and spread in mice.

TI  - DENV NS1 and MMP-9 cooperate to induce vascular leakage by altering endothelial cell adhesion and tight junction
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 17
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that causes a spectrum of diseases including life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Vascular leakage is a common clinical crisis in DHF/DSS patients which is closely associated with increased endothelial permeability. The presence of vascular leakage causes hypotension, circulatory failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation as the disease progresses, which can lead to death under such conditions. However, the mechanisms by which DENV infection caused the vascular leakage are not fully understood. This study reveals a distinct mechanism by which DENV induces endothelial permeability and vascular leakage in human endothelial cells and mice tissues. We initially show that DENV2 promotes the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression and secretion in DHF patient serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophages, and further reveal that DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) induces MMP-9 expression through activating the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Additionally, NS1 inhibits TIMP-1 expression to facilitates the MMP-9 enzymatic activity which alters the adhesion and tight junctions and vascular leakage in human endothelial cells and mouse tissues. Moreover, NS1 recruits MMP-9 to interact with β-catenin and Zona occludins protein-1/2 to degrade the important adhesion and tight junction proteins, thereby inducing endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leakage in human endothelial cells and mouse tissues. Thus, we reveal that DENV NS1 and MMP-9 cooperatively induce vascular leakage by impairing endothelial cell adhesion and tight junction, and suggest that MMP-9 may serve as a potential target for the treatment of hypovolemia in DSS/DHF patients. Author Summary DENV is the most common mosquito-transmitted viral pathogen in humans. In general, DENV-infected patients are either asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms with fever and rash. However, in severe cases of DENV infection, the disease may progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in school-age children in tropical and subtropical regions. DENV-induced vascular leakage is characterized by enhanced vascular permeability without morphological damage to the capillary endothelium. We found that a distinct mechanism of DENV NS1 and MMP-9 cooperatively induce vascular leakage is the main reason leading to death in severe dengue patients. Also, NS1 recruits MMP-9 to degrade β-catenin, ZO-1, ZO-2 to intervene endothelial hyperpermeability in human endothelial cells and mouse vascular. Finally, we reveal that DENV activating NF-κB signaling pathway induces MMP-9 expression, in patients, mice, PBMC and macrophages though the viral NS1 protein. This study would provide new in signs into the pathogenesis caused by DENV infection, and suggest that MMP-9 may acts as a drug target for the prevention and treatment of DENV-associated diseases.

TI  - DENV up-regulates the HMG-CoA reductase activity through the impairment of AMPK phosphorylation: A potential antiviral target
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease in humans. Changes of lipid-related metabolites in endoplasmic reticulum of dengue virus (DENV) infected cells have been associated with replicative complexes formation. Previously, we reported that DENV infection inhibits HMGCR phosphorylation generating a cholesterol-enriched cellular environment in order to favor viral replication. In this work, using enzymatic assays, ELISA, and WB we found a significant higher activity of HMGCR in DENV infected cells, associated with the inactivation of AMPK. AMPK activation by metformin declined the HMGCR activity suggesting that AMPK inactivation mediates the enhanced activity of HMGCR. A reduction on AMPK phosphorylation activity was observed in DENV infected cells at 12 and 24 hpi. HMGCR and cholesterol co-localized with viral proteins NS3, NS4A and E, suggesting a role for HMGCR and AMPK activity in the formation of DENV replicative complexes. Furthermore, metformin and lovastatin (HMGCR inhibitor) altered this co-localization as well as replicative complexes formation supporting that active HMGCR is required for replicative complexes formation. In agreement, metformin prompted a significant dose-dependent antiviral effect in DENV infected cells, while compound C (AMPK inhibitor) augmented the viral genome copies and the percentage of infected cells. The PP2A activity, the main modulating phosphatase of HMGCR, was not affected by DENV infection. These data demonstrate that the elevated activity of HMGCR observed in DENV infected cells is mediated through AMPK inhibition and not by increase in PP2A activity. Interestingly, the inhibition of this phosphatase showed an antiviral effect in an HMGCR-independent manner. These results suggest that DENV infection increases HMGCR activity through AMPK inactivation leading to higher cholesterol levels in endoplasmic reticulum necessary for replicative complexes formation. This work provides new information about the mechanisms involved in host lipid metabolism during DENV replicative cycle and identifies new potential antiviral targets for DENV replication.

TI  - DENV-1 Infection of Macrophages Induces Pyroptosis and Causes Changes in MicroRNA Expression Profiles
JF  - Biomedicines
VL  - 12
AB  - Background: Dengue virus (DENV) is the most widespread mosquito-borne virus, which can cause dengue fever with mild symptoms, or progress to fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. As the main target cells of DENV, macrophages are responsible for the innate immune response against the virus. Methods: In this study, we investigated the role of pyroptosis in the pathogenic mechanism of dengue fever by examining the level of pyroptosis in DENV-1-infected macrophages and further screened differentially expressed microRNAs by high-throughput sequencing to predict microRNAs that could affect the pyroptosis of the macrophage. Results: Macrophages infected with DENV-1 were induced with decreased cell viability, decreased release of lactate dehydrogenase and IL-1β, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, cleavage of GSDMD to produce an N-terminal fragment bound to cell membrane, and finally induced macrophage pyroptosis. MicroRNA expression profiles were obtained by sequencing macrophages from all periods of DENV-1 infection and comparing with the negative control. Sixty-three microRNAs differentially expressed in both the early and later stages of infection were also identified. In particular, miR-223-3p, miR-148a-3p, miR-125a-5p, miR-146a-5p and miR-34a-5p were recognized as small molecules that may be involved in the regulation of inflammation. Conclusions: In summary, this study aimed to understand the pathogenic mechanism of DENV through relevant molecular mechanisms and provide new targets for dengue-specific therapy.

AB  - The global incidence of dengue fever has gradually increased in recent years, posing a serious threat to human health. In the absence of specific anti-dengue drugs, understanding the interaction of Dengue virus (DENV) with the host is essential for the development of effective therapeutic measures. Autophagy is often activated during DENV infection to promote viral replication, but the mechanism of how DENV's own proteins induce autophagy has not been clarified. In this study, we first preliminarily identified DENV-2 NS1 as the most likely viral protein for DENV-2-induced autophagy with the help of molecular docking techniques. Further experimental results confirmed that DENV-2 NS1 regulates DENV-2 infection of HUVEC-induced autophagy through the AMPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway. Mechanistically, DENV-2 NS1 mainly interacted with AMPK by means of its Wing structural domain, and NS1 bound to all three structural domains on the AMPKα subunit. Finally, the experimental results showed that DENV-2 NS1 promoted the interaction between LKB1 and AMPKα1 and thus activated AMPK by both increasing the expression of LKB1 and binding LKB1. In conclusion, the results of this study revealed that DENV-2 NS1 protein served as a platform for the interaction between AMPK and LKB1 after DENV-2 infection with HUVEC, and pulled AMPK and LKB1 together to form a complex. LKB1 to form a complex, promoting LKB1 action on the kinase structural domain of AMPKα1, which in turn promotes phosphorylation of the Thr172 site on the AMPK kinase structural domain and activates AMPK, thereby positively regulating the AMPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway and inducing autophagy. The present discovery improves our understanding of DENV-2-induced host autophagy and contributes to the development of anti-dengue drugs.

TI  - DENV2 Pseudoviral Particles with Unprocessed Capsid Protein Are Assembled and Infectious
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Proteolytic processing of flavivirus polyprotein is a uniquely controlled process. To date, the sequential cleavage of the capsid anchor sequence at the junction of C-PrM has been considered essential for the production of flaviviruses. In this study, we used two experimental approaches to show the effect of unprocessed capsid on the production and infectivity of dengue virus 2 (DENV2) pseudoviral particles. The results showed that (1) both mature and unprocessed capsids of DENV2 were equally efficient in the viral RNA packaging and also in the assembly of infective particles; (2) DENV2 variants, in which the viral and host mediated cleavage of Ca peptide were independent, produced significantly higher levels of infective particles. Overall, this study demonstrated that unlike other flaviviruses, DENV2 capsid does not require a cleavable Ca sequence, and the sequential cleavage is not an obligatory requirement for the morphogenesis of infective pseudoviral particles.

TI  - DNA-immunisation with dengue virus E protein domains I/II, but not domain III, enhances Zika, West Nile and Yellow Fever virus infection
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), the causative agent of dengue disease, is among the most important mosquito-borne pathogens worldwide. DENV is composed of four closely related serotypes and belongs to the Flaviviridae family alongside other important arthropod-borne viral pathogens such as Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Yellow Fever virus (YFV). After infection, the antibody response is mostly directed to the viral E glycoprotein which is composed of three structural domains named DI, DII and DIII that share variable degrees of homology among different viruses. Recent evidence supports a close serological interaction between ZIKV and DENV. The possibility of worse clinical outcomes as a consequence of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) due to cross-reactive antibodies with poor neutralisation activity is a matter of concern. We tested polyclonal sera from groups of female Balb/C mice vaccinated with DNA constructs expressing DI/DII, DIII or the whole sE from different DENV serotypes and compared their activity in terms of cross-reactivity, neutralisation of virus infection and ADE. Our results indicate that the polyclonal antibody responses against the whole sE protein are highly cross-reactive with strong ADE and poor neutralisation activities due to DI/DII immunodominance. Conversely, anti-DIII polyclonal antibodies are type-specific, with no ADE towards ZIKV, WNV and YFV, and strong neutralisation activity restricted only to DENV.

TI  - DNA-induced 2′3′-cGAMP enhances haplotype-specific human STING cleavage by dengue protease
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 117
SP  - 15947
EP  - 15954
AB  - Significance Dengue virus (DENV) antagonizes the DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway to subvert innate immunity, but how DENV protease-mediated human STING cleavage contributes to DENV pathogenesis remains obscure. Here, we found that STING haplotype frequency varies among different subhuman populations, and different haplotypes respond differently to DENV protease. The cleavage of a DENV protease-sensitive STING can be further enhanced by coculture with neighboring cells producing 2′3′-cGAMP, either by DNA transfection of cGAS or by reactivating Epstein–Barr virus from latent infection. Thus, DENV infection trims down human STING-mediated innate immunity in a haplotype-specific manner. The genetic background of host STING and bystander coinfection of pathogens triggering 2′3′-cGAMP production may be the missing link between STING cleavage and DENV pathogenesis. The cytosolic DNA sensor cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) synthesizes the noncanonical cyclic dinucleotide 2′3′-cGAMP to activate the adaptor protein stimulator of IFN genes (STING), thus awakening host immunity in response to DNA pathogen infection. However, dengue virus (DENV), an RNA virus without a DNA stage in its life cycle, also manipulates cGAS-STING–mediated innate immunity by proteolytic degradation of STING. Here, we found that the sensitivity of STING to DENV protease varied with different human STING haplotypes. Exogenous DNA further enhanced DENV protease’s ability to interact and cleave protease-sensitive STING. DNA-enhanced STING cleavage was reduced in cGAS-knockdown cells and triggered by the cGAS product 2′3′-cGAMP. The source of DNA may not be endogenous mitochondrial DNA but rather exogenous reactivated viral DNA. Cells producing 2′3′-cGAMP by overexpressing cGAS or with DNA virus reactivation enhanced STING cleavage in neighboring cells harboring DENV protease. DENV infection reduced host innate immunity in cells with the protease-sensitive STING haplotype, whose homozygote genotype frequency was found significantly reduced in Taiwanese people with dengue fever. Therefore, the human STING genetic background and DNA pathogen coinfection may be the missing links contributing to DENV pathogenesis.

TI  - De Novo DNA Synthesis in Aedes aegypti Midgut Cells as a Complementary Strategy to Limit Dengue Viral Replication
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 9
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main vector of Dengue Virus, carrying the virus during the whole mosquito life post-infection. Few mosquito fitness costs have been associated to the virus infection, thereby allowing for a swift dissemination. In order to diminish the mosquito population, public health agency use persistent chemicals with environmental impact for disease control. Most countries barely use biological controls, if at all. With the purpose of developing novel Dengue control strategies, a detailed understanding of the unexplored virus-vector interactions is urgently needed. Damage induced (through tissue injury or bacterial invasion) DNA duplication (endoreplication) has been described in insects during epithelial cells renewal. Here, we delved into the mosquito midgut tissue ability to synthesize DNA de novo; postulating that Dengue virus infection could trigger a protective endoreplication mechanism in some mosquito cells. We hypothesized that the Aedes aegypti orthologue of the Drosophila melanogaster hindsight gene (not previously annotated in Aedes aegypti transcriptome/genome) is part of the Delta-Notch pathway. The activation of this transcriptional cascade leads to genomic DNA endoreplication. The amplification of the genomic copies of specific genes ultimately limits the viral spreading during infection. Conversely, inhibiting DNA synthesis capacity, hence endoreplication, leads to a higher viral replication.

TI  - De Novo Synthesis of Negative-Strand RNA by Dengue Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase In Vitro: Nucleotide, Primer, and Template Parameters
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 77
SP  - 10730
EP  - 10730
AB  - By using a purified dengue virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a subgenomic 770-nucleotide RNA template, it was shown previously that the ratio of the de novo synthesis product to hairpin product formed was inversely proportional to increments of assay temperatures (20 to 40 degrees C). In this study, the components of the de novo preinitiation complex are defined as ATP, a high concentration of GTP (500 micro M), the polymerase, and the template RNA. Even when the 3'-terminal sequence of template RNA was mutated from -GGUUCU-3' to -GGUUUU-3', a high GTP concentration was required for de novo initiation, suggesting that high GTP concentration plays a conformational role. Furthermore, utilization of synthetic primers by the polymerase indicated that AGAA is the optimal primer whereas AG, AGA, and AGAACC were inefficient primers. Moreover, mutational analysis of the highly conserved 3'-terminal dinucleotide CU of the template RNA indicated that change of the 3'-terminal nucleotide from U to C reduced the efficiency about fivefold. The order of preference for the 3'-terminal nucleotide, from highest to lowest, is U, A - G, and C. However, change of the penultimate nucleotide from C to U did not affect the template activity. A model consistent with these results is that the active site of the polymerase switches from a "closed" form, catalyzing de novo initiation through synthesis of short primers, to an "open" form for elongation of a double-stranded template-primer.

VL  - 276

EP  - 39937
AB  - Replication of positive strand flaviviruses is mediated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP). To study replication of dengue virus (DEN), a flavivirus family member, an in vitro RdRP assay was established using cytoplasmic extracts of DEN-infected mosquito cells and viral subgenomic RNA templates containing 5′- and 3′-terminal regions (TRs). Evidence supported that an interaction between the TRs containing conserved stem-loop, cyclization motifs, and pseudoknot structural elements is required for RNA synthesis. Two RNA products, a template size and a hairpin, twice that of the template, were formed. To isolate the function of the viral RdRP (NS5) from that of other host or viral factors present in the cytoplasmic extracts, the NS5 protein was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. In this study, we show that the purified NS5 alone is sufficient for the synthesis of the two products and that the template-length RNA is the product of de novo initiation. Furthermore, the incubation temperature during initiation, but not elongation phase of RNA synthesis modulates the relative amounts of the hairpin and de novo RNA products. A model is proposed that a specific conformation of the viral polymerase and/or structure at the 3′ end of the template RNA is required for de novoinitiation.

TI  - De-glycosylated non-structural protein 1 enhances dengue virus clearance by limiting PD-L1/PD-1 mediated T cell apoptosis
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of dengue virus (DENV) contains two highly conserved N-glycosylation sites at positions 130 and 207 (N130 and N207). Intracellular NS1 monomers and homo-dimers participate in viral RNA replication within membrane-bound replication complexes. Soluble multimeric NS1 (sNS1) is secreted into the extracellular milieu and represents an important virulence factor for DENV through its ability to interfere with the host complement activation cascade and to induce vascular leakage. The role of the two N-glycans in NS1 biological activities, however, has not been carefully examined. Here, stable DENV2 mutants that lack glycan at either N sites of NS1 were engineered. We showed that the lack of glycans at either N site of NS1 did not impair viral replication nor viral output in both mosquito and mammalian cell lines. In contrast, while N130 de-glycosylated DENV displayed parental in vivo fitness in IFNAR-/- mice, the N207 de-glycosylated mutant was significantly attenuated as evidenced by 100% survival rate, which correlated with accelerated viral clearance in circulation. sNS1-depletion, sNS1 exogenous administration and co-infection experiments supported that N207 de-glycosylated NS1 exerted a dominant attenuating effect during in vivo infection. Bulk RNAseq, inflammatory cytokine profile, immune phenotyping of neutrophils and T cells, immune cell depletion and immune checkpoint blockade approaches led us to propose that N207 de-glycosylated NS1 limited CD8+ T cell apoptosis mediated by the PD-L1/PD-1 axis, thereby improving viral clearance efficacy. This work uncovers a novel immune evasion strategy where N207 glycans on NS1 prevent the protein from exerting immune modulation activity that would be detrimental to DENV.

TI  - Decoding dengue’s neurological assault: insights from single-cell CNS analysis in an immunocompromised mouse model
JF  - Journal of Neuroinflammation
VL  - 22
AB  - Background Dengue encephalitis, a severe neurological complication of dengue virus infection, is increasingly recognized for its rising incidence and significant public health burden. Despite its growing prevalence, the underlying mechanisms and effective therapeutic strategies remain poorly understood. Methods Cellular atlas of dengue encephalitis was determined by single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Viral load of dengue virus and the level of cytokines expression was detected by RT-qPCR. The target cells of dengue virus were verified by immunofluorescence. The cytotoxic effect of CD8+ T cell was determined by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, in vivo CD8+ T cell depletion, adoptive transfer and CCK-8-based cell viability assay. Axonal and synaptic reduction induced by dengue virus infection was demonstrated by RT-qPCR, Western blot, transmission electron microscope and immunofluorescence. Finally, motor and sensory functions of mice were detected by open field test and hot plate test, respectively. Results In this study, we utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing on brain tissues from a dengue-infected murine model to construct a comprehensive cellular atlas of dengue encephalitis. Our findings identify neurons, particularly inhibitory GABAergic subtypes, as the primary targets of dengue virus. Additionally, immune cell infiltration was observed, contributing to significant neurological damage. Comprehensive analyses of cell-cell communication, combined with CD8+ T cell depletion and transfer restoration experiments, have elucidated the critical role of CD8+ T cells in triggering encephalitis through their interaction with neurons. These cells infiltrate the brain from peripheral circulation, interact with neurons, and induce damage of synapse and axon, accompanied by neurological dysfunction. Conclusion We defined cellular atlas of dengue encephalitis in mouse model and identified the primary target neuron of dengue virus. In addition, we demonstrated the significant cytotoxic effect of CD8+ T cell, which leads to apoptosis of neuron and neurological dysfunction of mice. Our study provides a molecular and cellular framework for understanding dengue encephalitis through advanced sequencing technologies. The insights gained serve as a foundation for future investigations into its pathogenesis and the development of targeted therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Decreased Type I Interferon Production by Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Contributes to Severe Dengue
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 11
AB  - The clinical presentation of dengue virus (DENV) infection is variable. Severe complications mainly result from exacerbated immune responses. Type I interferons (IFN-I) are important in antiviral responses and form a crucial link between innate and adaptive immunity. Their contribution to host defense during DENV infection remains under-studied, as direct quantification of IFN-I is challenging. We combined ultra-sensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) digital ELISA with IFN-I gene expression to elucidate the role of IFN-I in a well-characterized cohort of hospitalized Cambodian children undergoing acute DENV infection. Higher concentrations of type I IFN proteins were observed in blood of DENV patients, compared to healthy donors, and correlated with viral load. Stratifying patients for disease severity, we found a decreased expression of IFN-I in patients with a more severe clinical outcome, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). This was seen in parallel to a correlation between low IFNα protein concentrations and decreased platelet counts. Type I IFNs concentrations were correlated to frequencies of plasmacytoid DCs, not DENV-infected myloid DCs and correlated inversely with neutralizing anti-DENV antibody titers. Hence, type I IFN produced in the acute phase of infection is associated with less severe outcome of dengue disease.

TI  - Defective Mitochondrial Quality Control during Dengue Infection Contributes to Disease Pathogenesis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - Many viruses target host cell mitochondria to create a microenvironment conducive to viral dissemination. Dengue virus also exploits host cell mitochondria to facilitate its viral life cycle. ABSTRACT Mitochondrial fitness is governed by mitochondrial quality control pathways comprising mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial-selective autophagy (mitophagy). Disruption of these processes has been implicated in many human diseases, including viral infections. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the effect of dengue infection on host mitochondrial homeostasis and its significance in dengue disease pathogenesis. Despite severe mitochondrial stress and injury, we observed that the pathways of mitochondrial quality control and mitochondrial biogenesis are paradoxically downregulated in dengue-infected human liver cells. This leads to the disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis and the onset of cellular injury and necrotic death in the infected cells. Interestingly, dengue promotes global autophagy but selectively disrupts mitochondrial-selective autophagy (mitophagy). Dengue downregulates the expression of PINK1 and Parkin, the two major proteins involved in tagging the damaged mitochondria for elimination through mitophagy. Mitophagy flux assays also suggest that Parkin-independent pathways of mitophagy are also inactive during dengue infection. Dengue infection also disrupts mitochondrial biogenesis by downregulating the master regulators PPARγ and PGC1α. Dengue-infected cells release mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs) such as mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol and extracellular milieu. Furthermore, the challenge of naive immune cells with culture supernatants from dengue-infected liver cells was sufficient to trigger proinflammatory signaling. In correlation with our in vitro observations, dengue patients have high levels of cell-free mitochondrial DNA in their blood in proportion to the degree of thrombocytopenia. Overall, our study shows how defective mitochondrial homeostasis in dengue-infected liver cells can drive dengue disease pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Many viruses target host cell mitochondria to create a microenvironment conducive to viral dissemination. Dengue virus also exploits host cell mitochondria to facilitate its viral life cycle. Dengue infection of liver cells leads to severe mitochondrial injury and inhibition of proteins that regulate mitochondrial quality control and biogenesis, thereby disrupting mitochondrial homeostasis. A defect in mitochondrial quality control leads to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and promotes cellular injury. This leads to the release of mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (mt-DAMPs) into the cell cytoplasm and extracellular milieu. These mt-DAMPs activate the naive immune cells and trigger proinflammatory signaling, leading to the release of cytokines and chemokines, which may trigger systemic inflammation and contribute to dengue disease pathogenesis. In correlation with this, we observed high levels of cell-free mitochondrial DNA in dengue patient blood. This study provides insight into how the disruption of mitochondrial quality control in dengue-infected cells can trigger inflammation and drive dengue disease pathogenesis.

JF  - Immunology
VL  - 154
AB  - In recent years, our understanding of the complex number of signals that need to be integrated between a diverse number of receptors present on natural killer (NK) cells and ligands present on target cells has improved. Here, we review the progress made in identifying interactions between dengue viral peptides presented on HLA Class 1 molecules with inhibitory and activating killer‐like immunoglobulin receptors on NK cells, direct interactions of viral proteins with NK cell receptors, the involvement of dengue virus‐specific antibodies in mediating antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity and the role of soluble factors in modulating NK cell responses. We discuss findings of NK cell activation early after natural dengue infection, and point to the role that NK cells may play in regulating both innate and adaptive immune responses, in the context of our new appreciation of interactions of dengue virus with specific NK cell receptors. With a number of flavivirus vaccine candidates in clinical trials, how NK cells respond to attenuated dengue virus and subunit protein vaccine candidates and shape adaptive immunity will need to be considered.

TI  - Deletion analysis of dengue virus type 4 nonstructural protein NS2B: identification of a domain required for NS2B-NS3 protease activity
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 67
SP  - 2034
EP  - 2042
AB  - Most proteolytic cleavages in the nonstructural protein (NS) region of the flavivirus polyprotein are effected by a virus-encoded protease composed of two viral proteins, NS2B and NS3. The N-terminal 180-amino-acid-region of NS3 includes sequences with homology to the active sites of serine proteases, and there is evidence that this portion of NS3 can mediate proteolytic cleavages. In contrast, nothing is known about required sequences in NS2B. We constructed a series of deletion mutations in the NS2B portion of plasmid pTM/NS2B-30% NS3, which expresses dengue virus type 4 (DEN4) cDNA encoding NS2B and the N-terminal 184 residues of NS3 from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Mutant or wild-type plasmids were transfected into cells that had been infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase, and the protease activities of the expressed polyproteins were assayed by examining the extent of self-cleavage at the NS2B-NS3 junction. The results identify a 40-amino-acid segment of NS2B (DEN4 amino acids 1396 to 1435) essential for protease activity. A hydrophobicity profile of DEN4 NS2B predicts this segment constitutes a hydrophilic domain surrounded by hydrophobic regions. Hydrophobicity profiles of the NS2B proteins of other flaviviruses show similar patterns. Amino acid sequence alignment of this domain of DEN4 NS2B with comparable regions of other proteins of flaviviruses indicates significant sequence conservation, especially at the N-terminal end. These observations suggest that the central hydrophilic domain of NS2B of these other flaviviruses will also prove to be essential for protease activity.

TI  - Deletion of the C-Terminal Region of Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1 (NS1) Abolishes Anti-NS1-Mediated Platelet Dysfunction and Bleeding Tendency1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 183
SP  - 1797
EP  - 1803
AB  - The mechanisms underlying dengue hemorrhagic disease are incompletely understood. We previously showed that anti-dengue virus (DV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) Abs cross-react with human platelets and inhibit platelet aggregation. Based on sequence homology alignment, the cross-reactive epitopes reside in the C-terminal region of DV NS1. In this study, we compared the effects of Abs against full-length DV NS1 and NS1 lacking the C-terminal aa 271 to 352 (designated ΔC NS1). Anti-ΔC NS1 Abs exhibited lower platelet binding activity than that of anti-full-length NS1. Anti-full-length NS1 but not anti-ΔC NS1 Abs inhibited platelet aggregation, which was shown to involve integrin αIIbβ3 inactivation. We found that the bleeding time in full-length NS1-hyperimmunized mice was longer than that in the normal control mice. By contrast, ΔC NS1-hyperimmunized mice showed a bleeding time similar to that of normal control mice. Passively administered anti-DV NS1, but not anti-ΔC NS1, Ab level decreased markedly in serum and this decrease was correlated with Ab binding to platelets. A transient platelet loss in the circulation was observed after anti-DV NS1, but not anti-ΔC NS1, Ab administration. In summary, platelet dysfunction and bleeding tendency are induced by anti-full-length DV NS1 but not by anti-ΔC NS1 Abs. These findings may be important not only for understanding dengue hemorrhagic disease pathogenesis but also for dengue vaccine development.

TI  - Delineating the Role of Aedes aegypti ABC Transporter Gene Family during Mosquito Development and Arboviral Infection via Transcriptome Analyses
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 10
AB  - Aedes aegypti acts as a vector for several arboviral diseases that impose a major socio-economic burden. Moreover, the absence of a vaccine against these diseases and drug resistance in mosquitoes necessitates the development of new control strategies for vector-borne diseases. ABC transporters that play a vital role in immunity and other cellular processes in different organisms may act as non-canonical immune molecules against arboviruses, however, their role in mosquito immunity remains unexplored. This study comprehensively analyzed various genetic features of putative ABC transporters and classified them into A-H subfamilies based on their evolutionary relationships. Existing RNA-sequencing data analysis indicated higher expression of cytosolic ABC transporter genes (E & F Subfamily) throughout the mosquito development, while members of other subfamilies exhibited tissue and time-specific expression. Furthermore, comparative gene expression analysis from the microarray dataset of mosquito infected with dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses revealed 31 commonly expressed ABC transporters suggesting a potentially conserved transcriptomic signature of arboviral infection. Among these, only a few transporters of ABCA, ABCC and ABCF subfamily were upregulated, while most were downregulated. This indicates the possible involvement of ABC transporters in mosquito immunity.

TI  - Demethylation profile of the TNF‐α promoter gene is associated with high expression of this cytokine in Dengue virus patients
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 88
AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod‐borne viral illness in humans. The overexpression of cytokines by Dengue virus (DENV) infected cells is associated with the most severe forms of the disease. Unmethylated CpG islands are related to a transcriptionally active structure, whereas methylated DNA recruits methyl‐binding proteins that inhibit gene expression. Several studies have described the importance of epigenetic events in the regulation and expression of many cytokines. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the methylation status of the IFN‐γ and TNF‐α promoters in DNA extracted from dengue infected patients using methylation‐specific polymerase chain reaction. A high frequency of demethylation was observed in the TNF‐α promoter of DENV infected patients when compared to non‐infected controls. The patients with an unmethylated profile showed higher expression of TNF‐α mRNA than patients with the methylated status. No difference was found in the methylation frequency between the two analyzed groups regarding the IFN‐γ promoter or in the expression of IFN‐γ transcripts. The present study provides the first association of TNF‐α promoter demethylation in DENV infected individuals and demonstrates a correlation between the methylation status of the region analyzed and the expression of TNF‐α transcripts in DENV infected patients.

TI  - Demonstration of binding of dengue virus envelope protein to target cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 70
SP  - 8765
EP  - 8772
AB  - The nature of the initial interaction of dengue virus with target cells and the extent to which this interaction defines tropism are unknown. Infection of some cells may involve antidengue antibody-mediated immune adherence to cells bearing immunoglobulin Fc receptors; however, this mechanism does not explain primary infection or the infection of cells without Fc receptors. We hypothesized that dengue virus envelope protein mediates initial binding to target cells. To test this hypothesis, a recombinant chimeric form of dengue type 2 virus envelope protein was used as a probe to investigate binding to the surfaces of potential target cells. Envelope protein was expressed amino terminal to the heavy-chain constant region of human immunoglobulin G containing the Fc receptor binding motif; the binding mediated by envelope determinants was distinguishable from the binding mediated by immunoglobulin Fc determinants. We found that the recombinant chimera bound to Vero, CHO, endothelial, and glial cells through envelope protein determinants and to monocytes and U937 cells by Fc-Fc receptor interactions. The highest level of binding was to Vero cells; binding was dose and time dependent and saturable. Examination of partial-length recombinant envelope proteins indicated that the binding motif was expressed between amino acids 281 and 423. Recombinant envelope protein inhibited infection of Vero cells by dengue virus, indicating the functional significance of the interaction of envelope protein and target cells in infectivity. These results suggest that envelope protein binding to a non-Fc receptor could explain the cell and tissue tropism of primary dengue virus infection.

AB  - Dengue viruses and other members of the Flaviviridae family are emerging human pathogens. Dengue is transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti female mosquitoes. Following infection through the bite, cells of the hematopoietic lineage, like dendritic cells, are the first targets of dengue virus infection. Dendritic cells (DCs) are key antigen presenting cells, sensing pathogens, processing and presenting the antigens to T lymphocytes, and triggering an adaptive immune response. Infection of DCs by dengue virus may induce apoptosis, impairing their ability to present antigens to T cells, and thereby contributing to dengue pathogenesis. This review focuses on general mechanisms by which dengue virus triggers apoptosis, and possible influence of DC-apoptosis on dengue disease severity.

JF  - Journal of Virology

EP  - 7299
AB  - ABSTRACT CD14+ interstitial cells reside beneath the epidermis of skin and mucosal tissue and may therefore play an important role in viral infections and the shaping of an antiviral immune response. However, in contrast to dendritic cells (DC) or blood monocytes, these antigen-presenting cells (APC) have not been well studied. We have previously described long-lived CD14+ cells generated from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors, which may represent model cells for interstitial CD14+ APC. Here, we show that these cells carry DC-SIGN and differentiate into immature DC in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. We have compared the CD14+ cells and the DC derived from these cells with respect to dengue virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Both cell types are permissive to dengue virus infection, but the CD14+ cells secrete the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 and no tumor necrosis factor alpha. Regarding HIV, the CD14+ cells are permissive to HIV-1, release higher p24 levels than the derived DC, and more efficiently activate HIV Pol-specific CD8+ memory T cells. The CD14+ DC precursors infected with either virus retain their DC differentiation potential. The results suggest that interstitial CD14+ APC may contribute to HIV-1 and dengue virus infection and the shaping of an antiviral immune response.

TI  - Dendritic Cell-specific Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 3-grabbing Non-integrin (DC-SIGN)-mediated Enhancement of Dengue Virus Infection Is Independent of DC-SIGN Internalization Signals*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 280
SP  - 23698
EP  - 23708
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans. In the natural infection, DV is introduced into human skin by an infected mosquito vector where it is believed to target immature dendritic cells (DCs) and Langerhans cells (LCs). We found that DV productively infects DCs but not LCs. We show here that the interactions between DV E protein, the sole mannosylated glycoprotein present on DV particles, and the C-type lectin dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) are essential for DV infection of DCs. Binding of mannosylated N-glycans on DV E protein to DC-SIGN triggers a rapid and efficient internalization of the viral glycoprotein. However, we observed that endocytosis-defective DC-SIGN molecules allow efficient DV replication, indicating that DC-SIGN endocytosis is dispensable for the internalization step in DV entry. Together, these results argue in favor of a mechanism by which DC-SIGN enhances DV entry and infection in cis. We propose that DC-SIGN concentrates mosquito-derived DV particles at the cell surface to allow efficient interaction with an as yet unidentified entry factor that is ultimately responsible for DV internalization and pH-dependent fusion into DCs.

TI  - Dendritic Cells in Dengue Virus Infection: Targets of Virus Replication and Mediators of Immunity
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 5
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are sentinels of the immune system and detect pathogens at sites of entry, such as the skin. In addition to the ability of DCs to control infections directly via their innate immune functions, DCs help to prime adaptive B- and T-cell responses by processing and presenting antigen in lymphoid tissues. Infected Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus mosquitoes transmit the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes to humans while probing for small blood vessels in the skin. DENV causes the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease in humans, yet no vaccine or specific therapeutic is currently licensed. Although primary DENV infection confers life-long protective immunity against re-infection with the same DENV serotype, secondary infection with a different DENV serotype can lead to increased disease severity via cross-reactive T-cells or enhancing antibodies. This review summarizes recent findings in humans and animal models about DENV infection of DCs, monocytes, and macrophages. We discuss the dual role of DCs as both targets of DENV replication and mediators of innate and adaptive immunity, and summarize immune evasion strategies whereby DENV impairs the function of infected DCs. We suggest that DCs play a key role in priming DENV-specific neutralizing or potentially harmful memory B- and T-cell responses, and that future DC-directed therapies may help induce protective memory responses and reduce dengue pathogenesis.

JF  - Virology
VL  - 193 2
SP  - 888
EP  - 99
AB  - Flavivirus genomic RNA is translated into a large polyprotein that is processed into structural and nonstructural proteins. The N-termini of several nonstructural proteins are produced by cleavage at dibasic sites by a two-component viral proteinase consisting of NS2B and NS3. NS3 contains a trypsin-like serine proteinase domain at its N-terminus, whereas the function of NS2B in proteolysis is yet to be determined. We have used an NS3-specific antiserum, under nondenaturing conditions, to demonstrate that NS2B and NS3 form a complex both in vitro and in vivo. The N-terminal 184 residues of NS3 are sufficient to form the complex with NS2B. The complex forms efficiently when the NS2B and NS3 are translated from two different mRNAs as well as when NS2B and NS3 are translated as a polyprotein from the same mRNA. A chimeric complex can be formed between yellow fever NS2B and a chimeric yellow fever-dengue 2 NS3. Using anti-NS3 antisera, we also found that a 50-kDa fragment of NS3, consisting of the N-terminal approximately 460 residues, is produced in infected mammalian cells. This fragment is not produced in infected mosquito cells, but will form in Triton X-100 lysates of mosquito cells. The cleavage of NS3 to form this fragment is catalyzed by the NS3 proteinase itself and proteolysis requires NS2B. Examination of the amino acid sequence of NS3 reveals a potential conserved cleavage site that resembles other sites cleaved by the NS3/NS2B proteinase; this site occurs within a conserved RNA helicase sequence motif. The importance of this alternatively processed form of NS3 and its role in the replication cycle of dengue virus remain to be determined.

AB  - During the 1981 dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) Cuban epidemic, bronchial asthma (BA) was frequently found as a personal or family antecedent in dengue hemorrhagic fever patients. Considering that antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) plays an important role in the etiopathogenic mechanism of DHF/DSS, we decide to study the Dengue 2 virus (D2V) capability of replication in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from asthmatic patients and healthy persons. In 90% of asthmatic patients and 53.8% of control group it was obtained PBL with a significant D2V enhancing activity (X2 p < 0.01). Power enhancement was higher in asthmatic group. This is the first in vitro study relating BA and the dengue 2 virus immuno enhancement. The results obtained support the role of BA as a risk factor for DHF/DSS as already described on epidemiological data.

AB  - Thrombocytopenia is frequently associated with dengue virus infection in humans. Although antiplatelet immunopathogenic processes have been implicated in the origin of dengue-associated thrombocytopenia, the effect of dengue viruses on megakaryocyte differentiation remains incompletely understood. In this study, we examined the effect of human dengue 2 virus isolates on the in vitro growth and differentiation of thrombopoietin-induced megakaryopoiesis of cord blood CD34+ cells. Dengue 2 viruses, but not Japanese encephalitis virus, showed a dose-dependent inhibition of CFU-Mk. Viral antigens could be detected by an immunohistochemical technique in 3-5% of the early megakaryocytic progenitors by the 5th postexposure day in liquid cultures with cell loss, increased annexin V binding and active caspase-3 expression. In summary, dengue 2 viruses can inhibit in vitro megakaryopoiesis, as well as infect and induce apoptotic cell death in a subpopulation of early megakaryocytic progenitors. These events might contribute towards the origin of thrombocytopenia in dengue disease.

TI  - Dengue 3 virus distribution in the mosquito Aedes aegyptl: an immunocytochemical study
JF  - Medical and Veterinary Entomology
VL  - 10
AB  - Abstract. The dissemination of dengue (DEN) 3 virus in parenterally infected female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes was studied imrnunocytochemically. Antigen was first detected in fat body cells near the thoracic site of virus inoculation. The intussuscepted foregut, salivary glands and nervous tissue were the first major tissues infected. Nervous tissue appeared to be the primary site of amplification. Muscles, tracheae, Malphigian tubules and the posterior midgut did not become infected. The only part of the reproductive system to be infected was the calyx (71% of specimens 16–22 days post‐infection) consistent with low rates of vertical transmission. After 7 days post‐inoculation the salivary glands of 100% of the specimens examined were infected. Virus dissemination was slow and the most common sequence of infection following intrathoracic inoculation was as follows: thoracic fat body, intussuscepted foregut, salivary glands, cardial epithelium, thoracic ganglion, brain, compound eye, anterior midgut, intermediate midgut/anterior abdominal ganglia, and calyx/hindgut/posterior abdominal ganglia. Fat body and intussuscepted foregut tissues lost infections after 16 days post‐inoculation.

TI  - Dengue Immunopathogenesis: A Crosstalk between Host and Viral Factors Leading to Disease: Part I - Dengue Virus Tropism, Host Innate Immune Responses, and Subversion of Antiviral Responses
JF  - Dengue Fever in a One Health Perspective
AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent emerging mosquito-borne viral disease, affecting more than 40% of the human population worldwide. Many symptomatic dengue virus (DENV) infections result in a relatively benign disease course known as dengue fever (DF). However, a small proportion of patients develop severe clinical manifestations, englobed in two main categories known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Secondary infection with any of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1, -2, -3, and -4) is a risk factor to develop severe forms of dengue disease. DSS is primarily characterized by sudden and abrupt endothelial dysfunction, resulting in vascular leak and organ impairment, which may progress to hypovolemic shock and death. Severe DENV disease (DHF/DSS) is thought to follow a complex relationship between distinct immunopathogenic processes involving host and viral factors, such as the serotype cross-reactive antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), the activation of T cells and complement pathways, the phenomenon of the cytokine storm, and the newly described viral toxin activity of the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), which together play critical roles in inducing vascular leak and virus pathogenesis. In this chapter that is divided in two parts, we will outline the recent advances in our understanding of DENV pathogenesis, highlighting key viral-host interactions and discussing how these interactions may contribute to DENV immunopathology and the development of vascular leak, a hallmark of severe dengue. Part I will address the general features of the DENV complex, including the virus structure and genome, epidemiology, and clinical outcomes, followed by an updated review of the literature describing the host innate immune strategies as well as the viral mechanisms acting against and in favor of the DENV replication cycle and infection.

TI  - Dengue NS1 antigen contributes to disease severity by inducing interleukin (IL)‐10 by monocytes
JF  - Clinical & Experimental Immunology
VL  - 184
AB  - Both dengue NS1 antigen and serum interleukin (IL)‐10 levels have been shown to associate with severe clinical disease in acute dengue infection, and IL‐10 has also been shown to suppress dengue‐specific T cell responses. Therefore, we proceeded to investigate the mechanisms by which dengue NS1 contributes to disease pathogenesis and if it is associated with altered IL‐10 production. Serum IL‐10 and dengue NS1 antigen levels were assessed serially in 36 adult Sri Lankan individuals with acute dengue infection. We found that the serum IL‐10 levels correlated positively with dengue NS1 antigen levels (Spearman's r = 0·47, P < 0·0001), and NS1 also correlated with annexin V expression by T cells in acute dengue (Spearman's r = 0·63, P = 0·001). However, NS1 levels did not associate with the functionality of T cell responses or with expression of co‐stimulatory molecules. Therefore, we further assessed the effect of dengue NS1 on monocytes and T cells by co‐culturing primary monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), with varying concentrations of NS1 for up to 96 h. Monocytes co‐cultured with NS1 produced high levels of IL‐10, with the highest levels seen at 24 h, and then declined gradually. Therefore, our data show that dengue NS1 appears to contribute to pathogenesis of dengue infection by inducing IL‐10 production by monocytes.

TI  - Dengue NS1 interaction with lipids alters its pathogenic effects on monocyte derived macrophages
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 31
AB  - Background: While dengue NS1 antigen has been shown to be associated with disease pathogenesis in some studies, it has not been linked in other studies, with the reasons remaining unclear. NS1 antigen levels in acute dengue are often associated with increased disease severity, but there have been a wide variation in results based on past dengue infection and infecting dengue virus (DENV) serotype. As NS1 engages with many host lipids, we hypothesize that the type of NS1-lipid interactions alters its pathogenicity. Methods: Primary human monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) were co-cultured with NS1 alone or with HDL, LDL, LPS and/or platelet activating factor (PAF) from individuals with a history of past dengue fever (DF=8) or dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF=8). IL-1{beta} levels were measured in culture supernatants, and gene expression analysis carried out in MDMs. Monocyte subpopulations were assessed by flow cytometry. Hierarchical cluster analysis with Euclidean distance calculations were used to differentiate clusters. Differentially expressed variables were extracted and a classifier model was developed to differentiate between past DF and DHF. Results: Significantly higher levels of IL-1{beta} were seen in culture supernatants when NS1 was co-cultured with LDL (p=0.01), but with lower levels with HDL (p=0.05). MDMs of those past DHF produced more IL-1{beta} when NS1 with PAF (p=0.02). MDMs of individuals with past DHF, were significantly more likely to down-regulate RPLP2 gene expression when macrophages were co-cultured with either PAF alone, or NS1 combined with PAF, or NS1 combined with LDL. When NS1 was co-cultured with PAF, HDL or LDL two clusters were detected based on IL10 expression, but these did not differentiate those with past DF or DHF. Conclusions: As RPLP2 is important in DENV replication and in regulating cellular stress responses and immune responses and IL-10 is associated with severe disease, it would be important to further explore how differential expression of RPLP2 and IL-10 could lead to disease pathogenesis based on NS1 and lipid interactions.

TI  - Dengue NS3, an RNAi suppressor, modulates the human miRNA pathways through its interacting partner.
JF  - The Biochemical journal
VL  - 471 1
SP  - 89
EP  - 99
AB  - RNAi acts as a host immune response against non-self molecules, including viruses. Viruses evolved to neutralize this response by expressing suppressor proteins. In the present study, we investigated dengue virus non structural protein 3 (dvNS3), for its RNAi-suppressor activity in human cell lines. Dengue virus (DV) NS3 reverts the GFP expression in GFP-silenced cell lines. Pull-down assays of dvNS3 revealed that it interacts with the host factor human heat shock cognate 70 (hHSC70). Down-regulation of hHSC70 resulted in accumulation of dengue viral genomic RNA. Also, the interaction of dvNS3 with hHSC70 perturbs the formation of RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex)-loading complex (RLC), by displacing TRBP (TAR RNA-binding protein) and possibly impairing the downstream activity of miRNAs. Interestingly, some of these miRNAs have earlier been reported to be down-regulated upon DV infection in Huh7 cells. Further studies on the miRNA-mRNA relationship along with mRNA profiling of samples overexpressing dvNS3 revealed up-regulation of TAZ (tafazzin) and SYNGR1 (synaptogyrin 1), known dengue viral host factors (DVHFs). Importantly, overexpression of dvNS3 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells resulted in modulation of both mature and precursor miRNAs in human cell lines. Subsequent analysis suggested that dvNS3 induced stage-specific down-regulation of miRNAs. Taken together, these results suggest that dvNS3 affects biogenesis and function of host miRNAs to regulate DVHFs for favouring DV replication.

TI  - Dengue NS5 modulates expression of miR‐590 to regulate ubiquitin‐specific peptidase 42 in human microglia
JF  - FASEB bioAdvances
VL  - 1
SP  - 265
EP  - 278
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), a member of Flaviviridae family, has become neurovirulent in humans after rapid geographical expansion. Host proteasomal machinery contains both ubiquitin ligases as well as deubiquitinases (DUBs), known to influence key cellular and biological functions. MicroRNA‐mediated modulations of DUBs in case of DENV infections have not been explored yet. DENV propagation, MiRNA overexpression, miRNA knockdown, transfection, RT‐PCR, luciferase assay, and western blotting have been used in this study to establish the interaction of miR‐590 and USP42. DENV infection in human microglial cells resulted in downregulation of host DUB‐USP42 in a dose‐dependent manner and DENV‐NS5 gene alone was found to be sufficient for this downregulation. miR‐590 was upregulated upon NS5 overexpression in a dose‐dependent manner. Downregulation of USP42 was observed with miR‐590 overexpression. The specificity of this regulation was confirmed by miR‐590 mimic and anti‐miR transfections in microglial cells. miR‐590 overexpression and knockdown affected the expression level of TRAF6 in indirect manner in microglial cells. The luciferase assay demonstrated the direct regulatory interaction between miR‐590 and 3’UTR of USP42. These findings establish that DENV‐NS5 protein can potentially modulate the host deubiquitinase protein USP42 expression via altering cellular miR‐590 levels in human microglial cells.

TI  - Dengue Non-structural Protein 5 Polymerase Complexes With Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein (PML) Isoforms III and IV to Disrupt PML-Nuclear Bodies in Infected Cells
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 9
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) threatens almost 70% of the world's population, with no therapeutic currently available. The severe, potentially lethal forms of DENV disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome) are associated with the production of high level of cytokines, elicited as part of the host antiviral response, although the molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We previously showed that infection by DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) disrupts promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene product nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) after viral protein translation in infected cells. Apart from playing a key role as the nucleating agent in forming PML-NBs, PML has antiviral activity against various viruses, including DENV. The present study builds on this work, showing for the first time that all four DENV serotypes elicit PML-NB breakdown. Importantly, we show for the first time that of the nuclear localizing proteins of DENV, DENV non-structural protein (NS) 5 polymerase alone is sufficient to elicit PML-NB disassembly, in part through complexing with PML isoforms III and IV, but not other PML isoforms or other PML-NB components. The results raise the possibility that PML-NB disruption by nuclear localized NS5 contributes to DENV's suppression of the host antiviral response.

TI  - Dengue Nonstructural Protein 1 Maintains Autophagy through Retarding Caspase-Mediated Cleavage of Beclin-1
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 21
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a significant public health threat in tropical and subtropical regions; however, there is no specific antiviral drug. Accumulated studies have revealed that DENV infection induces several cellular responses, including autophagy and apoptosis. The crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis is associated with the interactions among components of these two pathways, such as apoptotic caspase-mediated cleavage of autophagy-related proteins. Here, we show that DENV-induced autophagy inhibits early cell apoptosis and hence enhances DENV replication. Later, the apoptotic activities are elevated to suppress autophagy through cleavage of Beclin-1, an essential autophagy-related protein. Inhibition of cleavage of Beclin-1 by a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD, increases both autophagy and viral replication. Regarding the mechanism, we further found that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is able to interact with Beclin-1 during DENV infection. The interaction between Beclin-1 and NS1 attenuates Beclin-1 cleavage and facilitates autophagy to prevent cell apoptosis. Our study suggests a novel mechanism whereby NS1 preserves Beclin-1 for maintaining autophagy to antagonize early cell apoptosis; however, elevated caspases trigger apoptosis by degrading Beclin-1 in the late stage of infection. These findings suggest implications for anti-DENV drug design.

JF  - Science Progress
VL  - 97
SP  - 197
EP  - 214
AB  - Dengue viruses cause mild disease in the majority of infected individuals. In most cases, the disease is characterised by fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle ache, joint pains, vomiting and diarrhoea. In a low percentage of patients, bleeding and loss of plasma (haemorrhage and plasma leakage) may occur. The hyper-permeability syndrome results in plasma leakage and, if the compensatory mechanisms of the body fail to control the plasma leakage or if medical intervention is late, shock may set in. Profound shock will subsequently lead to acidic blood (metabolic acidosis) and development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). During DIC multiple micro thromboses occur, leading to organ failure. The mechanisms governing pathogenesis of these forms of severe disease are not clear. High amounts of virus in the blood are believed to cause vascular fragility which, together with infection of endothelial cells and high levels of cytokines and other soluble mediators, may result in bleeding. In the absence of a correlation between the amount of virus in the blood and disease severity, it is likely that response to infection is an important cause of disease. The aberrant immune response to infection is believed to result in a cytokine storm, defined as an imbalance between cytokines driving an inflammation (pro-inflammatory) and those silencing an inflammation (anti-inflammatory). Several lines of evidence indicate that displacement of viral genotype and host genetic background are key factors driving the production of a cytokine storm. Several cytokines are known to induce apoptosis, a form of cell suicide (cause of haemorrhage), and/or affect adherens junctions (cause permeability) in vitro. Whether these cytokines may have such effects in vivo remains to be established.

TI  - Dengue Type 2 Virus Infection in Human Peripheral Blood Monocyte Cultures
JF  - Microbiology and Immunology
VL  - 28
AB  - Dengue type 2 virus (D2V) infection in cultured human monocytes was studied. D2V permissiveness of the monocytes was enhanced when the cells were inoculated with D2V in the presence of either polyclonal or type‐specific monoclonal anti‐dengue antibody. The enhancement of D2V permissiveness mediated by the antibodies was more clearly demonstrated when the monocytes had been treated with trypsin before virus inoculation, though treatment of the cells with trypsin alone decreased D2V permissiveness. The enhancement of infection by type‐specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody suggests that the D2V particles possess at least two antigenic determinants closely associated with virus infectivity.

TI  - Dengue Viral Protease Interaction with NF-κB Inhibitor α/β Results in Endothelial Cell Apoptosis and Hemorrhage Development
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 193
SP  - 1258
EP  - 1267
AB  - Hemorrhagic manifestations occur frequently accompanying a wide range of dengue disease syndromes. Much work has focused on the contribution of immune factors to the pathogenesis of hemorrhage, but how dengue virus (DENV) participates in the pathogenic process has never been explored. Although there is no consensus that apoptosis is the basis of vascular permeability in human dengue infections, we showed in dengue hemorrhage mouse model that endothelial cell apoptosis is important to hemorrhage development in mice. To explore the molecular basis of the contribution of DENV to endothelial cell death, we show in this study that DENV protease interacts with cellular IκBα and IκBβ and cleaves them. By inducing IκBα and IκBβ cleavage and IκB kinase activation, DENV protease activates NF-κB, which results in endothelial cell death. Intradermal inoculation of DENV protease packaged in adenovirus-associated virus-9 induces endothelial cell death and dermal hemorrhage in mice. Although the H51 activity site is not involved in the interaction between DENV protease and IκB-α/β, the enzymatic activity is critical to the ability of DENV protease to induce IκBα and IκBβ cleavage and trigger hemorrhage development. Moreover, overexpression of IκBα or IκBβ protects endothelial cells from DENV-induced apoptosis. In this study, we show that DENV protease participates in the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhage and discover IκBα and IκBβ to be the new cellular targets that are cleaved by DENV protease.

TI  - Dengue Virus 2 NS2B Targets MAVS and IKKε to Evade the Antiviral Innate Immune Response
JF  - Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology
VL  - 33
SP  - 600
EP  - 606
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a widespread arbovirus. To efficiently establish infection, DENV evolves multiple strategies to hijack the host innate immune response. Herein, we examined the inhibitory effects of DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) nonstructural proteins on RIG-I-directed antiviral immune response. We found that DENV2 NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B significantly inhibited RIG-I-mediated IFN-β promoter activation. The roles of NS2B in RIG-I-directed antiviral immune response are unknown. Our study further showed that NS2B could dose-dependently suppress RIG-I/MAVS-induced activation of IFN-β promoter. Consistently, NS2B significantly decreased RIG-I- and MAVS-induced transcription of IFNB1, ISG15, and ISG56. Mechanistically, NS2B was found to interact with MAVS and IKKε to impair RIG-I-directed antiviral response. Our findings demonstrated a previously uncharacterized function of NS2B in RIG-I-mediated antiviral response, making it a promising drug target for anti-DENV treatments.

TI  - Dengue Virus Activates Membrane TRAIL Relocalization and IFN-α Production by Human Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells In Vitro and In Vivo
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 7
AB  - Background Dengue displays a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations that may vary from asymptomatic to severe and even fatal features. Plasma leakage/hemorrhages can be caused by a cytokine storm induced by monocytes and dendritic cells during dengue virus (DENV) replication. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are innate immune cells and in response to virus exposure secrete IFN-α and express membrane TRAIL (mTRAIL). We aimed to characterize pDC activation in dengue patients and their function under DENV-2 stimulation in vitro. Methods & Findings Flow cytometry analysis (FCA) revealed that pDCs of mild dengue patients exhibit significantly higher frequencies of mTRAIL compared to severe cases or healthy controls. Plasma levels of IFN-α and soluble TRAIL are increased in mild compared to severe dengue patients, positively correlating with pDC activation. FCA experiments showed that in vitro exposure to DENV-2 induced mTRAIL expression on pDC. Furthermore, three dimension microscopy highlighted that TRAIL was relocalized from intracellular compartment to plasma membrane. Chloroquine treatment inhibited DENV-2-induced mTRAIL relocalization and IFN-α production by pDC. Endosomal viral degradation blockade by chloroquine allowed viral antigens detection inside pDCs. All those data are in favor of endocytosis pathway activation by DENV-2 in pDC. Coculture of pDC/DENV-2-infected monocytes revealed a dramatic decrease of antigen detection by FCA. This viral antigens reduction in monocytes was also observed after exogenous IFN-α treatment. Thus, pDC effect on viral load reduction was mainly dependent on IFN-α production Conclusions This investigation characterizes, during DENV-2 infection, activation of pDCs in vivo and their antiviral role in vitro. Thus, we propose TRAIL-expressing pDCs may have an important role in the outcome of disease.

TI  - Dengue Virus Activates the AMP Kinase-mTOR Axis To Stimulate a Proviral Lipophagy
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT Robust dengue virus (DENV) replication requires lipophagy, a selective autophagy that targets lipid droplets. The autophagic mobilization of lipids leads to increased β-oxidation in DENV-infected cells. The mechanism by which DENV induces lipophagy is unknown. Here, we show that infection with DENV activates the metabolic regulator 5′ adenosine-monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK), and that the silencing or pharmacological inhibition of AMPK activity decreases DENV replication and the induction of lipophagy. The activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) decreases in DENV-infected cells and is inversely correlated with lipophagy induction. Constitutive activation of mTORC1 by depletion of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) inhibits lipophagy induction in DENV-infected cells and decreases viral replication. While AMPK normally stimulates TSC2-dependent inactivation of mTORC1 signaling, mTORC1 inactivation is independent of AMPK activation during DENV infection. Thus, DENV stimulates and requires AMPK signaling as well as AMPK-independent suppression of mTORC1 activity for proviral lipophagy. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus alters host cell lipid metabolism to promote its infection. One mechanism for altered metabolism is the induction of a selective autophagy that targets lipid droplets, termed lipophagy. Lipophagy mobilizes lipid stores, resulting in enhanced β-oxidation and viral replication. We show here that DENV infection activates and requires the central metabolic regulator AMPK for its replication and the induction of lipophagy. This is required for the induction of lipophagy, but not basal autophagy, in DENV-infected cells.

TI  - Dengue Virus Alters Sialic Acid Residues Configuration in Macrophages
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The activation of the innate immune response requires sialic acid residues removal. Nevertheless, it is unknown the role for these changes during the Dengue virus infection. We determine if during Dengue virus infection, the sialic acid residues alter on the macrophages. The human monocytic cell line THP-1 was differentiated into macrophages and were infected with Dengue virus. The changes in sialic acid were evaluated by lectin blot in the cellular lysate. The activity of neuraminidase was defined by RT-PCR and fluorescence assays. Macrophages infection with DENV-2 reduces α-2,6 sialic acid residues at 24 h, and α-2,3 sialic acid residues lower at 48 h in some proteins. Transcriptional profile and enzymatic activities of Neu-1 showed a narrow decrease. Sialic acid residues oscillation in varied conformations and times suggest it a role of a selective mechanism to remove these residues. The lesser participation of Neu-1 in this process could be concomitant to other similar enzymes such as sialyl-transferases, or the phenomenon requires minimal activity to have a relevant biological function.

TI  - Dengue Virus Capsid Interacts with DDX3X–A Potential Mechanism for Suppression of Antiviral Functions in Dengue Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 7
AB  - Dengue virus is a pathogen of global concern and has a huge impact on public health system in low- and middle-income countries. The capsid protein of dengue virus is least conserved among related flavivirus and there is very limited information on the role of cytosolic proteins that interact with dengue virus capsid. We identified DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) Box Helicase 3, an X-Linked (DDX3X), cytosolic ATP-dependent RNA helicase as a dengue virus capsid-interacting protein. We show that the N-terminal region of capsid is important for interaction with DDX3X, while the N-terminal domain of DDX3X seems to be involved in interaction with dengue capsid. DDX3X was down-regulated in dengue virus infected cells at later stages of infection. Our results show that DDX3X is an antiviral protein as suppression of DDX3X expression by siRNA led to an increase in viral titers and overexpression of DDX3X led to inhibition of viral replication. Knock-down of DDX3X did not affect induction of type I interferon response upon infection suggesting that the effect of DDX3X knock-down is independent of the interferon-dependent pathways that DDX3X modulates under normal conditions. Thus, our study identifies DDX3X as a dengue virus capsid interacting protein and indicates a potential link between the antiviral functions of DDX3X and dengue capsid at later stages of dengue infection.

TI  - Dengue Virus Capsid Protein Binding to Hepatic Lipid Droplets (LD) Is Potassium Ion Dependent and Is Mediated by LD Surface Proteins
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 2096
EP  - 2108
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) affects millions of people, causing more than 20,000 deaths annually. No effective treatment for the disease caused by DENV infection is currently available, partially due to the lack of knowledge on the basic aspects of the viral life cycle, including the molecular basis of the interaction between viral components and cellular compartments. Here, we characterized the properties of the interaction between the DENV capsid (C) protein and hepatic lipid droplets (LDs), which was recently shown to be essential for the virus replication cycle. Zeta potential analysis revealed a negative surface charge of LDs, with an average surface charge of −19 mV. The titration of LDs with C protein led to an increase of the surface charge, which reached a plateau at +13.7 mV, suggesting that the viral protein-LD interaction exposes the protein cationic surface to the aqueous environment. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based force spectroscopy measurements were performed by using C protein-functionalized AFM tips. The C protein-LD interaction was found to be strong, with a single (un)binding force of 33.6 pN. This binding was dependent on high intracellular concentrations of potassium ions but not sodium. The inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase in DENV-infected cells resulted in the dissociation of C protein from LDs and a 50-fold inhibition of infectious virus production but not of RNA replication, indicating a biological relevance for the potassium-dependent interaction. Limited proteolysis of the LD surface impaired the C protein-LD interaction, and force measurements in the presence of specific antibodies indicated that perilipin 3 (TIP47) is the major DENV C protein ligand on the surface of LDs.

TI  - Dengue Virus Capsid Protein Binds Core Histones and Inhibits Nucleosome Formation in Human Liver Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 6
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the Flaviviridae and a globally (re)emerging pathogen that causes serious human disease. There is no specific antiviral or vaccine for dengue virus infection. Flavivirus capsid (C) is a structural protein responsible for gathering the viral RNA into a nucleocapsid that forms the core of a mature virus particle. Flaviviral replication is known to occur in the cytoplasm yet a large portion of capsid protein localizes to the nucleus during infection. The reasons for the nuclear presences of capsid are not completely understood. Here, we expressed mature DENV C in a tandem affinity purification assay to identify potential binding partners in human liver cells. DENV C targeted the four core histones, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. DENV C bound recombinant histones in solution and colocalized with histones in the nucleus and cytoplasm of liver cells during DENV infection. We show that DENV C acts as a histone mimic, forming heterodimers with core histones, binding DNA and disrupting nucleosome formation. We also demonstrate that DENV infection increases the amounts of core histones in livers cells, which may be a cellular response to C binding away the histone proteins. Infection with DENV additionally alters levels of H2A phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. The interactions of C and histones add an interesting new role for the presence of C in the nucleus during DENV infection.

TI  - Dengue Virus Capsid Protein Facilitates Genome Compaction and Packaging
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 24
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a single-stranded (+)-sense RNA virus that infects humans and mosquitoes, posing a significant health risk in tropical and subtropical regions. Mature virions are composed of an icosahedral shell of envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins circumscribing a lipid bilayer, which in turn contains a complex of the approximately 11 kb genomic RNA with capsid (C) proteins. Whereas the structure of the envelope is clearly defined, the structure of the packaged genome in complex with C proteins remains elusive. Here, we investigated the interactions of C proteins with viral RNA, in solution and inside mature virions, via footprinting and cross-linking experiments. We demonstrated that C protein interaction with DENV genomes saturates at an RNA:C protein ratio below 1:250. Moreover, we also showed that the length of the RNA genome interaction sites varies, in a multimodal distribution, consistent with the C protein binding to each RNA site mostly in singlets or pairs (and, in some instances, higher numbers). We showed that interaction sites are preferentially sites with low base pairing, as previously measured by 2′-acetylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) reactivity indicating structuredness. We found a clear association pattern emerged: RNA-C protein binding sites are strongly associated with long-range RNA–RNA interaction sites, particularly inside virions. This, in turn, explains the need for C protein in viral genome packaging: the protein has a chief role in coordinating these key interactions, promoting proper packaging of viral RNA. Such sites are, thus, highly consequential for viral assembly, and, as such, may be targeted in future drug development strategies against these and related viruses.

TI  - Dengue Virus Capsid Protein Usurps Lipid Droplets for Viral Particle Formation
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 5
AB  - Dengue virus is responsible for the highest rates of disease and mortality among the members of the Flavivirus genus. Dengue epidemics are still occurring around the world, indicating an urgent need of prophylactic vaccines and antivirals. In recent years, a great deal has been learned about the mechanisms of dengue virus genome amplification. However, little is known about the process by which the capsid protein recruits the viral genome during encapsidation. Here, we found that the mature capsid protein in the cytoplasm of dengue virus infected cells accumulates on the surface of ER-derived organelles named lipid droplets. Mutagenesis analysis using infectious dengue virus clones has identified specific hydrophobic amino acids, located in the center of the capsid protein, as key elements for lipid droplet association. Substitutions of amino acid L50 or L54 in the capsid protein disrupted lipid droplet targeting and impaired viral particle formation. We also report that dengue virus infection increases the number of lipid droplets per cell, suggesting a link between lipid droplet metabolism and viral replication. In this regard, we found that pharmacological manipulation of the amount of lipid droplets in the cell can be a means to control dengue virus replication. In addition, we developed a novel genetic system to dissociate cis-acting RNA replication elements from the capsid coding sequence. Using this system, we found that mislocalization of a mutated capsid protein decreased viral RNA amplification. We propose that lipid droplets play multiple roles during the viral life cycle; they could sequester the viral capsid protein early during infection and provide a scaffold for genome encapsidation.

TI  - Dengue Virus Co-opts UBR4 to Degrade STAT2 and Antagonize Type I Interferon Signaling
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 9
AB  - An estimated 50 million dengue virus (DENV) infections occur annually and more than forty percent of the human population is currently at risk of developing dengue fever (DF) or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Despite the prevalence and potential severity of DF and DHF, there are no approved vaccines or antiviral therapeutics available. An improved understanding of DENV immune evasion is pivotal for the rational development of anti-DENV therapeutics. Antagonism of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling is a crucial mechanism of DENV immune evasion. DENV NS5 protein inhibits IFN-I signaling by mediating proteasome-dependent STAT2 degradation. Only proteolytically-processed NS5 can efficiently mediate STAT2 degradation, though both unprocessed and processed NS5 bind STAT2. Here we identify UBR4, a 600-kDa member of the N-recognin family, as an interacting partner of DENV NS5 that preferentially binds to processed NS5. Our results also demonstrate that DENV NS5 bridges STAT2 and UBR4. Furthermore, we show that UBR4 promotes DENV-mediated STAT2 degradation, and most importantly, that UBR4 is necessary for efficient viral replication in IFN-I competent cells. Our data underscore the importance of NS5-mediated STAT2 degradation in DENV replication and identify UBR4 as a host protein that is specifically exploited by DENV to inhibit IFN-I signaling via STAT2 degradation.

AB  - The arthropod-borne diseases caused by dengue virus (DENV) are a major and emerging problem of public health worldwide. Infection with DENV causes a series of clinical manifestations ranging from mild flu syndrome to severe diseases that include hemorrhage and shock. It has been demonstrated that the innate immune response plays a key role in DENV pathogenesis. However, in recent years, it was shown that DENV evades the innate immune response by blocking type I interferon (IFN-I). It has been demonstrated that DENV can inhibit both the production and the signaling of IFN-I. The viral proteins, NS2A and NS3, inhibit IFN-I production by degrading cellular signaling molecules. In addition, the viral proteins, NS2A, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5, can inhibit IFN-I signaling by blocking the phosphorylation of the STAT1 and STAT2 molecules. Finally, NS5 mediates the degradation of STAT2 using the proteasome machinery. In this study, we briefly review the most recent insights regarding the IFN-I response to DENV infection and its implication for pathogenesis.

TI  - Dengue Virus Degrades USP33–ATF3 Axis via Extracellular Vesicles to Activate Human Microglial Cells
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 205
SP  - 1787
EP  - 1798
AB  - Key Points DENV infection modulates EV cargo to influence neighboring and distant cells. miR-148a transferred via EVs suppresses USP33/ATF3 axis in human microglia. Dengue virus (DENV) infection disrupts host innate immune signaling at various checkpoints. Cellular levels and stability of intermediate signaling molecules are a crucial hijacking point for a successful viral pathogenesis. Stability and turnover of all the cellular proteins including intermediate signaling molecules are principally regulated by proteasomal degradation pathway. In this study, we show that how DENV infection and particularly DENV-NS1 can modulate the host extracellular vesicle (EV) cargo to manipulate the deubiquitination machinery of the human microglial cell (CHME3). We have performed EV harvesting, size analysis by nanoparticle tracking analysis, identification of cargo microRNA via quantitative PCR, microRNA target validation by overexpression, and knockdown via mimics and anti-miRs, immunoblotting, dual luciferase reporter assay, in vivo ubiquitination assay, chase assay, and promoter activity assay to reach the conclusion. In this study, we show that DENV-infected monocytes and DENV-NS1–transfected cells release high amounts of EVs loaded with miR-148a. These EVs get internalized by human microglial cells, and miR-148a suppresses the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 33 (USP33) protein expression levels via binding to its 3′ untranslated region. Reduced USP33 in turn decreases the stability of cellular ATF3 protein via deubiquitylation. ATF3 acts as a suppressor of major proinflammatory gene expression pathways of TNF-α, NF-κB, and IFN-β. Our mechanistic model explains how DENV uses the EV pathway to transfer miR-148a for modulating USP33 and downstream ATF3 levels in human microglial cells and contributes in neuroinflammation within the CNS.

TI  - Dengue Virus Dysregulates Master Transcription Factors and PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathway in Megakaryocytes
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection can cause either self-limited dengue fever or hemorrhagic complications. Low platelet count is one of the manifestations of dengue fever. Megakaryocytes are the sole producers of platelets. However, the role of both host and viral factors in megakaryocyte development, maturation, and platelet production is largely unknown in DENV infection. PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays a significant role in cell survival, maturation, and megakaryocyte development. We were interested to check whether pathogenic insult can impact this pathway. We observed decreased expression of most of the major key molecules associated with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in DENV infected MEG-01 cells. In this study, the involvement of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in megakaryocyte development and maturation was confirmed with the use of specific inhibitors in infected MEG-01 cells. Our results showed that direct pharmacologic inhibition of this pathway greatly impacted megakaryopoiesis associated molecule CD61 and some essential transcription factors (GATA-1, GATA-2, and NF-E2). Additionally, we observed apoptosis in megakaryocytes due to DENV infection. Our results may suggest that DENV impairs PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis and molecules involved in the development and maturation of megakaryocytes. It is imperative to investigate the role of these molecules in the context of megakaryopoiesis during DENV infection to better understand the pathways and mechanisms, which in turn might provide insights into the development of antiviral strategies.

TI  - Dengue Virus Enhances Thrombomodulin and ICAM-1 Expression through the Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor Induction of the MAPK and PI3K Signaling Pathways
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) infections cause mild dengue fever (DF) or severe life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The mechanisms that cause hemorrhage in DV infections remain poorly understood. Thrombomodulin (TM) is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of vascular endothelial cells that plays an important role in the thrombin-mediated activation of protein C. Prior studies have shown that the serum levels of soluble TM (sTM) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) are significantly increased in DHF patients compared to levels in DF patients or normal controls. In this study, we investigated how MIF and sTM concentrations are enhanced in the plasma of DHF patients and the potential effect of MIF on coagulation through its influence on two factors: thrombomodulin (TM) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in endothelial cells and monocytes. Recombinant human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (rMIF) was used to treat monocytic THP-1 cells and endothelial HMEC-1 cells or primary HUVEC cells. The subsequent expression of TM and ICAM-1 was assessed by immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry analysis. Additionally, the co-incubation of THP-1 cells with various cell signaling pathway inhibitors was used to determine the pathways through which MIF mediated its effect. The data provided evidence that severe DV infections induce MIF expression, which in turn stimulates monocytes or endothelial cells to express TM and ICAM-1 via the Erk, JNK MAPK and the PI3K signaling pathways, supporting the idea that MIF may play an important role as a regulator of coagulation.

TI  - Dengue Virus Ensures Its Fusion in Late Endosomes Using Compartment-Specific Lipids
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 6
AB  - Many enveloped viruses invade cells via endocytosis and use different environmental factors as triggers for virus-endosome fusion that delivers viral genome into cytosol. Intriguingly, dengue virus (DEN), the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus that infects up to 100 million people each year, fuses only in late endosomes, while activation of DEN protein fusogen glycoprotein E is triggered already at pH characteristic for early endosomes. Are there any cofactors that time DEN fusion to virion entry into late endosomes? Here we show that DEN utilizes bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, a lipid specific to late endosomes, as a co-factor for its endosomal acidification-dependent fusion machinery. Effective virus fusion to plasma- and intracellular- membranes, as well as to protein-free liposomes, requires the target membrane to contain anionic lipids such as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate and phosphatidylserine. Anionic lipids act downstream of low-pH-dependent fusion stages and promote the advance from the earliest hemifusion intermediates to the fusion pore opening. To reach anionic lipid-enriched late endosomes, DEN travels through acidified early endosomes, but we found that low pH-dependent loss of fusogenic properties of DEN is relatively slow in the presence of anionic lipid-free target membranes. We propose that anionic lipid-dependence of DEN fusion machinery protects it against premature irreversible restructuring and inactivation and ensures viral fusion in late endosomes, where the virus encounters anionic lipids for the first time during entry. Currently there are neither vaccines nor effective therapies for DEN, and the essential role of the newly identified DEN-bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate interactions in viral genome escape from the endosome suggests a novel target for drug design.

TI  - Dengue Virus Entry and Replication Does Not Lead to Productive Infection in Platelets
JF  - Open Forum Infectious Diseases
VL  - 4
AB  - Abstract Thrombocytopenia is a characteristic feature during the acute phase of dengue infection and has been found to associate with vascular leakage in severe dengue. Although dengue antigens have been observed in platelets, there is no strong evidence to suggest a direct infection of platelets by dengue virus as a contributing factor for thrombocytopenia. We show that dengue virus can enter platelets but replicate viral ribonucleic acid to a minimal extent and, therefore, cannot produce infectious virus. Dengue antigen was undetectable in platelets isolated from dengue patients; however, we observed an increase in CD14+CD16+ monocyte-platelet complexes, suggesting a mechanism for platelet clearance.

TI  - Dengue Virus Entry as Target for Antiviral Therapy
JF  - Journal of Tropical Medicine
VL  - 2012
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infections are expanding worldwide and, because of the lack of a vaccine, the search for antiviral products is imperative. Four serotypes of DENV are described and they all cause a similar disease outcome. It would be interesting to develop an antiviral product that can interact with all four serotypes, prevent host cell infection and subsequent immune activation. DENV entry is thus an interesting target for antiviral therapy. DENV enters the host cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Several cellular receptors have been proposed, and DC-SIGN, present on dendritic cells, is considered as the most important DENV receptor until now. Because DENV entry is a target for antiviral therapy, various classes of compounds have been investigated to inhibit this process. In this paper, an overview is given of all the putative DENV receptors, and the most promising DENV entry inhibitors are discussed.

TI  - Dengue Virus Envelope Protein Domain III Induces Nlrp3 Inflammasome-Dependent NETosis-Mediated Inflammation in Mice
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - Abnormal immune responses and cytokine storm are involved in the development of severe dengue, a life-threatening disease with high mortality. Dengue virus-induced neutrophil NETosis response is associated with cytokine storm; while the role of viral factors on the elicitation of excessive inflammation mains unclear. Here we found that treatments of dengue virus envelope protein domain III (EIII), cellular binding moiety of virion, is sufficient to induce neutrophil NETosis processes in vitro and in vivo. Challenges of EIII in inflammasome Nlrp3−/− and Casp1−/− mutant mice resulted in less inflammation and NETosis responses, as compared to the wild type controls. Blockages of EIII-neutrophil interaction using cell-binding competitive inhibitor or selective Nlrp3 inflammasome inhibitors OLT1177 and Z-WHED-FMK can suppress EIII-induced NETosis response. These results collectively suggest that Nlrp3 inflammsome is a molecular target for treating dengue-elicited inflammatory pathogenesis.

TI  - Dengue Virus Genome Uncoating Requires Ubiquitination
JF  - mBio
VL  - 7
AB  - ABSTRACT The process of genome release or uncoating after viral entry is one of the least-studied steps in the flavivirus life cycle. Flaviviruses are mainly arthropod-borne viruses, including emerging and reemerging pathogens such as dengue, Zika, and West Nile viruses. Currently, dengue virus is one of the most significant human viral pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes and is responsible for about 390 million infections every year around the world. Here, we examined for the first time molecular aspects of dengue virus genome uncoating. We followed the fate of the capsid protein and RNA genome early during infection and found that capsid is degraded after viral internalization by the host ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, proteasome activity and capsid degradation were not necessary to free the genome for initial viral translation. Unexpectedly, genome uncoating was blocked by inhibiting ubiquitination. Using different assays to bypass entry and evaluate the first rounds of viral translation, a narrow window of time during infection that requires ubiquitination but not proteasome activity was identified. In this regard, ubiquitin E1-activating enzyme inhibition was sufficient to stabilize the incoming viral genome in the cytoplasm of infected cells, causing its retention in either endosomes or nucleocapsids. Our data support a model in which dengue virus genome uncoating requires a nondegradative ubiquitination step, providing new insights into this crucial but understudied viral process. IMPORTANCE Dengue is the most significant arthropod-borne viral infection in humans. Although the number of cases increases every year, there are no approved therapeutics available for the treatment of dengue infection, and many basic aspects of the viral biology remain elusive. After entry, the viral membrane must fuse with the endosomal membrane to deliver the viral genome into the cytoplasm for translation and replication. A great deal of information has been obtained in the last decade regarding molecular aspects of the fusion step, but little is known about the events that follow this process, which leads to viral RNA release from the nucleocapsid. Here, we investigated the fate of nucleocapsid components (capsid protein and viral genome) during the infection process and found that capsid is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, in contrast to that observed for other RNA and DNA viruses, dengue virus capsid degradation was not responsible for genome uncoating. Interestingly, we found that dengue virus genome release requires a nondegradative ubiquitination step. These results provide the first insights into dengue virus uncoating and present new opportunities for antiviral intervention.

TI  - Dengue Virus Glycosylation: What Do We Know?
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - In many infectious diseases caused by either viruses or bacteria, pathogen glycoproteins play important roles during the infection cycle, ranging from entry to successful intracellular replication and host immune evasion. Dengue is no exception. Dengue virus glycoproteins, envelope protein (E) and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) are two popular sub-unit vaccine candidates. E protein on the virion surface is the major target of neutralizing antibodies. NS1 which is secreted during DENV infection has been shown to induce a variety of host responses through its binding to several host factors. However, despite their critical role in disease and protection, the glycosylated variants of these two proteins and their biological importance have remained understudied. In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive summary of the current knowledge on protein glycosylation in DENV, and its role in virus biogenesis, host cell receptor interaction and disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Dengue Virus Hijacks a Noncanonical Oxidoreductase Function of a Cellular Oligosaccharyltransferase Complex
JF  - mBio
VL  - 8
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common arboviral infection globally, infecting an estimated 390 million people each year. We employed a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) screen to identify host dependency factors required for DENV propagation and identified the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex as an essential host factor for DENV infection. Mammalian cells express two OSTs containing either STT3A or STT3B. We found that the canonical catalytic function of the OSTs as oligosaccharyltransferases is not necessary for DENV infection, as cells expressing catalytically inactive STT3A or STT3B are able to support DENV propagation. However, the OST subunit MAGT1, which associates with STT3B, is also required for DENV propagation. MAGT1 expression requires STT3B, and a catalytically inactive STT3B also rescues MAGT1 expression, supporting the hypothesis that STT3B serves to stabilize MAGT1 in the context of DENV infection. We found that the oxidoreductase CXXC active site motif of MAGT1 was necessary for DENV propagation, as cells expressing an AXXA MAGT1 mutant were unable to support DENV infection. Interestingly, cells expressing single-cysteine CXXA or AXXC mutants of MAGT1 were able to support DENV propagation. Utilizing the engineered peroxidase APEX2, we demonstrate the close proximity between MAGT1 and NS1 or NS4B during DENV infection. These results reveal that the oxidoreductase activity of the STT3B-containing OST is necessary for DENV infection, which may guide the development of antiviral agents targeting DENV. IMPORTANCE The host oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complexes have been identified as essential host factors for dengue virus (DENV) replication; however, their functions during DENV infection are unclear. A previous study showed that the canonical OST activity was dispensable for DENV replication, suggesting that the OST complexes serve as scaffolds for DENV replication. However, our work demonstrates that one function of the OST complex during DENV infection is to provide oxidoreductase activity via the OST subunit MAGT1. We also show that MAGT1 associates with DENV NS1 and NS4B during viral infection, suggesting that these nonstructural proteins may be targets of MAGT1 oxidoreductase activity. These results provide insight into the cell biology of DENV infection, which may guide the development of antivirals against DENV.

TI  - Dengue Virus Impairs Mitochondrial Fusion by Cleaving Mitofusins
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - Mitochondria are highly dynamic subcellular organelles participating in many signaling pathways such as antiviral innate immunity and cell death cascades. Here we found that mitochondrial fusion was impaired in dengue virus (DENV) infected cells. Two mitofusins (MFN1 and MFN2), which mediate mitochondrial fusion and participate in the proper function of mitochondria, were cleaved by DENV protease NS2B3. By knockdown and overexpression approaches, these two MFNs showed diverse functions in DENV infection. MFN1 was required for efficient antiviral retinoic acid-inducible gene I–like receptor signaling to suppress DENV replication, while MFN2 participated in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) to attenuate DENV-induced cell death. Cleaving MFN1 and MFN2 by DENV protease suppressed mitochondrial fusion and deteriorated DENV-induced cytopathic effects through subverting interferon production and facilitating MMP disruption. Thus, MFNs participate in host defense against DENV infection by promoting the antiviral response and cell survival, and DENV regulates mitochondrial morphology by cleaving MFNs to manipulate the outcome of infection.

TI  - Dengue Virus Increases the Expression of TREM-1 and CD10 on Human Neutrophils.
JF  - Viral immunology
AB  - Every year, dengue is responsible for 400 million infections worldwide. Inflammation is related to the development of severe forms of dengue. Neutrophils are a heterogeneous cell population with a key role in the immune response. During viral infection, neutrophils are mainly recruited to the infection site; however, their excessive activation is linked to deleterious results. During dengue infection, neutrophils are involved in the pathogenesis through neutrophils extracellular traps production, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-8 secretion. However, other molecules regulate the neutrophil role during viral infection. TREM-1 is expressed on neutrophils and its activation is related to increased production of inflammatory mediators. CD10 is expressed on mature neutrophils and has been associated with the regulation of neutrophil migration and immunosuppression. However, the role of both molecules during viral infection is limited, particularly during dengue infection. Here, we report for the first time that DENV-2 can significantly increase TREM-1 and CD10 expression as well as sTREM-1 production in cultured human neutrophils. Furthermore, we observed that treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, a molecule mostly produced in severe cases of dengue, is capable of inducing the overexpression of TREM-1 and CD10 on human neutrophils. These results suggest the participation of neutrophil CD10 and TREM-1 in the pathogenesis of dengue infection.

TI  - Dengue Virus Induced COX-2 Signaling Is Regulated Through Nutrient Sensor GCN2
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 11
AB  - Nutrient sensor GCN2 plays a crucial role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis during the condition of amino acid deprivation. Dysfunction in the GCN2 signaling underlies several chronic metabolic diseases. Recent studies highlight the anti-viral potential of GCN2 against RNA viruses such as Sindbis and HIV. However, its effect on dengue virus (DENV) pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Herein, we report that GCN2 deficient cells show increased DENV replication and viral yield in the culture supernatants compared to WT cells infected with DENV. Notably, enhanced DENV replication in GCN2−/− cells is associated with increased COX-2/PGE2 signaling. Conversely, GCN2 overexpression/activation effectively contains DENV infection by inhibiting COX-2/PGE2 signaling. Mechanistically, deletion of GCN2 triggers enhanced production of COX-2/PGE2 through profound activation of Iκκ-NF-κB signaling pathway. Altogether our results unveil a hitherto unrecognized role of GCN2 in DENV pathogenesis, thereby suggesting that targeting the GCN2 pathway might offer a novel therapeutic intervention against DENV infection.

TI  - Dengue Virus Induces Expression of CXC Chemokine Ligand 10/IFN-γ-Inducible Protein 10, Which Competitively Inhibits Viral Binding to Cell Surface Heparan Sulfate1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 177
SP  - 3185
EP  - 3192
AB  - Dengue virus is an arthropod-borne flavivirus that causes a mild febrile illness, dengue fever, or a potentially fatal syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Chemokines primarily orchestrate leukocyte recruitment to the areas of viral infection, which makes them critical mediators of immune and inflammatory responses. In the present study, we investigated the induction and function of chemokines in mice early after infection with dengue virus in vivo. We found that CXCL10/IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) expression was rapidly and transiently induced in liver following infection. The expressed CXCL10/IP-10 likely mediates the recruitment of activated NK cells, given that anti-CXCL10/IP-10-treated mice showed diminished NK cell infiltration and reduced hepatic expression of effector molecules in activated NK cells after dengue virus infection. Of particular interest, we found that CXCL10/IP-10 also was able to inhibit viral binding to target cells in vitro. Further investigation revealed that various CXCL10/IP-10 mutants, in which the residues that mediate the interaction between the chemokine and heparan sulfate were substituted, failed to exert the inhibitory effect on dengue binding, which suggests that CXCL10/IP-10 competes with dengue virus for binding to heparan sulfate on the cell surface. Moreover, subsequent plaque assays showed that this inhibition of dengue binding blocked viral uptake and replication. The inhibitory effect of CXCL10/IP-10 on the binding of dengue virus to cells may represent a novel contribution of this chemokine to the host defense against viral infection.

TI  - Dengue Virus Induces and Requires Glycolysis for Optimal Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 2358
EP  - 2366
AB  - ABSTRACT Viruses rely on host cellular metabolism to provide the energy and biosynthetic building blocks required for their replication. Dengue virus (DENV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is one of the most important arthropod-borne human pathogens worldwide. We analyzed global intracellular metabolic changes associated with DENV infection of primary human cells. Our metabolic profiling data suggested that central carbon metabolism, particularly glycolysis, is strikingly altered during a time course of DENV infection. Glucose consumption is increased during DENV infection and depriving DENV-infected cells of exogenous glucose had a pronounced impact on viral replication. Furthermore, the expression of both glucose transporter 1 and hexokinase 2, the first enzyme of glycolysis, is upregulated in DENV-infected cells. Pharmacologically inhibiting the glycolytic pathway dramatically reduced DENV RNA synthesis and infectious virion production, revealing a requirement for glycolysis during DENV infection. Thus, these experiments suggest that DENV induces the glycolytic pathway to support efficient viral replication. This study raises the possibility that metabolic inhibitors, such as those that target glycolysis, could be used to treat DENV infection in the future. IMPORTANCE Approximately 400 million people are infected with dengue virus (DENV) annually, and more than one-third of the global population is at risk of infection. As there are currently no effective vaccines or specific antiviral therapies for DENV, we investigated the impact DENV has on the host cellular metabolome to identify metabolic pathways that are critical for the virus life cycle. We report an essential role for glycolysis during DENV infection. DENV activates the glycolytic pathway, and inhibition of glycolysis significantly blocks infectious DENV production. This study provides further evidence that viral metabolomic analyses can lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets to block the replication of medically important human pathogens.

TI  - Dengue Virus Induces the Expression and Release of Endocan from Endothelial Cells by an NS1–TLR4-Dependent Mechanism
JF  - Microorganisms
VL  - 9
AB  - A common hallmark of dengue infections is the dysfunction of the vascular endothelium induced by different biological mechanisms. In this paper, we studied the role of recombinant NS1 proteins representing the four dengue serotypes, and their role in promoting the expression and release of endocan, which is a highly specific biomarker of endothelial cell activation. We evaluated mRNA expression and the levels of endocan protein in vitro following the stimulation of HUVEC and HMEC-1 cell lines with recombinant NS1 proteins. NS1 proteins increase endocan mRNA expression 48 h post-activation in both endothelial cell lines. Endocan mRNA expression levels were higher in HUVEC and HMEC-1 cells stimulated with NS1 proteins than in non-stimulated cells (p < 0.05). A two-fold to three-fold increase in endocan protein release was observed after the stimulation of HUVECs or HMEC-1 cells with NS1 proteins compared with that in non-stimulated cells (p < 0.05). The blockade of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) signaling on HMEC-1 cells with an antagonistic antibody prevented NS1-dependent endocan production. Dengue-infected patients showed elevated serum endocan levels (≥30 ng/mL) during early dengue infection. High endocan serum levels were associated with laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, and are associated with the presence of NS1 in the serum.

The adhesion molecules they express, including P-selectin, CD40L, and CD42b, facilitate interactions with many cellular effectors. Upon interacting with a pathogen, platelets rapidly express and enhance their adhesion molecules, and secrete cytokines and chemokines. A similar phenomenon occurs after exposure of platelets to thrombin, an agonist extensively used for in vitro activation of these cells. It was recently reported that the dengue virus not only interacts with platelets but possibly infects them, which triggers an increased expression of adhesion molecule P-selectin as well as secretion of IL-1β. In the present study, surface molecules of platelets like CD40L, CD42b, CD62P, and MHC class I were evaluated at 4 h of interaction with dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2), finding that DENV-2 induced a sharp rise in the membrane expression of all these molecules. At 2 and 4 h of DENV-2 stimulation of platelets, a significantly greater secretion of soluble CD40L (sCD40L) was found (versus basal levels) as well as cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α. Compared to basal, DENV-2 elicited more than two-fold increase in these cytokines. Compared to the thrombin-induced response, the level generated by DENV-2 was much higher for GM-CSF, IL-6, and TNF-α. All these events induced by DENV end up in conspicuous morphological changes observed in platelets by confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, very different from those elicited by thrombin in a more physiological scenery.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infection Activates Interleukin-1β to Induce Tissue Injury and Vascular Leakage
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes several diseases ranging from dengue fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome characterized by endothelial dysfunction, vascular leakage, and shock. Here, we identify a potential mechanism by which DENV induces tissue injury and vascular leakage by promoting the activation of interleukin (IL)-1β. DENV facilitates IL-1β secretion in infected patients, mice, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), and monocyte-differentiated macrophages (THP-1) via activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. The accumulated data suggest that IL-1β probably induces vascular leakage and tissue injury in interferon-alpha/beta receptor 1 deficient C57BL/6 mice (IFNAR–/– C57BL/6), whereas IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) alleviates these effects of IL-1β. Finally, administration of recombinant IL-1β protein results in vascular leakage and tissue injury in C57BL/6 mice. Together, the accumulated results demonstrate that IL-1β contributes to DENV-associated pathology and suggest that IL-1RA acts as a potential agent for the treatment of DENV-associated diseases.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infection Alters Inter-Endothelial Junctions and Promotes Endothelial–Mesenchymal-Transition-like Changes in Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a pathogenic arbovirus that causes human disease. The most severe stage of the disease (severe dengue) is characterized by vascular leakage, hypovolemic shock, and organ failure. Endothelial dysfunction underlies these phenomena, but the causal mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction are poorly characterized. This study investigated the role of c-ABL kinase in DENV-induced endothelial dysfunction. Silencing c-ABL with artificial miRNA or targeting its catalytic activity with imatinib revealed that c-ABL is required for the early steps of DENV infection. DENV-2 infection and conditioned media from DENV-infected cells increased endothelial expression of c-ABL and CRKII phosphorylation, promoted expression of mesenchymal markers, e.g., vimentin and N-cadherin, and decreased the levels of endothelial-specific proteins, e.g., VE-cadherin and ZO-1. These effects were reverted by silencing or inhibiting c-ABL. As part of the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype, DENV infection and treatment with conditioned media from DENV-infected cells increased endothelial cell motility in a c-ABL-dependent manner. In conclusion, DENV infection promotes a c-ABL-dependent endothelial phenotypic change that leads to the loss of intercellular junctions and acquisition of motility.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infection Causes the Activation of Distinct NF-κB Pathways for Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase and TNF-α Expression in RAW264.7 Cells
JF  - Mediators of Inflammation
VL  - 2015
AB  - Infection with dengue virus (DENV) causes an increase in proinflammatory responses, such as nitric oxide (NO) generation and TNF-α expression; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this inflammatory activation remains undefined, although the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB is generally involved. In addition to TNF-α production in DENV-infected murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells, inducible NO synthase was transcriptionally and posttranslationally elevated and accompanied by NO generation. NF-κB is known to be activated by DENV infection. Pharmacologically inhibiting NF-κB activation abolishes iNOS/NO biosynthesis and TNF-α production. With inhibition, the potential role of NF-κB in oxidative signaling regulation was prevented during DENV infection. Heat-inactivated DENV failed to cause the identified inflammatory responses. Pharmacological inhibition of TLR3 partly decreased NF-κB activation; however, it effectively abolished inducible iNOS/NO biosynthesis but did not inhibit TNF-α production. In contrast to TLR3, viral protein NS2B3 also independently contributed to NF-κB activation to regulate TNF-α production. These results show the distinct pathways for NF-κB activation caused by DENV infection individually for the regulation of iNOS/NO and TNF-α expression.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infection In Mice Induces Bone Marrow Myeloid Cell Differentiation And Generates Ly6glow Immature Neutrophils With Modulated Functions.
JF  - Journal of leukocyte biology
AB  - While neutrophil activation during dengue virus (DV) infection is known, the effect of DV infection on neutrophil biogenesis has not been studied. We demonstrate that DV serotype-2 (DV2) induces the differentiation of mice progenitor cells ex vivo towards the CD11b + Ly6C + Ly6G+ granulocyte population. We further observed an expansion of CD11b + Ly6CintLy6Glow myeloid cells in the bone marrow of DV2-infected AG129 mice with low CXCR2 expression, implying immature population. Additionally, DV2 alone could induce the differentiation of promyelocyte cell line HL-60 into neutrophil-like cells (NLCs) as evidenced by increased expression of CD10, CD66b, CD16, CD11b, and CD62L, corroborating the preferential shift towards neutrophil differentiation by DV2 in the mouse model of dengue infection. The functional analysis showed that DV2-induced NLCs exhibited reduced phagocytic activity and enhanced NETosis as evidenced by the increased production of myeloperoxidase (MPO), citrullinated-Histones, extracellular DNA, and superoxide. These NLCs lose their ability to proliferate irreversibly and undergo arrest in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle. Further studies show that MPO-mediated signaling operating through the ROS axis may be involved in DV2-induced proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow cells as ABAH, an MPO inhibitor, limits cell proliferation in vitro and ex vi vo, affects the cell cycle, and reduces ROS production. Additionally, MPO inhibitor reduced NETosis and vascular leakage in DV2-infected AG129 mice. Our study thus provides evidence that DV2 can accelerate the differentiation of bone marrow progenitor cells into neutrophils through MPO and modulate their functions.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infection Induces Upregulation of GRP78, Which Acts To Chaperone Viral Antigen Production
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83
SP  - 12871
EP  - 12880
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) pathogenesis is related to the host responses to viral infection within target cells, and therefore, this study assessed intracellular changes in host proteins following DENV infection. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry identified upregulation of the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone GRP78 in K562 cells following DENV infection, in the absence of virus-induced cell death. Upregulation of GRP78 in DENV-infected cells was confirmed by immunostaining and confocal microscopy and by Western blot analysis and was also observed in DENV-infected primary monocyte-derived macrophages, a natural target cell type for DENV infection. GRP78 was upregulated in both DENV antigen-positive and -negative cells in the DENV-infected culture, suggesting a bystander effect, with the highest GRP78 levels coincident with high-level DENV antigen production and infectious-virus release. Transfection of target cells to express GRP78 prior to DENV challenge did not affect subsequent DENV infection, but cleavage of GRP78 with the SubAB toxin, during an established DENV infection, yielded a 10- to 100-fold decrease in infectious-virus release, loss of intracellular DENV particles, and a dramatic decrease in intracellular DENV antigen. However, DENV RNA levels were unchanged, indicating normal DENV RNA replication but altered DENV antigen levels in the absence of GRP78. Thus, GRP78 is upregulated by DENV infection and is necessary for DENV antigen production and/or accumulation. This may be a common requirement for viruses such as flaviviruses that depend heavily on the ER for coordinated protein production and processing.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infection Is through a Cooperative Interaction between a Mannose Receptor and CLEC5A on Macrophage as a Multivalent Hetero-Complex
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral pandemic disease that is widespread in the tropical and subtropical areas. Dengue virus uses human mannose-binding receptor (MR) and DC-SIGN on macrophages as primary receptors, and CLEC5A as signaling receptor to sense the dengue virus invasion and then to signal and stimulate macrophages to secrete cytokines. But the interplay between MR/DC-SIGN and CLEC5A is unknown. Here we demonstrate a plausible mechanism for the interaction, i.e. MR/DC-SIGN first attracts the virus with high avidity, and the virus concurrently interacts with CLEC5A in close proximity to form a multivalent hetero-complex and facilitate CLEC5A-mediated signal transduction. Our study suggests that the cooperation between a high-avidity lectin-virus interaction and a nearby low-avidity signaling receptor provides a necessary connection between binding and signaling. Understanding this mechanism may lead to the development of a new antiviral strategy.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infection Mediates HMGB1 Release from Monocytes Involving PCAF Acetylase Complex and Induces Vascular Leakage in Endothelial Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is released from cells as a pro-inflammatory cytokine in response to an injury or infection. During dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS), a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines are released, contributing to disease pathogenesis. In this study, the release of HMGB1 from human myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 and primary peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) cells was examined during dengue virus (DV)-infection. HMGB1 was shown to translocate from cell nuclei to the cytoplasm in both K562- and PBM-infected cells. The translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was shown to be mediated by the host cell p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetylase complex in K562 cells. In addition, DV capsid protein was observed to be the putative viral protein in actuating HMGB1 migration from the nucleus to cytoplasm through the involvement of PCAF acetylase. HMGB1 was released from DV-infected K562 cells into the extracellular milieu in a multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.)-independent manner and its release can be inhibited by the addition of 1–5 mM of ethyl pyruvate (EP) in a dose-dependent manner. Application of DV-infected K562 cell culture supernatants to primary endothelial cells induced vascular permeability. In contrast, supernatants from DV-infected K562 cells treated with EP or HMGB1 neutralizing antibody were observed to maintain the structural integrity of the vascular barrier.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infection Perturbs Lipid Homeostasis in Infected Mosquito Cells
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus causes ∼50–100 million infections per year and thus is considered one of the most aggressive arthropod-borne human pathogen worldwide. During its replication, dengue virus induces dramatic alterations in the intracellular membranes of infected cells. This phenomenon is observed both in human and vector-derived cells. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry of mosquito cells, we show that this membrane remodeling is directly linked to a unique lipid repertoire induced by dengue virus infection. Specifically, 15% of the metabolites detected were significantly different between DENV infected and uninfected cells while 85% of the metabolites detected were significantly different in isolated replication complex membranes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intracellular lipid redistribution induced by the inhibition of fatty acid synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in lipid biosynthesis, is sufficient for cell survival but is inhibitory to dengue virus replication. Lipids that have the capacity to destabilize and change the curvature of membranes as well as lipids that change the permeability of membranes are enriched in dengue virus infected cells. Several sphingolipids and other bioactive signaling molecules that are involved in controlling membrane fusion, fission, and trafficking as well as molecules that influence cytoskeletal reorganization are also up regulated during dengue infection. These observations shed light on the emerging role of lipids in shaping the membrane and protein environments during viral infections and suggest membrane-organizing principles that may influence virus-induced intracellular membrane architecture.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infection of Aedes aegypti Alters Extracellular Vesicle Protein Cargo to Enhance Virus Transmission
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 21
AB  - Dengue is the most burdensome vector-borne viral disease in the world. Dengue virus (DENV), the etiological cause of dengue, is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Like any arbovirus, the transmission cycle of dengue involves the complex interactions of a multitude of human and mosquito factors. One point during this transmission cycle that is rich in these interactions is the biting event by the mosquito, upon which its saliva is injected into the host. A number of components in mosquito saliva have been shown to play a pivotal role in the transmission of dengue, however one such component that is not as well characterized is extracellular vesicles. Here, using high-performance liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry, we show that dengue infection altered the protein cargo of Aedes aegypti extracellular vesicles, resulting in the packaging of proteins with infection-enhancing ability. Our results support the presence of an infection-dependent pro-viral protein packaging strategy that uses the differential packaging of pro-viral proteins in extracellular vesicles of Ae. aegypti saliva to promote transmission. These studies represent the first investigation into the function of Ae. aegypti extracellular vesicle cargo during dengue infection.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infection of Blood–Brain Barrier Cells: Consequences of Severe Disease
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - More than 500 million people worldwide are infected each year by any of the four-dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. The clinical spectrum caused during these infections is wide and some patients may develop neurological alterations during or after the infection, which could be explained by the cryptic neurotropic and neurovirulent features of flaviviruses like DENV. Using in vivo and in vitro models, researchers have demonstrated that DENV can affect the cells from the blood–brain barrier (BBB) in several ways, which could result in brain tissue damage, neuronal loss, glial activation, tissue inflammation and hemorrhages. The latter suggests that BBB may be compromised during infection; however, it is not clear whether the damage is due to the infection per se or to the local and/or systemic inflammatory response established or activated by the BBB cells. Similarly, the kinetics and cascade of events that trigger tissue damage, and the cells that initiate it, are unknown. This review presents evidence of the BBB cell infection with DENV and the response established toward it by these cells; it also describes the consequences of this response on the nervous tissue, compares these evidence with the one reported with neurotropic viruses of the Flaviviridae family, and shows the complexity and unpredictability of dengue and the neurological alterations induced by it. Clinical evidence and in vitro and in vivo models suggest that this virus uses the bloodstream to enter nerve tissue where it infects the different cells of the neurovascular unit. Each of the cell populations respond individually and collectively and control infection and inflammation, in other cases this response exacerbates the damage leaving irreversible sequelae or causing death. This information will allow us to understand more about the complex disease known as dengue, and its impact on a specialized and delicate tissue like is the nervous tissue.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infection of Human Retinal Müller Glial Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Retinopathy is a recently recognized complication of dengue, affecting up to 10% of hospitalized patients. Research on the pathogenesis has focused largely on effects of dengue virus (DENV) at the blood–retinal barrier. Involvement of retinal Müller glial cells has received little attention, although this cell population contributes to the pathology of other intraocular infections. The goal of our work was to establish the susceptibility of Müller cells to infection with DENV and to identify characteristics of the cellular antiviral, inflammatory, and immunomodulatory responses to DENV infection in vitro. Primary human Müller cell isolates and the MIO-M1 human Müller cell line were infected with the laboratory-adapted Mon601 strain and DENV serotype 1 and 2 field isolates, and cell–DENV interactions were investigated by immunolabelling and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Müller cells were susceptible to DENV infection, but experiments involving primary cell isolates indicated inter-individual variation. Viral infection induced an inflammatory response (including tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin [IL]-1β, and IL-6) and an immunomodulatory response (including programmed death-ligand [PD-L]1 and PD-L2). The type I interferon response was muted in the Müller cell line compared to primary cell isolates. The highest infectivity and cell responses were observed in the laboratory-adapted strain, and overall, infectivity and cell responses were stronger in DENV2 strains. This work demonstrates that Müller cells mount an antiviral and immune response to DENV infection, and that this response varies across cell isolates and DENV strain. The research provides a direction for future efforts to understand the role of human retinal Müller glial cells in dengue retinopathy.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85

EP  - 1150
AB  - ABSTRACT Vascular perturbation is a hallmark of severe forms of dengue disease. We show here that antibody-enhanced dengue virus infection of primary human cord blood-derived mast cells (CBMCs) and the human mast cell-like line HMC-1 results in the release of factor(s) which activate human endothelial cells, as evidenced by increased expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Endothelial cell activation was prevented by pretreatment of mast cell-derived supernatants with a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-specific blocking antibody, thus identifying TNF as the endothelial cell-activating factor. Our findings suggest that mast cells may represent an important source of TNF, promoting vascular endothelial perturbation following antibody-enhanced dengue virus infection.

AB  - Although endothelial cell (EC) infection is not widespread during dengue virus (DENV) infection in vivo, the endothelium is the site of the pathogenic effects seen in severe DENV disease. In this study, we investigated DENV infection of primary EC and defined factors that influence infection in this cell type. Consistent with in vivo findings where EC infection is infrequent, only 3%-15% of EC became productively DENV-2-infected in vitro. This low level infection could not be attributed to inhibition by heparin, EC donor variation, heterogeneity, or biological source. DENV-infection of EC was associated with induction of innate immune responses, including increased STAT1 protein, STAT1- phosphorylation, interferon (IFN)-β, OAS-1, IFIT-1/ISG56, and viperin mRNA. Antibody blocking of IFN-β inhibited the induction of OAS1, IFIT1/ISG56, and viperin while shRNA knockdown of viperin enhanced DENV-infection in EC. DENV-infection of EC resulted in increased activity of sphingosine kinase 1, a factor important in maintaining vascular integrity, and altered basal and stimulated changes in barrier integrity of DENV-infected EC monolayers. Thus, DENV productively infects only a small percentage of primary EC but this has a major influence on induction of IFN-β driven innate immune responses that can restrict infection while the EC themselves are functionally altered. These changes may have important consequences for the endothelium and are reflective of pathogenic changes associated with vascular leakage, as seen in DENV disease.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection of humans is presently the most important arthropod-borne viral global threat, for which no suitable or reliable animal model exists. Reports addressing the effect of DENV on vascular components other than endothelial cells are lacking. Dengue virus infection of vascular smooth muscle cells, which play a physiological compensatory response to hypotension in arteries and arterioles, has not been characterized, thus precluding our understanding of the role of these vascular components in dengue pathogenesis. Therefore, we studied the permissiveness of primary human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMC) to DENV 1-4 infection and compared with the infection in the previously reported primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the classically used, non-transformed, and highly permissive Lilly Laboratories Cell-Monkey Kidney 2 cells. Our results show that HUASMC are susceptible and productive to infection with the four DENV serotypes, although to a lesser extent when compared with the other cell lines. This is the first report of DENV permissiveness in human smooth muscle cells, which might represent an unexplored pathophysiological contributor to the vascular collapse observed in severe human dengue infection.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infection of the Aedes aegypti Salivary Gland and Chemosensory Apparatus Induces Genes that Modulate Infection and Blood-Feeding Behavior
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 8
AB  - The female Aedes aegypti salivary gland plays a pivotal role in bloodmeal acquisition and reproduction, and thereby dengue virus (DENV) transmission. It produces numerous immune factors, as well as immune-modulatory, vasodilatory, and anti-coagulant molecules that facilitate blood-feeding. To assess the impact of DENV infection on salivary gland physiology and function, we performed a comparative genome-wide microarray analysis of the naïve and DENV infection-responsive A. aegypti salivary gland transcriptomes. DENV infection resulted in the regulation of 147 transcripts that represented a variety of functional classes, including several that are essential for virus transmission, such as immunity, blood-feeding, and host-seeking. RNAi-mediated gene silencing of three DENV infection-responsive genes - a cathepsin B, a putative cystatin, and a hypothetical ankyrin repeat-containing protein - significantly modulated DENV replication in the salivary gland. Furthermore, silencing of two DENV infection-responsive odorant-binding protein genes (OBPs) resulted in an overall compromise in blood acquisition from a single host by increasing the time for initiation of probing and the probing time before a successful bloodmeal. We also show that DENV established an extensive infection in the mosquito's main olfactory organs, the antennae, which resulted in changes of the transcript abundance of key host-seeking genes. DENV infection, however, did not significantly impact probing initiation or probing times in our laboratory infection system. Here we show for the first time that the mosquito salivary gland mounts responses to suppress DENV which, in turn, modulates the expression of chemosensory-related genes that regulate feeding behavior. These reciprocal interactions may have the potential to affect DENV transmission between humans.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infection: A Tale of Viral Exploitations and Host Responses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease (arboviral) caused by the Dengue virus. It is one of the prominent public health problems in tropical and subtropical regions with no effective vaccines. Every year around 400 million people get infected by the Dengue virus, with a mortality rate of about 20% among the patients with severe dengue. The Dengue virus belongs to the Flaviviridae family, and it is an enveloped virus with positive-sense single-stranded RNA as the genetic material. Studies of the infection cycle of this virus revealed potential host targets important for the virus replication cycle. Here in this review article, we will be discussing different stages of the Dengue virus infection cycle inside mammalian host cells and how host proteins are exploited by the virus in the course of infection as well as how the host counteracts the virus by eliciting different antiviral responses.

TI  - Dengue Virus Infects Primary Human Hair Follicle Dermal Papilla Cells
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - During the epidemic of the dengue virus (DENV) infection in Taiwan in 2014 and 2015, we observed an abnormally high frequency of increased scalp hair shedding in infected individuals that could not be explained by telogen effluvium. In this study, the mechanism of hair loss caused by DENV was explored. Human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) are essential for hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling. Thus, we established an in vitro DENV infection model in HFDPCs. On immunofluorescence analysis, HFDPCs that were susceptible to DENV infection responded to type I interferon (IFN) treatment, and the cells showed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect. The expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), revealed an inflammatory response in DENV-infected HFDPCs. In particular, DENV infection impaired cell viability, and it activated caspase-associated cell death signaling in HFDPCs. In conclusion, our data indicate that direct infection with DENV causes inflammation and cell death in HFDPCs, which is involved in the mechanisms of hair loss after DENV infection. The knowledge of DENV infection in an immune-privileged tissue, such as hair follicles, may suggest their use for further studies on post-dengue fatigue syndrome (PDFS).

TI  - Dengue Virus Inhibition of Autophagic Flux and Dependency of Viral Replication on Proteasomal Degradation of the Autophagy Receptor p62
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 8026
EP  - 8041
AB  - ABSTRACT Autophagic flux involves formation of autophagosomes and their degradation by lysosomes. Autophagy can either promote or restrict viral replication. In the case of Dengue virus (DENV), several studies report that autophagy supports the viral replication cycle, and describe an increase of autophagic vesicles (AVs) following infection. However, it is unknown how autophagic flux is altered to result in increased AVs. To address this question and gain insight into the role of autophagy during DENV infection, we established an unbiased, image-based flow cytometry approach to quantify autophagic flux under normal growth conditions and in response to activation by nutrient deprivation or the mTOR inhibitor Torin1. We found that DENV induced an initial activation of autophagic flux, followed by inhibition of general and specific autophagy. Early after infection, basal and activated autophagic flux was enhanced. However, during established replication, basal and Torin1-activated autophagic flux was blocked, while autophagic flux activated by nutrient deprivation was reduced, indicating a block to AV formation and reduced AV degradation capacity. During late infection AV levels increased as a result of inefficient fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. In addition, endolysosomal trafficking was suppressed, while lysosomal activities were increased. We further determined that DENV infection progressively reduced levels of the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 via proteasomal degradation. Importantly, stable overexpression of p62 significantly suppressed DENV replication, suggesting a novel role for p62 as a viral restriction factor. Overall, our findings indicate that in the course of DENV infection, autophagy shifts from a supporting to an antiviral role, which is countered by DENV. IMPORTANCE Autophagic flux is a dynamic process starting with the formation of autophagosomes and ending with their degradation after fusion with lysosomes. Autophagy impacts the replication cycle of many viruses. However, thus far the dynamics of autophagy in case of Dengue virus (DENV) infections has not been systematically quantified. Therefore, we used high-content, imaging-based flow cytometry to quantify autophagic flux and endolysosomal trafficking in response to DENV infection. We report that DENV induced an initial activation of autophagic flux, followed by inhibition of general and specific autophagy. Further, lysosomal activity was increased, but endolysosomal trafficking was suppressed confirming the block of autophagic flux. Importantly, we provide evidence that p62, an autophagy receptor, restrict DENV replication and was specifically depleted in DENV-infected cells via increased proteasomal degradation. These results suggest that during DENV infection autophagy shifts from a proviral to an antiviral cellular process, which is counteracted by the virus.

TI  - Dengue Virus Inhibits Alpha Interferon Signaling by Reducing STAT2 Expression
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 5414
EP  - 5420
AB  - ABSTRACT Alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) is a key mediator of innate antiviral responses but has little effect on the established replication of dengue viruses, which are mosquito-borne flaviviruses of immense global health importance. Understanding how the IFN system is inhibited in dengue virus-infected cells would provide critical insights into disease pathogenesis. In a recent study analyzing the ability of individual dengue virus-encoded proteins to antagonize the IFN response, nonstructural (NS) protein 4B and possibly NS2A and NS4A were identified as candidate IFN antagonists. In monkey cells, NS4B appeared to inhibit both the IFN-α/β and IFN-γ signal transduction pathways, which are distinct but overlapping (J. L. Munoz-Jordan, G. G. Sanchez-Burgos, M. Laurent-Rolle, and A. Garcia-Sastre, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:14333-14338, 2003). For this study, we examined the effects of dengue virus on the human IFN system, using cell lines that were stably transfected with self-replicating subgenomic dengue virus RNA (replicons) and that expressed all of the dengue virus nonstructural proteins together. We show here that in replicon-containing cells dengue virus RNA replication and the replication of encephalomyocarditis virus, an IFN-sensitive virus, are resistant to the antiviral effects of IFN-α. The presence of dengue virus replicons reduces global IFN-α-stimulated gene expression and specifically inhibits IFN-α but not IFN-γ signal transduction. In cells containing replicons or infected with dengue virus, we found reduced levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2), which is a key component of IFN-α but not IFN-γ signaling. Collectively, these data show that dengue virus is capable of subverting the human IFN response by down-regulating STAT2 expression.

TI  - Dengue Virus Inhibits Immune Responses in Aedes aegypti Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 5
AB  - The ability of many viruses to manipulate the host antiviral immune response often results in complex host-pathogen interactions. In order to study the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) with the Aedes aegypti immune response, we have characterized the DENV infection-responsive transcriptome of the immune-competent A. aegypti cell line Aag2. As in mosquitoes, DENV infection transcriptionally activated the cell line Toll pathway and a variety of cellular physiological systems. Most notably, however, DENV infection down-regulated the expression levels of numerous immune signaling molecules and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Functional assays showed that transcriptional induction of AMPs from the Toll and IMD pathways in response to bacterial challenge is impaired in DENV-infected cells. In addition, Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacteria species, grew better when co-cultured with DENV-infected cells than with uninfected cells, suggesting a decreased production of AMPs from the IMD pathway in virus-infected cells. Pre-stimulation of the cell line with Gram-positive bacteria prior to DENV infection had no effect on DENV titers, while pre-stimulation with Gram-negative bacteria resulted in an increase in DENV titers. These results indicate that DENV is capable of actively suppressing immune responses in the cells it infects, a phenomenon that may have important consequences for virus transmission and insect physiology.

EP  - 
AB  - Dengue, a widespread arthropod-borne viral disease, remains endemic in more than 100 nations, affecting over 40% of the world's population, with millions of cases reported annually, and has a major burden on global public health systems. The causative agent of this infection is the dengue virus which belongs to the Flaviviridae family of RNA viruses. The DENV infection leads to a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms, ranging from mild to severe, and even fatal in the cases of secondary infection. In the absence of promising antiviral therapies or vaccines to effectively combat the infection, understanding the interaction between the host and pathogen, along with the associated molecular mechanisms, is crucial. In this review, we focused on the specialised functions of various RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their roles at various stages of the viral life cycle. This review examines the intricate interplay between viral and host cellular factors. Notably, numerous host RBPs, including La, eIF2, PTBP1, YBX1, and other hnRNPs, interact with viral components, such as NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5, and most importantly, the viral UTRs (untranslated regions), to facilitate critical stages of the viral life cycle. We comprehensively compiled the specific roles of RBPs in the dengue virus life cycle, including viral entry, translation, transcription, and assembly, and further explored the therapeutic possibilities.

TI  - Dengue Virus M Protein Promotes NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation To Induce Vascular Leakage in Mice
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen, and infections by this virus are prevalent in over 100 tropical and subtropical countries or regions, with approximately 2.5 billion people at risk. DENV infection induces a spectrum of clinical symptoms, ranging from classical dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying DENV pathogenesis. In this study, we reveal that the DENV membrane protein (M) interacts with the host NLRP3 protein to promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which leads to the activation and release of a proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). More importantly, we demonstrate that M protein can induce vascular permeability and vascular leakage and that NLRP3 is required for M-induced vascular leakage in mouse tissues. Collectively, this study reveals a distinct mechanism underlying DENV pathogeneses and provides new insights into the development of therapeutic agents for DENV-associated diseases. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes serious clinical symptoms, including dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Vascular permeability change is the main feature of the diseases, and the abnormal expression of proinflammatory cytokines is the important cause of vascular permeability change. However, the mechanism underlying vascular permeability induced by DENV has not been fully elucidated. Here, we reveal a distinct mechanism by which DENV infection promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) release to induce endothelial permeability and vascular leakage in mice. DENV M protein interacts with NLRP3 to facilitate NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation, which induce proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β activation and release. Notably, M can induce vascular leakage in mouse tissues by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β. More importantly, inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue injuries are induced by M in wild-type (WT) mouse tissues, but they are not affected by M in NLRP3 knockout (NLRP3−/−) mouse tissues. Evans blue intensities in WT mouse tissues are significantly higher than in NLRP3−/− mouse tissues, demonstrating an essential role of NLRP3 in M-induced vascular leakages in mice. Therefore, we propose that upon DENV infection, M interacts with NLRP3 to facilitate inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion, which lead to the induction of endothelial permeability and vascular leakage in mouse tissues. The important role of the DENV-M-NLRP3-IL-1β axis in the induction of vascular leakage provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying DENV pathogenesis and DENV-associated DHF and DSS development.

TI  - Dengue Virus Modulates the Unfolded Protein Response in a Time-dependent Manner*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 286
SP  - 14226
EP  - 14236
AB  - Flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), depend on the host endoplasmic reticulum for translation, replication, and packaging of their genomes. Here we report that DENV-2 infection modulates the unfolded protein response in a time-dependent manner. We show that early DENV-2 infection triggers and then suppresses PERK-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation and that in mid and late DENV-2 infection, the IRE1-XBP1 and ATF6 pathways are activated, respectively. Activation of IRE1-XBP1 correlated with induction of downstream targets GRP78, CHOP, and GADD34. Furthermore, induction of CHOP did not induce apoptotic markers, such as suppression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, activation of caspase-9 or caspase-3, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Finally, we show that DENV-2 replication is affected in PERK−/− and IRE1−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts when compared with wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that time-dependent activation of the unfolded protein response by DENV-2 can override inhibition of translation, prevent apoptosis, and prolong the viral life cycle.

TI  - Dengue Virus NS Proteins Inhibit RIG-I/MAVS Signaling by Blocking TBK1/IRF3 Phosphorylation: Dengue Virus Serotype 1 NS4A Is a Unique Interferon-Regulating Virulence Determinant
JF  - mBio
VL  - 6
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) replication is inhibited by the prior addition of type I interferon or by RIG-I agonists that elicit RIG-I/MAVS/TBK1/IRF3-dependent protective responses. DENV infection of primary human endothelial cells (ECs) results in a rapid increase in viral titer, which suggests that DENV inhibits replication-restrictive RIG-I/interferon beta (IFN-β) induction pathways within ECs. Our findings demonstrate that DENV serotype 4 (DENV4) nonstructural (NS) proteins NS2A and NS4B inhibited RIG-I-, MDA5-, MAVS-, and TBK1/IKKε-directed IFN-β transcription (>80%) but failed to inhibit IFN-β induction directed by STING or constitutively active IRF3-5D. Expression of NS2A and NS4B dose dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3, which suggests that they function at the level of TBK1 complex activation. NS2A and NS4B from DENV1/2/4, as well as the West Nile virus NS4B protein, commonly inhibited TBK1 phosphorylation and IFN-β induction. A comparative analysis of NS4A proteins across DENVs demonstrated that DENV1, but not DENV2 or DENV4, NS4A proteins uniquely inhibited TBK1. These findings indicate that DENVs contain conserved (NS2A/NS4B) and DENV1-specific (NS4A) mechanisms for inhibiting RIG-I/TBK1-directed IFN responses. Collectively, our results define DENV NS proteins that restrict IRF3 and IFN responses and thereby facilitate DENV replication and virulence. Unique DENV1-specific NS4A regulation of IFN induction has the potential to be a virulence determinant that contributes to the increased severity of DENV1 infections and the immunodominance of DENV1 responses during tetravalent DENV1-4 vaccination. IMPORTANCE Our findings demonstrate that NS2A and NS4B proteins from dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, and 4 are inhibitors of RIG-I/MDA5-directed interferon beta (IFN-β) induction and that they accomplish this by blocking TBK1 activation. We determined that IFN inhibition is functionally conserved across NS4B proteins from West Nile virus and DENV1, -2, and -4 viruses. In contrast, DENV1 uniquely encodes an extra IFN regulating protein, NS4A, that inhibits TBK1-directed IFN induction. DENV1 is associated with an increase in severe patient disease, and added IFN regulation by the DENV1 NS4A protein may contribute to increased DENV1 replication, immunodominance, and virulence. The regulation of IFN induction by nonstructural (NS) proteins suggests their potential roles in enhancing viral replication and spread and as potential protein targets for viral attenuation. DENV1-specific IFN regulation needs to be considered in vaccine strategies where enhanced DENV1 replication may interfere with DENV2-4 seroconversion within coadministered tetravalent DENV1-4 vaccines.

TI  - Dengue Virus NS1 Disrupts the Endothelial Glycocalyx, Leading to Hyperpermeability
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent arboviral disease in humans and a major public health problem worldwide. Systemic plasma leakage, leading to hypovolemic shock and potentially fatal complications, is a critical determinant of dengue severity. Recently, we and others described a novel pathogenic effect of secreted dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) in triggering hyperpermeability of human endothelial cells in vitro and systemic vascular leakage in vivo. NS1 was shown to activate toll-like receptor 4 signaling in primary human myeloid cells, leading to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and vascular leakage. However, distinct endothelial cell-intrinsic mechanisms of NS1-induced hyperpermeability remained to be defined. The endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) is a network of membrane-bound proteoglycans and glycoproteins lining the vascular endothelium that plays a key role in regulating endothelial barrier function. Here, we demonstrate that DENV NS1 disrupts the EGL on human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, inducing degradation of sialic acid and shedding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This effect is mediated by NS1-induced expression of sialidases and heparanase, respectively. NS1 also activates cathepsin L, a lysosomal cysteine proteinase, in endothelial cells, which activates heparanase via enzymatic cleavage. Specific inhibitors of sialidases, heparanase, and cathepsin L prevent DENV NS1-induced EGL disruption and endothelial hyperpermeability. All of these effects are specific to NS1 from DENV1-4 and are not induced by NS1 from West Nile virus, a related flavivirus. Together, our data suggest an important role for EGL disruption in DENV NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction during severe dengue disease.

TI  - Dengue Virus NS1 Protein Modulates Cellular Energy Metabolism by Increasing Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Activity
JF  - Journal of Virology

EP  - 11883
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue is one of the main public health concerns worldwide. Recent estimates indicate that over 390 million people are infected annually with the dengue virus (DENV), resulting in thousands of deaths. Among the DENV nonstructural proteins, the NS1 protein is the only one whose function during replication is still unknown. NS1 is a 46- to 55-kDa glycoprotein commonly found as both a membrane-associated homodimer and a soluble hexameric barrel-shaped lipoprotein. Despite its role in the pathogenic process, NS1 is essential for proper RNA accumulation and virus production. In the present study, we identified that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) interacts with intracellular NS1. Molecular docking revealed that this interaction occurs through the hydrophobic protrusion of NS1 and the hydrophobic residues located at the opposite side of the catalytic site. Moreover, addition of purified recombinant NS1 enhanced the glycolytic activity of GAPDH in vitro. Interestingly, we observed that DENV infection promoted the relocalization of GAPDH to the perinuclear region, where NS1 is commonly found. Both DENV infection and expression of NS1 itself resulted in increased GAPDH activity. Our findings indicate that the NS1 protein acts to increase glycolytic flux and, consequently, energy production, which is consistent with the recent finding that DENV induces and requires glycolysis for proper replication. This is the first report to propose that NS1 is an important modulator of cellular energy metabolism. The data presented here provide new insights that may be useful for further drug design and the development of alternative antiviral therapies against DENV. IMPORTANCE Dengue represents a serious public health problem worldwide and is caused by infection with dengue virus (DENV). Estimates indicate that half of the global population is at risk of infection, with almost 400 million cases occurring per year. The NS1 glycoprotein is found in both the intracellular and the extracellular milieus. Despite the fact that NS1 has been commonly associated with DENV pathogenesis, it plays a pivotal but unknown role in the replication process. In an effort to understand the role of intracellular NS1, we demonstrate that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) interacts with NS1. Our results indicate that NS1 increases the glycolytic activity of GAPDH in vitro. Interestingly, the GAPDH activity was increased during DENV infection, and NS1 expression alone was sufficient to enhance intracellular GAPDH activity in BHK-21 cells. Overall, our findings suggest that NS1 is an important modulator of cellular energy metabolism by increasing glycolytic flux.

TI  - Dengue Virus NS1 Uses Scavenger Receptor B1 as a Cell Receptor in Cultured Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - Dengue is the most common viral disease transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The dengue virus NS1 is a multifunctional glycoprotein necessary for viral replication. ABSTRACT The dengue virus NS1 is a multifunctional protein that forms part of replication complexes. NS1 is also secreted, as a hexamer, to the extracellular milieu. Circulating NS1 has been associated with dengue pathogenesis by several mechanisms. Cell binding and internalization of soluble NS1 result in endothelial hyperpermeability and in the downregulation of the innate immune response. In this work, we report that the HDL scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1) in human hepatic cells and a scavenger receptor B1-like in mosquito C6/36 cells act as cell surface binding receptors for dengue virus NS1. The presence of the SRB1 on the plasma membrane of C6/36 cells, as well as in Huh7 cells, was demonstrated by confocal microscopy. The internalization of NS1 can be efficiently blocked by anti-SRB1 antibodies, and previous incubation of the cells with HDL significantly reduces NS1 internalization. Significant reduction in NS1 internalization was observed in C6/36 cells transfected with siRNAs specific for SRB1. In addition, the transient expression of SRB1 in Vero cells, which lacks the receptor, allows NS1 internalization in these cells. Direct interaction between soluble NS1 and the SRB1 in Huh7 and C6/36 cells was demonstrated in situ by proximity ligation assays and in vitro by surface plasmon resonance. Finally, results are presented indicating that the SRB1 also acts as a cell receptor for Zika virus NS1. These results demonstrate that dengue virus NS1, a bona fide lipoprotein, usurps the HDL receptor for cell entry and offers explanations for the altered serum lipoprotein homeostasis observed in dengue patients. IMPORTANCE Dengue is the most common viral disease transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The dengue virus NS1 is a multifunctional glycoprotein necessary for viral replication. NS1 is also secreted as a hexameric lipoprotein and circulates in high concentrations in the sera of patients. Circulating NS1 has been associated with dengue pathogenesis by several mechanisms, including favoring of virus replication in hepatocytes and dendritic cells and disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx leading to hyperpermeability. Those last actions require NS1 internalization. Here, we identify the scavenger cell receptor B1, as the cell-binding receptor for dengue and Zika virus NS1, in cultured liver and in mosquito cells. The results indicate that flavivirus NS1, a bona fide lipoprotein, usurps the human HDL receptor and may offer explanations for the alterations in serum lipoprotein homeostasis observed in dengue patients.

TI  - Dengue Virus NS4b N-Terminus Disordered Region Interacts with NS3 Helicase C-Terminal Subdomain to Enhance Helicase Activity
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Dengue virus replicates its single-stranded RNA genome in membrane-bound complexes formed on the endoplasmic reticulum, where viral non-structural proteins (NS) and RNA co-localize. The NS proteins interact with one another and with the host proteins. The interaction of the viral helicase and protease, NS3, with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5, and NS4b proteins is critical for replication. In vitro, NS3 helicase activity is enhanced by interaction with NS4b. We characterized the interaction between NS3 and NS4b and explained a possible mechanism for helicase activity modulation by NS4b. Our bacterial two-hybrid assay results showed that the N-terminal 57 residues region of NS4b is enough to interact with NS3. The molecular docking of the predicted NS4b structure onto the NS3 structure revealed that the N-terminal disordered region of NS4b wraps around the C-terminal subdomain (CTD) of the helicase. Further, NS3 helicase activity is enhanced upon interaction with NS4b. Molecular dynamics simulations on the NS4b-docked NS3 crystal structure and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence studies suggest that the interaction results in NS3 CTD domain motions. Based on the interpretation of our results in light of the mechanism explained for NS3 helicase, NS4b–NS3 interaction modulating CTD dynamics is a plausible explanation for the helicase activity enhancement.

TI  - Dengue Virus Non-Structural Protein 5
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 9
AB  - The World Health Organization estimates that the yearly number of dengue cases averages 390 million. This mosquito-borne virus disease is endemic in over 100 countries and will probably continue spreading, given the observed trend in global warming. So far, there is no antiviral drug available against dengue, but a vaccine has been recently marketed. Dengue virus also serves as a prototype for the study of other pathogenic flaviviruses that are emerging, like West Nile virus and Zika virus. Upon viral entry into the host cell and fusion of the viral lipid membrane with the endosomal membrane, the viral RNA is released and expressed as a polyprotein, that is then matured into three structural and seven non-structural (NS) proteins. The envelope, membrane and capsid proteins form the viral particle while NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B and NS5 assemble inside a cellular replication complex, which is embedded in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles. In addition to their roles in RNA replication within the infected cell, NS proteins help the virus escape the host innate immunity and reshape the host-cell inner structure. This review focuses on recent progress in characterizing the structure and functions of NS5, a protein responsible for the replication and capping of viral RNA that represents a promising drug target.

TI  - Dengue Virus Non-Structural Protein 5 as a Versatile, Multi-Functional Effector in Host–Pathogen Interactions
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue is emerging as one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral diseases of humans. The 11kb RNA genome of the dengue virus encodes three structural proteins (envelope, pre-membrane, capsid) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5), all of which are translated as a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved by viral and host cellular proteases at specific sites. Non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is the largest of the non-structural proteins, functioning as both an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that replicates the viral RNA and an RNA methyltransferase enzyme (MTase) that protects the viral genome by RNA capping, facilitating polyprotein translation. Within the human host, NS5 interacts with several proteins such as those in the JAK-STAT pathway, thereby interfering with anti-viral interferon signalling. This mini-review presents annotated, consolidated lists of known and potential NS5 interactors in the human host as determined by experimental and computational approaches respectively. The most significant protein interactors and the biological pathways they participate in are also highlighted and their implications discussed, along with the specific serotype of dengue virus as appropriate. This information can potentially stimulate and inform further research efforts towards providing an integrative understanding of the mechanisms by which NS5 manipulates the human-virus interface in general and the innate and adaptive immune responses in particular.

TI  - Dengue Virus Non-structural Protein 1 Modulates Infectious Particle Production via Interaction with the Structural Proteins
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is one of the most enigmatic proteins of the Dengue virus (DENV), playing distinct functions in immune evasion, pathogenesis and viral replication. The recently reported crystal structure of DENV NS1 revealed its peculiar three-dimensional fold; however, detailed information on NS1 function at different steps of the viral replication cycle is still missing. By using the recently reported crystal structure, as well as amino acid sequence conservation, as a guide for a comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis study, we discovered that in addition to being essential for RNA replication, DENV NS1 is also critically required for the production of infectious virus particles. Taking advantage of a trans-complementation approach based on fully functional epitope-tagged NS1 variants, we identified previously unreported interactions between NS1 and the structural proteins Envelope (E) and precursor Membrane (prM). Interestingly, coimmunoprecipitation revealed an additional association with capsid, arguing that NS1 interacts via the structural glycoproteins with DENV particles. Results obtained with mutations residing either in the NS1 Wing domain or in the β-ladder domain suggest that NS1 might have two distinct functions in the assembly of DENV particles. By using a trans-complementation approach with a C-terminally KDEL-tagged ER-resident NS1, we demonstrate that the secretion of NS1 is dispensable for both RNA replication and infectious particle production. In conclusion, our results provide an extensive genetic map of NS1 determinants essential for viral RNA replication and identify a novel role of NS1 in virion production that is mediated via interaction with the structural proteins. These studies extend the list of NS1 functions and argue for a central role in coordinating replication and assembly/release of infectious DENV particles.

TI  - Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1 Induces Vascular Leakage through Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor and Autophagy
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common mosquito-borne flavivirus; it can either cause mild dengue fever or the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). One of the characteristic features of DHF/DSS is vascular leakage; although DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has been proved to induce vascular leakage after binding to Toll-like receptor 4, the down-stream mechanism has not yet been fully understood. In the sera of DENV-infected patients, the concentrations of DENV NS1 and inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) are positively correlated with disease severity, but whether DENV NS1 induces vascular leakage through MIF secretion remains unknown. We demonstrated that recombinant NS1 induced vascular leakage and MIF secretion both in human endothelial cell line HMEC-1 and in mice. Furthermore, these phenomena were inhibited in the presence of anti-NS1 antibodies both in vitro and in vivo. DENV NS1 also induced LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and p62 degradation in endothelial cell line, which indicated the formation of autophagy. To clarify whether MIF or autophagy mediated DENV NS1-induced vascular leakage, various inhibitors were applied. The results showed that DENV NS1-induced vascular leakage and VE-cadherin disarray were blocked in the presence of MIF inhibitors, anti-MIF-antibodies or autophagy inhibitors. An Atg5 knockdown clone further confirmed that autophagy formation of endothelial cells was required in NS1-induced vascular leakage. Furthermore, DENV NS1-induced LC3 puncta were also decreased in the presence of MIF inhibitors, indicating that MIF mediated DENV NS1-induced autophagy. Taken together, the results suggest a potential mechanism of DENV-induced vascular leakage and provide possible therapeutic targets against DHF/DSS.

TI  - Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1–Induced Antibodies Cross-React with Human Plasminogen and Enhance Its Activation
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 196
SP  - 1218
EP  - 1226
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease, and it can cause life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Abnormal activation of the coagulation and fibrinolysis system is one of the hallmarks of DHF/DSS. However, the mechanism underlying hemorrhage in DHF/DSS remains elusive. In previous studies, plasminogen (Plg) cross-reactive Abs, which can recognize DENV nonstructural protein (NS) 1, have been found in dengue patients. However, it is unclear whether these Abs are indeed induced by DENV NS1. Thus, we immunized mice with recombinant NS1 from both bacteria and drosophila to determine whether NS1 can induce Plg cross-reactive Abs. The results from the NS1-immunized mouse sera indicated that NS1 immunization induced Abs that could cross-react with Plg. To study the effects of these NS1-induced Plg cross-reactive Abs on fibrinolysis, we isolated several Plg cross-reactive anti-NS1 mAbs from these mice and found that some of them could enhance Plg activation. In addition, epitope mapping with a phage-displayed random peptide library revealed that one of these mAbs (2A5) could recognize NS1 C-terminal residues 305–311, which share sequence homology with Plg residues 590–597. A synthetic peptide of NS1 residues 305–311 could inhibit the binding of both 2A5 and its Fab to Plg and its enhanced activation. Thus, our results suggest that DENV NS1 can induce Plg cross-reactive Abs through molecular mimicry, which can enhance Plg activation and may contribute to the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS.

TI  - Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 5 (NS5) Assembles into a Dimer with a Unique Methyltransferase and Polymerase Interface
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - Flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) consists of methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains, which catalyze 5’-RNA capping/methylation and RNA synthesis, respectively, during viral genome replication. Although the crystal structure of flavivirus NS5 is known, no data about the quaternary organization of the functional enzyme are available. We report the crystal structure of dengue virus full-length NS5, where eight molecules of NS5 are arranged as four independent dimers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The relative orientation of each monomer within the dimer, as well as the orientations of the MTase and RdRp domains within each monomer, is conserved, suggesting that these structural arrangements represent the biologically relevant conformation and assembly of this multi-functional enzyme. Essential interactions between MTase and RdRp domains are maintained in the NS5 dimer via inter-molecular interactions, providing evidence that flavivirus NS5 can adopt multiple conformations while preserving necessary interactions between the MTase and RdRp domains. Furthermore, many NS5 residues that reduce viral replication are located at either the inter-domain interface within a monomer or at the inter-molecular interface within the dimer. Hence the X-ray structure of NS5 presented here suggests that MTase and RdRp activities could be coordinated as a dimer during viral genome replication.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 11053
EP  - 11061
AB  - ABSTRACT Elevated circulating levels of chemokines have been reported in patients with dengue fever and are proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue disease. To establish in vitro models for chemokine induction by dengue 2 virus (DEN2V), we studied a variety of human cell lines and primary cells. DEN2V infection of HepG2 and primary dendritic cells induced the production of interleukin-8 (IL-8), RANTES, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β, whereas only IL-8 and RANTES were induced following dengue virus infection of HEK293 cells. Chemokine secretion was accompanied by an increase in steady-state mRNA levels. No chemokine induction was observed in HEK293 cells treated with poly(I:C) or alpha interferon, suggesting a direct effect of virus infection. To determine the mechanism(s) involved in the induction of chemokine production by DEN2V, individual dengue virus genes were cloned into plasmids and expressed in HEK293 cells. Transfection of a plasmid expressing NS5 or a dengue virus replicon induced IL-8 gene expression and secretion. RANTES expression was not induced under these conditions, however. Reporter assays showed that IL-8 induction by NS5 was principally through CAAT/enhancer binding protein, whereas DEN2V infection also induced NF-κB. These results indicate a role for the dengue virus NS5 protein in the induction of IL-8 by DEN2V infection. Recruitment and activation of potential target cells to sites of DEN2V replication by virus-induced chemokine production may contribute to viral replication as well as to the inflammatory components of dengue virus disease.

TI  - Dengue Virus RNA Structure Specialization Facilitates Host Adaptation
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - Many viral pathogens cycle between humans and insects. These viruses must have evolved strategies for rapid adaptation to different host environments. However, the mechanistic basis for the adaptation process remains poorly understood. To study the mosquito-human adaptation cycle, we examined changes in RNA structures of the dengue virus genome during host adaptation. Deep sequencing and RNA structure analysis, together with fitness evaluation, revealed a process of host specialization of RNA elements of the viral 3’UTR. Adaptation to mosquito or mammalian cells involved selection of different viral populations harvesting mutations in a single stem-loop structure. The host specialization of the identified RNA structure resulted in a significant viral fitness cost in the non-specialized host, posing a constraint during host switching. Sequence conservation analysis indicated that the identified host adaptable stem loop structure is duplicated in dengue and other mosquito-borne viruses. Interestingly, functional studies using recombinant viruses with single or double stem loops revealed that duplication of the RNA structure allows the virus to accommodate mutations beneficial in one host and deleterious in the other. Our findings reveal new concepts in adaptation of RNA viruses, in which host specialization of RNA structures results in high fitness in the adapted host, while RNA duplication confers robustness during host switching.

Only 2 of 11 cultures from nonimmune infants or children supported viral replication. This study establishes a parallel in the biological behavior of human and simian PBL with respect to the immunological dependence of dengue virus replication in vitro. Elucidation of the mechanism (or mechamisms) regulating growth of dengue virus in leukocytes from immune hosts may contribute to an understanding of the role that virus-leukocyte interactions play in the pathogenesis of human dengue illness.

TI  - Dengue Virus Replication Is Associated with Catecholamine Biosynthesis and Metabolism in Hepatocytes
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Previously, the association between the catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme L-Dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and Dengue virus (DV) replication was demonstrated in liver cells and was found to be mediated at least by the interaction between DDC and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Here, we show that biogenic amines production and uptake impede DV replication in hepatocytes and monocytes, while the virus reduces catecholamine biosynthesis, metabolism, and transport. To examine how catecholamine biosynthesis/metabolism influences DV, first, we verified the role of DDC by altering DDC expression. DDC silencing enhanced virus replication, but not translation, attenuated the negative effect of DDC substrates on the virus and reduced the infection related cell death. Then, the role of the downstream steps of the catecholamine biosynthesis/metabolism was analyzed by chemical inhibition of the respective enzymes, application of their substrates and/or their products; moreover, reserpine, the inhibitor of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), was used to examine the role of uptake/storage of catecholamines on DV. Apart from the role of each enzyme/transporter, these studies revealed that the dopamine uptake, and not the dopamine-signaling, is responsible for the negative effect on DV. Accordingly, all treatments expected to enhance the accumulation of catecholamines in the cell cytosol suppressed DV replication. This was verified by the use of chemical inducers of catecholamine biosynthesis. Last, the cellular redox alterations due to catecholamine oxidation were not related with the inhibition of DV replication. In turn, DV apart from its negative impact on DDC, inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, monoamine oxidase, and VMAT2 expression.

TI  - Dengue Virus Replicative-Form dsRNA Is Recognized by Both RIG-I and MDA5 to Activate Innate Immunity.
JF  - Journal of medical virology
VL  - 97 2
SP  - e70194
EP  - 
AB  - RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) are a family of cytosolic RNA sensors that sense RNA virus infection to activate innate immune response. It is generally believed that different RNA viruses are recognized by either RIG-I or MDA5, two important RLR members, depending on the nature of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are generated by RNA virus replication. Dengue virus (DENV) is an important RNA virus causing serious human diseases. Despite extensive investigations, the molecular basis of the DENV PAMP recognized by the host RLR has been poorly defined. Here, we demonstrated that the DENV infection-induced interferon response is dependent upon both RIG-I and MDA5, with RIG-I playing a predominant role. Next we purified the DENV PAMP RNA from the DENV-infected cells, and demonstrated that the purified DENV PAMP is viral full-length double-stranded RNA bearing 5'ppp modifications, likely representing the viral replicative-form RNA. Finally, we confirmed the nature of the DENV PAMP by reconstituting the viral replicative-form RNA from in vitro synthesized DENV genomic RNA. In conclusion, our work not only defined the molecular basis of the RLR-PAMP interaction during DENV infection, but also revealed the previously underappreciated recognition of a distinct moiety of the same PAMP by different RLRs in innate immunity against RNA viruses.

TI  - Dengue Virus Reporter Replicon is a Valuable Tool for Antiviral Drug Discovery and Analysis of Virus Replication Mechanisms
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue, the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease, is caused by the dengue virus (DENV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, and is a considerable public health threat in over 100 countries, with 2.5 billion people living in high-risk areas. However, no specific antiviral drug or licensed vaccine currently targets DENV infection. The replicon system has all the factors needed for viral replication in cells. Since the development of replicon systems, transient and stable reporter replicons, as well as reporter viruses, have been used in the study of various virological aspects of DENV and in the identification of DENV inhibitors. In this review, we summarize the DENV reporter replicon system and its applications in high-throughput screening (HTS) for identification of anti-DENV inhibitors. We also describe the use of this system in elucidation of the mechanisms of virus replication and viral dynamics in vivo and in vitro.

TI  - Dengue Virus Selectively Annexes Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Translation Machinery as a Strategy for Co-opting Host Cell Protein Synthesis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 92
AB  - ABSTRACT A primary question in dengue virus (DENV) biology is the molecular strategy for recruitment of host cell protein synthesis machinery. Here, we combined cell fractionation, ribosome profiling, and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the subcellular organization of viral genome translation and replication as well as host cell translation and its response to DENV infection. We report that throughout the viral life cycle, DENV plus- and minus-strand RNAs were highly partitioned to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), identifying the ER as the primary site of DENV translation. DENV infection was accompanied by an ER compartment-specific remodeling of translation, where ER translation capacity was subverted from host transcripts to DENV plus-strand RNA, particularly at late stages of infection. Remarkably, translation levels and patterns in the cytosol compartment were only modestly affected throughout the experimental time course of infection. Comparisons of ribosome footprinting densities of the DENV plus-strand RNA and host mRNAs indicated that DENV plus-strand RNA was only sparsely loaded with ribosomes. Combined, these observations suggest a mechanism where ER-localized translation and translational control mechanisms, likely cis encoded, are used to repurpose the ER for DENV virion production. Consistent with this view, we found ER-linked cellular stress response pathways commonly associated with viral infection, namely, the interferon response and unfolded protein response, to be only modestly activated during DENV infection. These data support a model where DENV reprograms the ER protein synthesis and processing environment to promote viral survival and replication while minimizing the activation of antiviral and proteostatic stress response pathways. IMPORTANCE DENV, a prominent human health threat with no broadly effective or specific treatment, depends on host cell translation machinery for viral replication, immune evasion, and virion biogenesis. The molecular mechanism by which DENV commandeers the host cell protein synthesis machinery and the subcellular organization of DENV replication and viral protein synthesis is poorly understood. Here, we report that DENV has an almost exclusively ER-localized life cycle, with viral replication and translation largely restricted to the ER. Surprisingly, DENV infection largely affects only ER-associated translation, with relatively modest effects on host cell translation in the cytosol. DENV RNA translation is very inefficient, likely representing a strategy to minimize disruption of ER proteostasis. Overall these findings demonstrate that DENV has evolved an ER-compartmentalized life cycle; thus, targeting the molecular signatures and regulation of the DENV-ER interaction landscape may reveal strategies for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Blocks Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase and Nuclear Factor-κB Activation to Downregulate Cytokine Production
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Background Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease threatening human health around the world. Type I interferon (IFN) and cytokine production are crucial in the innate immune system. We previously reported that DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) induced low levels of interferon regulatory factor 3 and NF-κB activation, thus leading to reduced production of IFN-β in the early phase of infection. Here, we determined whether DENV infection not only hampers type I IFN activation but also cytokine production triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Methodology/Principal Findings We used quantitative RT-PCR and found that only low levels of IFN-β and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA were detected in DENV-2–infected bone-marrow–derived dendritic cells. Furthermore, DENV-2 infection repressed cytokine production triggered by TLR signaling. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this suppression event, we measured NF-κB activation by p65 nuclear translocation and luciferase reporter assay and found that NF-κB activation triggered by TLR ligands was blocked by DENV-2 infection. As well, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity was suppressed by DENV-2 infection. Conclusions/Significance To downregulate the host innate immunity, DENV-2 by itself is a weak inducer of type I IFN and cytokines, furthermore DENV-2 can also block the TLR-triggered ERK–NF-κB activation and cytokine production.

TI  - Dengue Virus Serotype 2 and Its Non-Structural Proteins 2A and 2B Activate NLRP3 Inflammasome
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent and rapidly transmitted mosquito-borne viral disease of humans. One of the fundamental innate immune responses to viral infections includes the processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL-1β and IL-18) through the activation of inflammasome. Dengue virus stimulates the Nod-like receptor (NLRP3-specific inflammasome), however, the specific mechanism(s) by which dengue virus activates the NLRP3 inflammasome is unknown. In this study, we investigated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in endothelial cells (HMEC-1) following dengue virus infection. Our results showed that dengue infection as well as the NS2A and NS2B protein expression increase the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and further apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing caspase recruitment domain (ASC) oligomerization, and IL-1β secretion through caspase-1 activation. Specifically, we have demonstrated that NS2A and NS2B, two proteins of dengue virus that behave as putative viroporins, were sufficient to stimulate the NLRP3 inflammasome complex in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed endothelial cells. In summary, our observations provide insight into the dengue-induced inflammatory response mechanism and highlight the importance of DENV-2 NS2A and NS2B proteins in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome during dengue virus infection.

TI  - Dengue Virus Serotype-2 Interferes with the Formation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps
JF  - Intervirology
VL  - 58
SP  - 250
EP  - 259
AB  - Objectives: Neutrophils play an important role in the control of pathogens through several mechanisms, including phagocytosis and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The latter consists of DNA as a backbone with embedded antimicrobial peptides, histones, and proteases, providing a matrix to entrap and in some cases to kill microbes. Some metabolic requirements for NET formation have recently been described. The virus-induced formation of NETs and the role of these traps in viral infections remain scarcely reported. Here, we analyzed whether dengue virus serotype-2 (DENV-2) induces NET formation and the DENV-2 effect on phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced NETs. Methods: Peripheral blood-derived neutrophils were exposed in vitro to DENV-2 or exposed to DENV-2 and then stimulated with PMA. NET formation was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Cell membrane Glut-1, glucose uptake, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were assessed. Results: DENV-2 does not induce the formation of NETs. Moreover, DENV-2 inhibits PMA-induced formation of NETs by about 80%. This effect is not related to the production of ROS. The mechanism seemingly accountable for this inhibitory effect is the DENV-2-mediated inhibition of PMA-induced glucose uptake by neutrophils. Conclusion: Our results suggest that DENV-2 inhibits glucose uptake as a metabolism-based way to avoid the formation of NETs.

TI  - Dengue Virus Subverts Host Innate Immunity by Targeting Adaptor Protein MAVS
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 7219
EP  - 7230
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common mosquito-borne virus infecting humans and is currently a serious global health challenge. To establish infection in its host cells, DENV must subvert the production and/or antiviral effects of interferon (IFN). The aim of this study was to understand the mechanisms by which DENV suppresses IFN production. We determined that DENV NS4A interacts with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which was previously found to activate NF-κB and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), thus inducing type I IFN in the mitochondrion-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs). We further demonstrated that NS4A is associated with the N-terminal CARD-like (CL) domain and the C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain of MAVS. This association prevented the binding of MAVS to RIG-I, resulting in the repression of RIG-I-induced IRF3 activation and, consequently, the abrogation of IFN production. Collectively, our findings illustrate a new molecular mechanism by which DENV evades the host immune system and suggest new targets for anti-DENV strategies. IMPORTANCE Type I interferon (IFN) constitutes the first line of host defense against invading viruses. To successfully establish infection, dengue virus (DENV) must counteract either the production or the function of IFN. The mechanism by which DENV suppresses IFN production is poorly understood and characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that the DENV NS4A protein plays an important role in suppressing interferon production through binding MAVS and disrupting the RIG-I–MAVS interaction in mitochondrion-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs). Our study reveals that MAVS is a novel host target of NS4A and provides a molecular mechanism for DENV evasion of the host innate immune response. These findings have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of DENV and may provide new insights into using NS4A as a therapeutic and/or prevention target.

TI  - Dengue Virus Subverts the Interferon Induction Pathway via NS2B/3 Protease-IκB Kinase ε Interaction
JF  - Clinical and Vaccine Immunology
VL  - 21
SP  - 29
EP  - 38
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue is the world's most common mosquito-borne viral infection and a leading cause of morbidity throughout the tropics and subtropics. Viruses are known to evade the establishment of an antiviral state by regulating the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a critical transcription factor in the alpha/beta interferon induction pathway. Here, we show that dengue virus (DENV) circumvents the induction of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor (RLR) pathway during infection by blocking serine 386 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. This effect is associated with the expression of nonstructural 2B/3 protein (NS2B/3) protease in human cells. Using interaction assays, we found that NS2B/3 interacts with the cellular IκB kinase ε (IKKε). Docking computational analysis revealed that in this interaction, NS2B/3 masks the kinase domain of IKKε and potentially affects its functionality. This observation is supported by the DENV-associated inhibition of the kinase activity of IKKε. Our data identify IKKε as a novel target of DENV NS2B/3 protease.

TI  - Dengue Virus Targets Nrf2 for NS2B3-Mediated Degradation Leading to Enhanced Oxidative Stress and Viral Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that threatens 2.5 billion people in more than 100 countries annually. Dengue infection induces a spectrum of clinical symptoms, ranging from classical dengue fever to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome; however, the complexities of DENV immunopathogenesis remain controversial. Previous studies have reported the importance of the transcription factor Nrf2 in the control of redox homeostasis and antiviral/inflammatory or death responses to DENV. Importantly, the production of reactive oxygen species and the subsequent stress response have been linked to the development of inflammation and progression toward the more severe forms of the disease. Here, we demonstrate that DENV uses the NS2B3 protease complex to strategically target Nrf2 for degradation, leading to a progressive increase in oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death in infected cells. This study underlines the pivotal role of the Nrf2 regulatory network in the context of DENV infection. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that infects upward of 300 million people annually and has the potential to cause fatal hemorrhagic fever and shock. While the parameters contributing to dengue immunopathogenesis remain unclear, the collapse of redox homeostasis and the damage induced by oxidative stress have been correlated with the development of inflammation and progression toward the more severe forms of disease. In the present study, we demonstrate that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) late after DENV infection (>24 hpi) resulted from a disruption in the balance between oxidative stress and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidant response. The DENV NS2B3 protease complex strategically targeted Nrf2 for degradation in a proteolysis-independent manner; NS2B3 licensed Nrf2 for lysosomal degradation. Impairment of the Nrf2 regulator by the NS2B3 complex inhibited the antioxidant gene network and contributed to the progressive increase in ROS levels, along with increased virus replication and inflammatory or apoptotic gene expression. By 24 hpi, when increased levels of ROS and antiviral proteins were observed, it appeared that the proviral effect of ROS overcame the antiviral effects of the interferon (IFN) response. Overall, these studies demonstrate that DENV infection disrupts the regulatory interplay between DENV-induced stress responses, Nrf2 antioxidant signaling, and the host antiviral immune response, thus exacerbating oxidative stress and inflammation in DENV infection. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that threatens 2.5 billion people in more than 100 countries annually.

TI  - Dengue Virus Targets the Adaptor Protein MITA to Subvert Host Innate Immunity
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue is one of the most important arboviral diseases caused by infection of four serotypes of dengue virus (DEN). We found that activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) triggered by viral infection and by foreign DNA and RNA stimulation was blocked by DEN-encoded NS2B3 through a protease-dependent mechanism. The key adaptor protein in type I interferon pathway, human mediator of IRF3 activation (MITA) but not the murine homologue MPYS, was cleaved in cells infected with DEN-1 or DEN-2 and with expression of the enzymatically active protease NS2B3. The cleavage site of MITA was mapped to LRR↓96G and the function of MITA was suppressed by dengue protease. DEN replication was reduced with overexpression of MPYS but not with MITA, while DEN replication was enhanced by MPYS knockdown, indicating an antiviral role of MITA/MPYS against DEN infection. The involvement of MITA in DEN-triggered innate immune response was evidenced by reduction of IRF3 activation and IFN induction in cells with MITA knockdown upon DEN-2 infection. NS2B3 physically interacted with MITA, and the interaction and cleavage of MITA could be further enhanced by poly(dA:dT) stimulation. Thus, we identified MITA as a novel host target of DEN protease and provide the molecular mechanism of how DEN subverts the host innate immunity.

TI  - Dengue Virus Type 1 Nonstructural Glycoprotein NS1 Is Secreted from Mammalian Cells as a Soluble Hexamer in a Glycosylation-Dependent Fashion
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 73
SP  - 6104
EP  - 6110
AB  - ABSTRACT Nonstructural glycoprotein NS1, specified by dengue virus type 1 (Den-1), is secreted from infected green monkey kidney (Vero) cells in a major soluble form characterized by biochemical and biophysical means as a unique hexameric species. This noncovalently bound oligomer is formed by three dimeric subunits and has a molecular mass of 310 kDa and a Stokes radius of 64.4 Å. During protein export, one of the two oligosaccharides of NS1 is processed into an endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase F-resistant complex-type sugar while the other remains of the polymannose type, protected in the dimeric subunit from the action of maturation enzymes. Complete processing of the complex-type sugar appears to be required for efficient release of soluble NS1 into the culture fluid of infected cells, as suggested by the repressive effects of the N-glycan processing inhibitors swainsonine and deoxymannojyrimicin. These results, together with observations related to the absence of secretion of NS1 from Den-infected insect cells, suggest that maturation and secretion of hexameric NS1 depend on the glycosylation status of the host cell.

TI  - Dengue Virus Type 2 (DENV2)-Induced Oxidative Responses in Monocytes from Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD)-Deficient and G6PD Normal Subjects
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 8
AB  - Background Dengue virus is endemic in peninsular Malaysia. The clinical manifestations vary depending on the incubation period of the virus as well as the immunity of the patients. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is prevalent in Malaysia where the incidence is 3.2%. It has been noted that some G6PD-deficient individuals suffer from more severe clinical presentation of dengue infection. In this study, we aim to investigate the oxidative responses of DENV2-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals. Methodology Monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals were infected with DENV2 and infection rate, levels of oxidative species, nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anions (O2 −), and oxidative stress were determined and compared with normal controls. Principal Findings Monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals exhibited significantly higher infection rates compared to normal controls. In an effort to explain the reason for this enhanced susceptibility, we investigated the production of NO and O2 − in the monocytes of individuals with G6PD deficiency compared with normal controls. We found that levels of NO and O2 − were significantly lower in the DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals compared with normal controls. Furthermore, the overall oxidative stress in DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals was significantly higher when compared to normal controls. Correlation studies between DENV-infected cells and oxidative state of monocytes further confirmed these findings. Conclusions/Significance Altered redox state of DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals appears to augment viral replication in these cells. DENV-infected G6PD-deficient individuals may contain higher viral titers, which may be significant in enhanced virus transmission. Furthermore, granulocyte dysfunction and higher viral loads in G6PD-deificient individuals may result in severe form of dengue infection.

TI  - Dengue Virus Type 2 Antagonizes IFN-α but Not IFN-γ Antiviral Effect via Down-Regulating Tyk2-STAT Signaling in the Human Dendritic Cell1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 174

AB  - The immunopathogenesis mechanism of dengue virus (DV) infection remains elusive. We previously showed that the target of DV in humans is dendritic cells (DCs), the primary sentinels of immune system. We also observed that despite the significant amount of IFN-α induced; DV particles remain massively produced from infected DCs. It suggests that DV may antagonize the antiviral effect of IFN-α. Recent work in animal studies demonstrated the differential critical roles of antiviral cytokines, namely IFN-α/IFN-β and IFN-γ, in blocking early viral production and in preventing viral-mediated disease, respectively. In this study, we examined the effects of IFN-α and IFN-γ in DV infection of monocyte-derived DCs. We showed that the preinfection treatment with either IFN-α or IFN-γ effectively armed DCs and limited viral production in infected cells. However, after infection, DV developed mechanisms to counteract the protection from lately added IFN-α, but not IFN-γ. Such a selective antagonism on antiviral effect of IFN-α, but not IFN-γ, correlated with down-regulated tyrosine-phosphorylation and DNA-binding activities of STAT1 and STAT3 transcription factors by DV. Furthermore, subsequent studies into the underlying mechanisms revealed that DV attenuated IFN-α-induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of Tyk2, an upstream molecule of STAT activation, but had no effect on expression of both IFN-α receptor 1 and IFN-α receptor 2. Moreover, DV infection by itself could activate STAT1 and STAT3 through IFN-α-dependent and both IFN-α-dependent and IFN-α-independent mechanisms, respectively. These observations provide very useful messages with physiological significance in investigation of the pathogenesis, the defense mechanisms of human hosts and the therapeutic considerations in DV infection.

TI  - Dengue Virus Type 2 Infections of Aedes aegypti Are Modulated by the Mosquito's RNA Interference Pathway
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 5
AB  - A number of studies have shown that both innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms greatly influence the course of human dengue virus (DENV) infections, but little is known about the innate immune response of the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti to arbovirus infection. We present evidence here that a major component of the mosquito innate immune response, RNA interference (RNAi), is an important modulator of mosquito infections. The RNAi response is triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which occurs in the cytoplasm as a result of positive-sense RNA virus infection, leading to production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These siRNAs are instrumental in degradation of viral mRNA with sequence homology to the dsRNA trigger and thereby inhibition of virus replication. We show that although dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) infection of Ae. aegypti cultured cells and oral infection of adult mosquitoes generated dsRNA and production of DENV2-specific siRNAs, virus replication and release of infectious virus persisted, suggesting viral circumvention of RNAi. We also show that DENV2 does not completely evade RNAi, since impairing the pathway by silencing expression of dcr2, r2d2, or ago2, genes encoding important sensor and effector proteins in the RNAi pathway, increased virus replication in the vector and decreased the extrinsic incubation period required for virus transmission. Our findings indicate a major role for RNAi as a determinant of DENV transmission by Ae. aegypti.

TI  - Dengue Virus Type 2 Modulates Endothelial Barrier Function through CD73
JF  - The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene
VL  - 88
SP  - 89
EP  - 94
AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever is characterized by a unique vascular leakage syndrome. The mechanisms of endothelial barrier dysfunction in dengue hemorrhagic fever are not well understood. We examined the modulation of endothelial barrier function in dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) infections using primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We demonstrated that the increase in endothelial barrier function within 72 hours after DENV2 infection is mediated by type I interferon–dependent CD73 up-regulation. After 72 hours, DENV2 slowed the recovery of endothelial barrier function in response to tumor necrosis factor-α or vascular endothelial growth factor. This phenomenon was likely caused by type I interferon receptor signaling inhibition and lower CD73 levels in DENV2-infected endothelial cells. Our findings suggest that during DENV2 infection, endothelial barrier homeostasis is maintained by a balance between pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic cytokines, and type I interferon–dependent CD73 expression and activity.

TI  - Dengue Virus Type 2: Protein Binding and Active Replication in Human Central Nervous System Cells
JF  - The Scientific World Journal
VL  - 2013
AB  - An increased number of dengue cases with neurological complications have been reported in recent years. The lack of reliable animal models for dengue has hindered studies on dengue virus (DENV) pathogenesis and cellular tropism in vivo. We further investigate the tropism of DENV for the human central nervous system (CNS), characterizing DENV interactions with cell surface proteins in human CNS cells by virus overlay protein binding assays (VOPBA) and coimmunoprecipitations. In VOPBA, three membrane proteins (60, 70, and 130 kDa) from the gray matter bound the entire virus particle, whereas only a 70 kDa protein bound in white matter. The coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed three proteins from gray matter consistently binding virus particles, one clearly distinguishable protein (~32 kDa) and two less apparent proteins (100 and 130 kDa). Monoclonal anti-NS3 targeted the virus protein in primary cell cultures of human CNS treated with DENV-2, which also stained positive for NeuH, a neuron-specific marker. Thus, our results indicate (1) that DENV-2 exhibited a direct tropism for human neurons and (2) that human neurons sustain an active DENV replication as was demonstrated by the presence of the NS3 viral antigen in primary cultures of these cells treated with DENV-2.

TI  - Dengue Virus Uses a Non‐Canonical Function of the Host GBF1‐Arf‐COPI System for Capsid Protein Accumulation on Lipid Droplets
JF  - Traffic
VL  - 16
AB  - Dengue viruses cause the most important human viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. In recent years, a great deal has been learned about molecular details of dengue virus genome replication; however, little is known about genome encapsidation and the functions of the viral capsid protein. During infection, dengue virus capsid progressively accumulates around lipid droplets (LDs) by an unknown mechanism. Here, we examined the process by which the viral capsid is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where the protein is synthesized, to LDs. Using different methods of intervention, we found that the GBF1‐Arf1/Arf4‐COPI pathway is necessary for capsid transport to LDs, while the process is independent of both COPII components and Golgi integrity. The transport was sensitive to Brefeldin A, while a drug resistant form of GBF1 was sufficient to restore capsid subcellular distribution in infected cells. The mechanism by which LDs gain or lose proteins is still an open question. Our results support a model in which the virus uses a non‐canonical function of the COPI system for capsid accumulation on LDs, providing new ideas for antiviral strategies.

TI  - Dengue Virus Utilizes a Novel Strategy for Translation Initiation When Cap-Dependent Translation Is Inhibited
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 2976
EP  - 2986
AB  - ABSTRACT Viruses have developed numerous mechanisms to usurp the host cell translation apparatus. Dengue virus (DEN) and other flaviviruses, such as West Nile and yellow fever viruses, contain a 5′ m7GpppN-capped positive-sense RNA genome with a nonpolyadenylated 3′ untranslated region (UTR) that has been presumed to undergo translation in a cap-dependent manner. However, the means by which the DEN genome is translated effectively in the presence of capped, polyadenylated cellular mRNAs is unknown. This report demonstrates that DEN replication and translation are not affected under conditions that inhibit cap-dependent translation by targeting the cap-binding protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4E, a key regulator of cellular translation. We further show that under cellular conditions in which translation factors are limiting, DEN can alternate between canonical cap-dependent translation initiation and a noncanonical mechanism that appears not to require a functional m7G cap. This DEN noncanonical translation is not mediated by an internal ribosome entry site but requires the interaction of the DEN 5′ and 3′ UTRs for activity, suggesting a novel strategy for translation of animal viruses.

EP  - 1341
AB  - Several independent groups have published that autophagy is required for optimal RNA replication of dengue virus (DENV). Initially, it was postulated that autophagosomes might play a structural role in replication complex formation. However, cryo-EM tomography of DENV replication complexes showed that DENV replicates on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternae invaginations and not on classical autophagosomes. Recently, it was reported that autophagy plays an indirect role in DENV replication by modulating cellular lipid metabolism. DENV-induced autophagosomes deplete cellular triglycerides that are stored in lipid droplets, leading to increased β-oxidation and energy production. This is the first example of a virus triggering autophagy to modulate cellular physiology. In this review, we summarize these data and discuss new questions and implications for autophagy during DENV replication.

JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 14
AB  - In recent years, Dengue virus (DENV) has continued to pose significant health risks in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide, raising health alerts worldwide. It can cause hyperviremia in humans and can even lead to fatal clinical diseases. The life cycle of DENV is intricately linked to cellular lipids, and the virus selectively utilizes relevant enzymes involved in lipid metabolism to modulate the existing metabolic system in host cells during entry, replication, assembly, and other stages, thereby creating an environment conducive to its complete replication cycle. At present, there is a lack of effective and specific anti-DENV treatment measures. This review summarizes the recently identified lipid metabolism molecules and metabolic related diseases that affect DENV infection, explores the dependence of DENV on lipid metabolism and provides potential targets for the treatment of dengue fever (DF).

TI  - Dengue Virus and the Relationship with MicroRNAs
JF  - Dengue Fever in a One Health Perspective
AB  - Dengue is an acute febrile disease caused by a virus of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, endemic in tropical regions of the globe. The agent is a virus with single-stranded RNA, classified into four distinct dengue virus (DENV) serotypes: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. The host’s innate and adaptive immune responses play an essential role in determining the natural history of viral infections, especially in dengue. In this context, it has observed in recent years that the presence of RNA interference (RNAi) in viral infection processes is increasing, as well as immune defense. The context microRNAs (miRNAs) go for stood out, as their presence during viral infection, both in the replication of the virus and in the defense against these infections, becomes increasingly noticeable, therefore, making it increasingly necessary to better understand the role of these small RNAs within viral infection by DENV and what their consequences are in aggravating the consequences of patients affected by this disease.

As positive-strand RNA viruses, they each replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells and induce distinct membranous replication compartments where most, if not all, steps of the viral life cycle occur. This Gem briefly reviews the most recent insights into the architecture and functional properties of membranous replication and assembly sites induced by DENV and HCV.

TI  - Dengue Virus-2 Infection Affects Fecundity and Elicits Specific Transcriptional Changes in the Ovaries of Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue fever (DF), caused by the dengue virus (DENV), is the most burdensome arboviral disease in the world, with an estimated 400 million infections each year. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the main vector of DENV and transmits several other human pathogens, including Zika, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses. Previous studies have shown that the pathogen infection of mosquitoes can alter reproductive fitness, revealing specific vector-pathogen interactions that are key determinants of vector competence. However, only a handful of studies have examined the effect of DENV infection in A. aegypti, showing a reduction in lifespan and fecundity over multiple blood meals. To provide a more comprehensive analysis of the impact of DENV infection on egg laying and fecundity, we assessed egg laying timing in DENV-2 blood-fed mosquitoes (infected group) compared to mock blood-fed mosquitoes (control group). We confirmed a significant decrease in fecundity during the first gonadotrophic cycle. To further investigate this phenotype and the underlying DENV-2 infection-dependent changes in gene expression, we conducted a transcriptomic analysis for differentially expressed genes in the ovaries of A. aegypti infected with DENV-2 vs. mock-infected mosquitoes. This analysis reveals several DENV-2-regulated genes; among them, we identified a group of 12 metabolic genes that we validated using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Interestingly, two genes found to be upregulated in DENV-infected mosquito ovaries exhibited an antiviral role for DENV-2 in an Aedes cell line. Altogether, this study offers useful insights into the virus-vector interface, highlighting the importance of gene expression changes in the mosquito’s ovary during DENV-2 infection in the first gonadotrophic  cycle,  triggering  antiviral  responses  that  may  possibly  interfere  with mosquito reproduction. This information is extremely relevant for further investigation of A. aegypti’s ability to tolerate viruses since virally infected mosquitoes in nature constitute a powerful source of supporting viruses during intra-epidemic periods, causing a huge burden on the public health system. Graphical Abstract Aedes aegypti first gonadotrophic cycle is altered by DENV-2 infection.

VL  - 187
SP  - 6483
EP  - 6490
AB  - Dengue virus infection can lead to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in patients. Abnormal activation of the coagulation and fibrinolysis system is one of the hallmarks associated with DHF/DSS patients. However, the mechanisms that cause pathology in DHF/DSS patients are still unclear. Because conversion of plasminogen (Plg) to plasmin (Plm) is the first step in the activation of fibrinolysis, Abs against Plg found in DHF/DSS patients may be important. Therefore, to investigate the specificity, function, and possible origin of these Abs, we generated several Plg cross-reactive mAbs from DENV-immunized mice. An IgG mAb, 6H11, which recognizes an epitope associated with a dengue envelope protein, demonstrated a high level of cross-reactivity with Plg. The 6H11 Ab was further characterized with regard to its effect on Plg activation. Using Plm-specific chromogenic substrate S-2251, we found that mAb 6H11 demonstrated serine protease activity and could convert Plg directly to Plm. The serine protease activity of mAb 6H11 was further confirmed using serine protease chromogenic substrate S-2288. In addition, we found several Plg cross-reactive mAbs that could enhance urokinase-induced Plg activation. Lastly, mAb 6H11 could induce Plm activity and increase the level of D-dimer (a fibrin degradation product) in both human and mouse platelet-poor plasma. Taken together, these data suggest DENV-induced Plg cross-reactive Abs may enhance Plg conversion to Plm, which would be expected to contribute to hyperfibrinolysis in DHF/DSS patients.

TI  - Dengue Virus-Induced Inflammation of the Endothelium and the Potential Roles of Sphingosine Kinase-1 and MicroRNAs
JF  - Mediators of Inflammation
VL  - 2015
AB  - One of the main pathogenic effects of severe dengue virus (DENV) infection is a vascular leak syndrome. There are no available antivirals or specific DENV treatments and without hospital support severe DENV infection can be life-threatening. The cause of the vascular leakage is permeability changes in the endothelial cells lining the vasculature that are brought about by elevated vasoactive cytokine and chemokines induced following DENV infection. The source of these altered cytokine and chemokines is traditionally believed to be from DENV-infected cells such as monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells. Herein we discuss the evidence for the endothelium as an additional contributor to inflammatory and innate responses during DENV infection which may affect endothelial cell function, in particular the ability to maintain vascular integrity. Furthermore, we hypothesise roles for two factors, sphingosine kinase-1 and microRNAs (miRNAs), with a focus on several candidate miRNAs, which are known to control normal vascular function and inflammatory responses. Both of these factors may be potential therapeutic targets to regulate inflammation of the endothelium during DENV infection.

TI  - Dengue Virus-Infected Dendritic Cells, but Not Monocytes, Activate Natural Killer Cells through a Contact-Dependent Mechanism Involving Adhesion Molecules
JF  - mBio
VL  - 8
AB  - ABSTRACT Natural killer (NK) cells play a protective role against dengue virus (DENV) infection, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Using an optimized humanized mouse model, we show that human NK cells, through the secretion of gamma interferon (IFN-γ), are critical in the early defense against DENV infection. Depletion of NK cells or neutralization of IFN-γ leads to increased viremia and more severe thrombocytopenia and liver damage in humanized mice. In vitro studies using autologous human NK cells show that DENV-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs), but not monocytes, activate NK cells in a contact-dependent manner, resulting in upregulation of CD69 and CD25 and secretion of IFN-γ. Blocking adhesion molecules (LFA-1, DNAM-1, CD2, and 2β4) on NK cells abolishes NK cell activation, IFN-γ secretion, and the control of DENV replication. NK cells activated by infected MDDCs also inhibit DENV infection in monocytes. These findings show the essential role of human NK cells in protection against acute DENV infection in vivo, identify adhesion molecules and dendritic cells required for NK cell activation, and delineate the sequence of events for NK cell activation and protection against DENV infection. IMPORTANCE Dengue is a mosquito-transmitted viral disease with a range of symptoms, from mild fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever. The diverse disease manifestation is thought to result from a complex interplay between viral and host factors. Using mice engrafted with a human immune system, we show that human NK cells inhibit virus infection through secretion of the cytokine gamma interferon and reduce disease pathogenesis, including depletion of platelets and liver damage. During a natural infection, DENV initially infects dendritic cells in the skin. We find that NK cells interact with infected dendritic cells through physical contact mediated by adhesion molecules and become activated before they can control virus infection. These results show a critical role of human NK cells in controlling DENV infection in vivo and reveal the sequence of molecular and cellular events that activate NK cells to control dengue virus infection.

TI  - Dengue Virus: Host-Pathogen Interactions and Emerging Role of DNA Vaccines
JF  - Journal of Human Virology & Retrovirology
VL  - 3
AB  - Dengue virus infections are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in Southeast Asia, South and Central America with 24’000 deaths annually. Two factors are accountable for the severe outcomes of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF); one is the virulence of the virus and second is the cross-reactivity of various dengue serotypes with the immune system of the host. Rapid rise in the levels of various cytokines, particularly Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin-2 (IL-2), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-8 (IL-8) have a major role in inducing distinctive clinical presentations of DHF. These range from simple plasma leakage to hemorrhagic problems and even shock. Another hallmark of DHF is the presence of cross reactive primary antibodies which produce an intense immune response in secondary infection resulting in immune mediated pathology seen in DHF. There have been many attempts made in the past for the development of a suitable vaccine for dengue fever. Vaccination using plasmid DNA against dengue fever is an active area of research. In this review the role of different cells in the multiplication of dengue virus and viral interactions with the immune system have been discussed. Special emphasis is given to the nature of DNA vaccines in general developmental efforts of a dengue fever vaccine.

TI  - Dengue activates mTORC2 signaling to counteract apoptosis and maximize viral replication
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions in at least two distinct complexes: mTORC1, which regulates cellular anabolic-catabolic homeostasis, and mTORC2, which is an important regulator of cell survival and cytoskeletal maintenance. mTORC1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of flaviviruses including dengue, where it contributes to the establishment of a pro-viral autophagic state. In contrast, the role of mTORC2 in viral pathogenesis is unknown. In this study, we explore the consequences of a physical protein-protein interaction between dengue non-structural protein 5 (NS5) and host cell mTOR proteins during infection. Using shRNA to differentially target mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, we show that mTORC2 is required for optimal dengue replication. Furthermore, we show that mTORC2 is activated during viral replication, and that mTORC2 counteracts virus-induced apoptosis, promoting the survival of infected cells. This work reveals a novel mechanism by which the dengue flavivirus can promote cell survival to maximize viral replication.

TI  - Dengue and Soluble Mediators of the Innate Immune System
JF  - Tropical Medicine and Health
VL  - 39

EP  - 62
AB  - Huge emphasis has been placed on the role of the adaptive immune system in dengue pathogenesis. Yet there is increasing evidence for the importance of the innate immune system in regulating dengue infection and possibly influencing the disease. This review focuses on the interplay between the innate immune system and dengue and highlights the role of soluble immunological mediators. Type I and type II interferons of the innate immune system demonstrate non-overlapping roles in dengue infection. Furthermore, while some IFN responses to dengue are protective, others may exert disease-related effects on the host. But aside from interferons, a number of cytokines have also been implicated in dengue pathogenesis. Our expanding knowledge of cytokines indicates that these soluble mediators act upon a complicated network of events to provoke the disease. This cytokine storm is generally attributed to massive T cell activation as an outcome of secondary infection. However, there is reason to believe that innate immune response-derived cytokines also have contributory effects, especially in the context of severe cases of primary dengue infection. Another less popular but interesting perspective on dengue pathogenesis is the effect of mosquito feeding on host immune responses and viral infection. Various studies have shown that soluble factors from vector saliva have the capacity to alter immune reactions and thereby influence pathogen transmission and establishment. Hence, modulation of the innate immune system at various levels of infection is a critical component of dengue disease. In the absence of an approved drug or vaccine for dengue, soluble mediators of the innate immune system could be a strategic foothold for developing anti-viral therapeutics and improving clinical management.

TI  - Dengue and Zika RNA-RNA interactomes reveal pro- and anti-viral RNA in human cells
JF  - Genome Biology
VL  - 24
AB  - Background Identifying host factors is key to understanding RNA virus pathogenicity. Besides proteins, RNAs can interact with virus genomes to impact replication. Results Here, we use proximity ligation sequencing to identify virus-host RNA interactions for four strains of Zika virus (ZIKV) and one strain of dengue virus (DENV-1) in human cells. We find hundreds of coding and non-coding RNAs that bind to DENV and ZIKV viruses. Host RNAs tend to bind to single-stranded regions along the virus genomes according to hybridization energetics. Compared to SARS-CoV-2 interactors, ZIKV-interacting host RNAs tend to be downregulated upon virus infection. Knockdown of several short non-coding RNAs, including miR19a-3p, and 7SK RNA results in a decrease in viral replication, suggesting that they act as virus-permissive factors. In addition, the 3′UTR of DYNLT1 mRNA acts as a virus-restrictive factor by binding to the conserved dumbbell region on DENV and ZIKV 3′UTR to decrease virus replication. We also identify a conserved set of host RNAs that interacts with DENV, ZIKV, and SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that these RNAs are broadly important for RNA virus infection. Conclusions This study demonstrates that host RNAs can impact virus replication in permissive and restrictive ways, expanding our understanding of host factors and RNA-based gene regulation during viral pathogenesis.

TI  - Dengue and Zika Virus 5′ Untranslated Regions Harbor Internal Ribosomal Entry Site Functions
JF  - mBio
VL  - 10
AB  - Members of the genus Flavivirus of Flaviviridae are important human pathogens of great concern because they cause serious diseases, sometimes death, in human populations living in tropical, subtropical (dengue virus [DENV], Zika virus [ZIKV], and yellow fever virus), or moderate climates (West Nile virus). Flaviviruses are known to control their translation by a cap-dependent mechanism. We have observed, however, that the uncapped genomes of DENV or ZIKV can initiate infection of mammalian and insect cells. We provide evidence that the short 5′ untranslated region (5′-UTR) of DENV or ZIKV genomes can fulfill the function of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). This strategy frees these organisms from the cap-dependent mechanism of gene expression at an as yet unknown stage of proliferation. The data raise new questions about the biology and evolution of flaviviruses, possibly leading to new controls of flavivirus disease. ABSTRACT The Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family encompasses numerous enveloped plus-strand RNA viruses. Dengue virus (DENV), a flavivirus, is the leading cause of serious arthropod-borne disease globally. The genomes of DENV, like the genomes of yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile fever virus (WNV), or Zika virus (ZIKV), control their translation by a 5′-terminal capping group. Three other genera of Flaviviridae are remarkable because their viruses use internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) to control translation, and they are not arthropod transmitted. In 2006, E. Harris’ group published work suggesting that DENV RNA does not stringently need a cap for translation. They proposed that instead DENV translation is controlled by an interplay between 5′ and 3′ termini. Here we present evidence that the DENV or ZIKV 5′ untranslated regions (5′-UTRs) alone have IRES competence. This conclusion is based, first, on the observation that uncapped monocistronic mRNAs 5′ terminated with the DENV or ZIKV 5′-UTRs can efficiently direct translation of a reporter gene in BHK and C6/36 cells and second, that either 5′-UTR placed between two reporter genes can efficiently induce expression of the downstream gene in BHK cells but not in C6/36 cells. These experiments followed observations that uncapped DENV/ZIKV genomic transcripts, 5′ terminated with pppAN… or GpppAN…, can initiate infections of mammalian (BHK) or mosquito (C6/36) cells. IRES competence of the 5′-UTRs of DENV/ZIKV raises many open questions regarding the biology and control, as well as the evolution, of insect-borne flaviviruses.

TI  - Dengue and Zika Virus Capsid Proteins Contain a Common PEX19-Binding Motif
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to suppress the host immune system. For instance, flavivirus infections were found to sabotage peroxisomes, organelles with an important role in innate immunity. The current model suggests that the capsid (C) proteins of DENV and ZIKV downregulate peroxisomes, ultimately resulting in reduced production of interferons by interacting with the host protein PEX19, a crucial chaperone in peroxisomal biogenesis. Here, we aimed to explore the importance of peroxisomes and the role of C interaction with PEX19 in the flavivirus life cycle. By infecting cells lacking peroxisomes we show that this organelle is required for optimal DENV replication. Moreover, we demonstrate that DENV and ZIKV C bind PEX19 through a conserved PEX19-binding motif, which is also commonly found in cellular peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs). However, in contrast to PMPs, this interaction does not result in the targeting of C to peroxisomes. Furthermore, we show that the presence of C results in peroxisome loss due to impaired peroxisomal biogenesis, which appears to occur by a PEX19-independent mechanism. Hence, these findings challenge the current model of how flavivirus C might downregulate peroxisomal abundance and suggest a yet unknown role of peroxisomes in flavivirus biology.

TI  - Dengue and Zika virus NS4B proteins differ in topology and in determinants of ER membrane protein complex dependency
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 99
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses utilize the cellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for all aspects of their lifecycle. Genome replication and other viral activities take place in structures called replication organelles (ROs), which are invaginations induced in the ER membrane. Among the required elements for RO formation is the biogenesis of viral nonstructural proteins NS4A and NS4B. We have previously shown that NS4A and NS4B from Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) depend on the cellular ER membrane protein complex (EMC) for biogenesis. Here, we find that this dependency extends to the NS4A and NS4B proteins of Yellow Fever virus (YFV) and West Nile virus (WNV), which share similar computationally predicted membrane topologies. However, we demonstrate that ZIKV NS4B has different determinants of its dependency on the EMC than those for DENV NS4B, as well as a different membrane topology. Furthermore, we characterize mutant isolates of DENV and ZIKV that were serially passaged in EMC knockout cells and find that none are completely independent of the EMC for infection, and that mutant NS4B proteins remain sensitive to EMC depletion, suggesting a high genetic barrier to EMC depletion. Collectively, our findings are consistent with a model in which the EMC recognizes multiple determinants in the NS4B protein to support infection in several flaviviruses of critical public health importance. IMPORTANCE The NS4A and NS4B proteins of flaviviruses are critically important to replication, but little is known about their function. It has been previously reported that the cellular EMC supports the biogenesis of NS4A and NS4B from Dengue and Zika virus. In this work, we demonstrate that this dependency on the EMC for NS4A and NS4B biogenesis extends to the West Nile and Yellow Fever viruses. Furthermore, we examine the features of ZIKV NS4B and find that its membrane topology of ZIKV NS4B and its determinants of dependency on the EMC are different from those previously described in DENV NS4B. Finally, we present evidence that there is a high genetic barrier for Dengue and Zika viruses to overcome EMC depletion.

TI  - Dengue and Zika virus infection are impaired by small molecule ER proteostasis regulator 147 in an ATF6-independent manner
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Flaviviruses, including Dengue and Zika, are widespread human pathogens, however, no broadly active therapeutics exist to fight infection. Here, we establish the recently discovered pharmacologic modulator of ER proteostasis 147 as an effective host-centered antiviral strategy. Compound 147 reduces infection by attenuating viral replication without causing toxicity in host cells. 147 is a preferential activator of the ATF6 pathway of the unfolded protein response, which requires targeting of cysteine residues primarily on protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). We find that the antiviral activity of 147 is independent of ATF6 induction but does require modification of reactive thiols on protein targets. Targeting PDIs using RNAi and other PDI small molecule inhibitors was unable to recapitulate the antiviral effects, suggesting additional identified protein targets of 147 may mediate the activity. Importantly, 147 can impair infection of multiple strains of Dengue and Zika virus, indicating that it is suitable as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent.

JF  - Autophagy
VL  - 13
SP  - 322
EP  - 332
AB  - ABSTRACT The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is exploited by several diverse viruses during their infectious life cycles. Flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), utilize the ER as a source of membranes to establish their replication organelles and to facilitate their assembly and eventual maturation along the secretory pathway. To maintain normal homeostasis, host cells have evolved highly efficient processes to dynamically regulate the ER, such as through reticulophagy, a selective form of autophagy that leads to ER degradation. Here, we identify the ER-localized reticulophagy receptor FAM134B as a host cell restriction factor for both DENV and ZIKV. We show that RNAi-mediated depletion of FAM134B significantly enhances both DENV and ZIKV replication at an early stage of the viral life cycle. Consistent with its role as an antiviral host factor, we found that several flaviviruses including DENV, ZIKV, and West Nile virus (WNV), utilize their NS3 virally-encoded proteases to directly cleave FAM134B at a single site within its reticulon homology domain (RHD). Mechanistically, we show that NS3-mediated cleavage of FAM134B blocks the formation of ER and viral protein-enriched autophagosomes, suggesting that the cleavage of FAM134B serves to specifically suppress the reticulophagy pathway. These findings thus point to an important role for FAM134B and reticulophagy in the regulation of flavivirus infection and suggest that these viruses specifically target these pathways to promote viral replication.

TI  - Dengue and chikungunya virus loads in the mosquito Aedes aegypti are determined by distinct genetic architectures
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 19
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of the arboviruses dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV). These viruses exhibit key differences in their vector interactions, the latter moving more quicky through the mosquito and triggering fewer standard antiviral pathways. As the global footprint of CHIKV continues to expand, we seek to better understand the mosquito’s natural response to CHIKV—both to compare it to DENV:vector coevolutionary history and to identify potential targets in the mosquito for genetic modification. We used a modified full-sibling design to estimate the contribution of mosquito genetic variation to viral loads of both DENV and CHIKV. Heritabilities were significant, but higher for DENV (40%) than CHIKV (18%). Interestingly, there was no genetic correlation between DENV and CHIKV loads between siblings. These data suggest Ae. aegypti mosquitoes respond to the two viruses using distinct genetic mechanisms. We also examined genome-wide patterns of gene expression between High and Low CHIKV families representing the phenotypic extremes of viral load. Using RNAseq, we identified only two loci that consistently differentiated High and Low families: a long non-coding RNA that has been identified in mosquito screens post-infection and a distant member of a family of Salivary Gland Specific (SGS) genes. Interestingly, the latter gene is also associated with horizontal gene transfer between mosquitoes and the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia. This work is the first to link the SGS gene to a mosquito phenotype. Understanding the molecular details of how this gene contributes to viral control in mosquitoes may, therefore, also shed light on its role in Wolbachia.

EP  - 66
AB  - Little is known of the role of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) alleles or non-HLA alleles in determining resistance, susceptibility or the severity of acute viral infections. Dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) are suitable models for immunogenetic studies, yet only superficial efforts have been made to study dengue disease to date. DF and DHF can be caused by both primary and secondary infection by any of the four serotypes of the dengue virus. Differences in host susceptibility to infectious disease and disease severity cannot be attributed solely to the virus virulence. Variations in immune response, often associated with polymorphism in the human genome, can now be detected. Data on the influence of human genes in DF and DHF are discussed here in relation to (1) associations between HLA polymorphism and dengue disease susceptibility or resistance, (2) protective alleles influencing progression to severe disease, (3) alleles restricting CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and (4) non-HLA genetic factors that may contribute to DHF evolution. Recent discoveries regarding genetic associations in other viral infections may provide clues to understanding the development of end-stage complications in dengue disease. The scanty positive data presented here indicate a need for detailed genetic studies in different ethnic groups in different countries during the acute phase of DF and DHF on a larger number of patients.

JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease causing significant health and economic burdens globally. The dengue virus (DENV) comprises four serotypes (DENV1-4). Usually, the primary infection is asymptomatic or causes mild dengue fever (DF), while secondary infections with a different serotype increase the risk of severe dengue disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF). Complement system activation induces inflammation and tissue injury, contributing to disease pathogenesis. However, in asymptomatic or primary infections, protective immunity largely results from the complement system’s lectin pathway (LP), which is activated through foreign glycan recognition. Differences in N-glycans displayed on the DENV envelope membrane influence the lectin pattern recognition receptor (PRR) binding efficiency. The important PRR, mannan binding lectin (MBL), mediates DENV neutralization through (1) a complement activation-independent mechanism via direct MBL glycan recognition, thereby inhibiting DENV attachment to host target cells, or (2) a complement activation-dependent mechanism following the attachment of complement opsonins C3b and C4b to virion surfaces. The serum concentrations of lectin PRRs and their polymorphisms influence these LP activities. Conversely, to escape the LP attack and enhance the infectivity, DENV utilizes the secreted form of nonstructural protein 1 (sNS1) to counteract the MBL effects, thereby increasing viral survival and dissemination.

TI  - Dengue fatal cases present virus-specific HMGB1 response in peripheral organs
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Dengue is an important infectious disease that presents high incidence and yields a relevant number of fatal cases (about 20,000) every year worldwide. Despite its epidemiological relevance, there are many knowledge gaps concerning dengue pathogenesis, especially with regards to the circumstances that drive a mild clinical course to a severe disease. In this work, we investigated the participation of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), an important modulator of inflammation, in dengue fatal cases. Histopathological and ultrastructural analyses revealed that liver, lung and heart post-mortem samples were marked by tissue abnormalities, such as necrosis and apoptotic cell death. These observations go in line with an HMGB1-mediated response and raised concerns regarding the participation of this cytokine in promoting/perpetuating inflammation in severe dengue. Further experiments of immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed increased expression of cytoplasmic HMGB1 in dengue-extracted tissues when compared to non-dengue controls. Co-staining of DENV RNA and HMGB1 in the host cell cytoplasm, as found by in situ hybridization and IHC, confirmed the virus specific induction of the HMGB1-mediated response in these peripheral tissues. This report brings the first in-situ evidence of the participation of HMGB1 in severe dengue and highlights novel considerations in the development of dengue immunopathogenesis.

EP  - 9
AB  - A consecutive series of 24 patients with clinical features of primary dengue infection and 22 controls (14 patients with viral fever of unknown origin and 8 healthy subjects) were assayed for serum levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF). The acute sera of the 24 patients with clinical dengue infection were positive for dengue virus-specific IgM antibody. Clinically, 8 had dengue fever (DF), 14 dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and 2 dengue shock syndrome (DSS). All 16 patients with DHF/DSS had significantly elevated serum TNF levels but the 8 DF patients had TNF levels equivalent to that in the 22 controls. A case is made for augmented TNF production having a role for the pathophysiological changes observed in DHF/DSS and mediator modulation as a possible therapeutic approach to treatment.

TI  - Dengue haemorrhagic fever: a job done via exosomes?
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 8
SP  - 1626
EP  - 1635
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue fever is one of those unique diseases where host immune responses largely determine the pathogenesis and its severity. Earlier studies have established the fact that dengue virus (DENV) infection causes haemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome, but it is not directly responsible for exhibiting these clinical symptoms. It is noteworthy that clinically, vascular leakage syndrome does not develop for several days after infection despite a robust innate immune response that elicits the production of proinflammatory and proangiogenic cytokines. The onset of hyperpermeability in severe cases of dengue disease takes place around the time of defervescence and after clearance of viraemia. Extracellular vesicles are known to carry biological information (mRNA, miRNA, transcription factors) from their cells of origin and have emerged as a significant vehicle for horizontal transfer of stress signals. In dengue virus infection, the relevance of exosomes can be instrumental since the majority of the immune responses in severe dengue involve heavy secretion and circulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Here, we present an updated review which will address the unique and puzzling features of hyperpermeability associated with DENV infection with a special focus on the role of secreted extracellular vesicles.

TI  - Dengue induces iNOS expression and nitric oxide synthesis in platelets through IL-1R
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 13
AB  - Introduction Dengue is an arthropod-born disease caused by dengue virus (DENV), that may manifest as a mild illness or severe form, characterized by hemorrhagic fever and shock. Nitric oxide (NO) is a vasodilator signaling molecule and an inhibitor of platelet aggregation known to be increased in platelets from dengue patients. However, the mechanisms underlying NO synthesis by platelets during dengue are not yet elucidated. IL-1β is a pro-inflammatory cytokine able to induce iNOS expression in leukocytes and present in dengue patients at high levels. Nevertheless, the role of IL-1β in platelet activation, especially regarding iNOS expression, are not clear. Methods We prospectively followed a cohort of 28 dengue-infected patients to study NO synthesis in platelets and its relationship with disease outcomes. We used in vitro infection and stimulation models to gain insights on the mechanisms. Results and Discussion We confirmed that platelets from dengue patients express iNOS and produce higher levels of NO during the acute phase compared to healthy volunteers, returning to normal levels after recovery. Platelet NO production during acute dengue infection was associated with the presence of warning signs, hypoalbuminemia and hemorrhagic manifestations, suggesting a role in dengue pathophysiology. By investigating the mechanisms, we evidenced increased iNOS expression in platelets stimulated with dengue patients´ plasma, indicating induction by circulating inflammatory mediators. We then investigated possible factors able to induce platelet iNOS expression and observed higher levels of IL-1β in plasma from patients with dengue, which were correlated with NO production by platelets. Since platelets can synthesize and respond to IL-1β, we investigated whether IL-1β induces iNOS expression and NO synthesis in platelets. We observed that recombinant human IL-1β enhanced iNOS expression and dose-dependently increased NO synthesis by platelets. Finally, platelet infection with DENV in vitro induced iNOS expression and NO production, besides the secretion of both IL-1α and IL-1β. Importantly, treatment with IL-1 receptor antagonist or a combination of anti-IL-1α and anti-IL-1β antibodies prevented DENV-induced iNOS expression and NO synthesis. Our data show that DENV induces iNOS expression and NO production in platelets through mechanisms depending on IL-1 receptor signaling.

TI  - Dengue infection in mice inoculated by the intracerebral route: neuropathological effects and identification of target cells for virus replication
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 9
AB  - Dengue is an important arboviral infection, causing a broad range symptom that varies from life-threatening mild illness to severe clinical manifestations. Recent studies reported the impairment of the central nervous system (CNS) after dengue infection, a characteristic previously considered as atypical and underreported. However, little is known about the neuropathology associated to dengue. Since animal models are important tools for helping to understand the dengue pathogenesis, including neurological damages, the aim of this work was to investigate the effects of intracerebral inoculation of a neuroadapted dengue serotype 2 virus (DENV2) in immunocompetent BALB/c mice, mimicking some aspects of the viral encephalitis. Mice presented neurological morbidity after the 7th day post infection. At the same time, histopathological analysis revealed that DENV2 led to damages in the CNS, such as hemorrhage, reactive gliosis, hyperplastic and hypertrophied microglia, astrocyte proliferation, Purkinje neurons retraction and cellular infiltration around vessels in the pia mater and in neuropil. Viral tropism and replication were detected in resident cells of the brain and cerebellum, such as neurons, astrocyte, microglia and oligodendrocytes. Results suggest that this classical mice model might be useful for analyzing the neurotropic effect of DENV with similarities to what occurs in human.

TI  - Dengue infection modulates locomotion and host seeking in Aedes aegypti
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 14
AB  - Pathogens may manipulate their human and mosquito hosts to enhance disease transmission. Dengue, caused by four viral serotypes, is the fastest-growing transmissible disease globally resulting in 50–100 million infections annually. Transmission of the disease relies on the interaction between humans and the vector Aedes aegypti and is largely dependent on the odor-mediated host seeking of female mosquitoes. In this study, we use activity monitors to demonstrate that dengue virus-1 affects the locomotion and odor-mediated behavior of Ae. aegypti, reflecting the progression of infection within the mosquito. Mosquitoes 4–6 days post-infection increase locomotion, but do not alter their odor-driven host-seeking response. In contrast, females 14–16 days post-infection are less active, yet more sensitive to human odors as assessed by behavioral and electrophysiological assays. Such an increase in physiological and behavioral sensitivity is reflected by the antennal-specific increase in abundance of neural signaling transcripts in 14 days post-infection females, as determined by transcriptome analysis. This suggests that the sensitivity of the mosquito peripheral olfactory system is altered by the dengue virus by enhancing the overall neural responsiveness of the antenna, rather than the selective regulation of chemosensory-related genes. Our study reveals that dengue virus-1 enhances vector-related behaviors in the early stages post-infection that aid in avoiding predation and increasing spatial exploration. On the other hand, at the later stages of infection, the virus enhances the host-seeking capacity of the vector, thereby increasing the risk of virus transmission. A potential mechanism is discussed.

AB  - Recent observations indicate that the clinical profile of dengue virus (DENV) infection is changing, and that neurological manifestations are becoming frequent. The neuro pathogenesis of dengue, and the contribution of viral and host factors to the disease are not well understood. To define the amino acid substitutions in DENV potentially implicated in the acquisition of a neurovirulent phenotype we used a murine model to characterize two neuroadapted strains of DENV‐1, FGA/NA a5c (previously obtained), and FGA/NA P6 (recently obtained). Only three amino acid substitutions were identified in the neurovirulent strains, mapping to the E and NS3 helicase domains. These mutations enhanced the ability of neuroadapted viral strains to replicate in the CNS of infected mice, causing extensive damage with leptomeningitis and encephalitis. J. Med.

AB  - Dengue virus is an arbovirus belonging to class Flaviviridae Its clinical manifestation ranges from asymptomatic to extreme conditions (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome). A lot of research has been done on this ailment, yet there is no effective treatment available for the disease. This review provides the systematic understanding of all dengue proteins, role of its structural proteins (C‐protein, E‐protein, prM) in virus entry, assembly, and secretion in host cell, and nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5) in viral assembly, replication, and immune evasion during dengue progression and pathogenesis. Furthermore, the review has highlighted the controversies related to the only commercially available dengue vaccine, that is, Dengvaxia, and the risk associated with it. Lastly, it provides an insight regarding various approaches for developing an effective anti‐dengue treatment.

TI  - Dengue serotype-specific immune response in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus

VL  - 112
SP  - 829
EP  - 837
AB  - BACKGROUND Dengue viruses (DENV) are considered one of the most important emerging pathogens and dengue disease is a global health threat. The geographic expansion of dengue viruses has led to co-circulation of all four dengue serotypes making it imperative that new DENV control strategies be devised. OBJECTIVES Here we characterize dengue serotype-specific innate immune responses in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus using DENV from Puerto Rico (PR). METHODS Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were infected with dengue serotype 1 and 2 isolated from Puerto Rico. DENV infected mosquito samples were collected and temporal change in expression of selected innate immune response pathway genes analyzed by quantitative real time PCR. FINDINGS The Toll pathway is involved in anti-dengue response in Ae. aegypti, and Ae. albopictus. Infections with PR DENV- 1 elicited a stronger response from genes of the Toll immune pathway than PR DENV-2 in Ae. aegypti but in infected Ae. albopictus expression of Toll pathway genes tended to be similar between the serotypes. Two genes (a ribosomal S5 protein gene and a nimrod-like gene) from Ae. albopictus were expressed in response to DENV. MAIN CONCLUSIONS These studies revealed a role for antiviral genes in DENV serotype-specific interactions with DENV vectors, demonstrated that infections with DENV-2 can modulate the Toll immune response pathway in Ae. aegypti and elucidated candidate molecules that might be used to interfere with serotype specific vector-virus interactions.

These cell lines offer alternative approaches to investigating the interactions between arboviruses and other vertebrates at the cellular level. The various cell origins, types, and morphologies can be valuable resources for studying viral ecology and examining hypotheses regarding viral reservoirs. Dengue viruses (DENV) are major re-emerging pathogens that have been studied classically in only a few cell lines. Methods: We evaluated the susceptibility of 19 distinct mammalian, avian, and reptilian cell lines to DENV infection. Cell lines were infected with DENV serotypes 1–4 and evaluated for susceptibility via focus-forming unit assays and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: Both methods demonstrated the ability of DENV to replicate in 14 cell lines derived from various vertebrates with viral titers ranging from 1 × 10 to 1 × 10 infectious units per milliliter. Cell line susceptibility to DENV infection was serotype specific, with DENV-1 and DENV-4 infecting more cell lines than either DENV-2 or DENV-3. Cellular type also seemed to affect the infectivity of DENV. Human endothelial cells were only susceptible to DENV-4. Of six fibroblast lines, 100% were susceptible to at least one DENV serotype whereas only 62% of 13 epithelial lines were susceptible to DENV serotypes 1–4. Conclusion: These data indicate that a variety of cell lines from human and animal species can be used to culture DENV. The serotype-specific susceptibility for certain cell lines may provide a tool to help characterize specific DENV serotypes as well as an in vitro platform for the study of host–pathogen interactions and the co-circulation of DENV serotypes in a specific region or individual.

TI  - Dengue subgenomic RNA binds TRIM25 to inhibit interferon expression for epidemiological fitness
JF  - Science
VL  - 350
SP  - 217
EP  - 221
AB  - Orchestrating a viral takeover For some pathogenic viruses, outbreaks occur when a new viral strain emerges and displaces the endemic strain. How such a takeover occurs at a molecular level, however, remains an open question. Manokaran et al. examined one example, the emergence of a new clade of dengue virus (DENV) that caused an outbreak in Puerto Rico in 1994. The epidemic strain produced elevated amounts of subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), a viral noncoding RNA, relative to amounts of genomic viral RNA. sfRNA bound to and inhibited TRIM25, a protein important for activating the host's antiviral response, and so by reducing host immunity was able to increase its own fitness. Science, this issue p. 217 Elevated amounts of a viral noncoding RNA that suppresses host immunity likely led to an outbreak of dengue virus. The global spread of dengue virus (DENV) infections has increased viral genetic diversity, some of which appears associated with greater epidemic potential. The mechanisms governing viral fitness in epidemiological settings, however, remain poorly defined. We identified a determinant of fitness in a foreign dominant (PR-2B) DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) clade, which emerged during the 1994 epidemic in Puerto Rico and replaced an endemic (PR-1) DENV-2 clade. The PR-2B DENV-2 produced increased levels of subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) relative to genomic RNA during replication. PR-2B sfRNA showed sequence-dependent binding to and prevention of tripartite motif 25 (TRIM25) deubiquitylation, which is critical for sustained and amplified retinoic acid–inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)–induced type I interferon expression. Our findings demonstrate a distinctive viral RNA–host protein interaction to evade the innate immune response for increased epidemiological fitness.

TI  - Dengue subgenomic flaviviral RNA disrupts immunity in mosquito salivary glands to increase virus transmission
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 13
AB  - Globally re-emerging dengue viruses are transmitted from human-to-human by Aedes mosquitoes. While viral determinants of human pathogenicity have been defined, there is a lack of knowledge of how dengue viruses influence mosquito transmission. Identification of viral determinants of transmission can help identify isolates with high epidemiological potential. Additionally, mechanistic understanding of transmission will lead to better understanding of how dengue viruses harness evolution to cycle between the two hosts. Here, we identified viral determinants of transmission and characterized mechanisms that enhance production of infectious saliva by inhibiting immunity specifically in salivary glands. Combining oral infection of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and reverse genetics, we identified two 3’ UTR substitutions in epidemic isolates that increased subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) quantity, infectious particles in salivary glands and infection rate of saliva, which represents a measure of transmission. We also demonstrated that various 3’UTR modifications similarly affect sfRNA quantity in both whole mosquitoes and human cells, suggesting a shared determinism of sfRNA quantity. Furthermore, higher relative quantity of sfRNA in salivary glands compared to midgut and carcass pointed to sfRNA function in salivary glands. We showed that the Toll innate immune response was preferentially inhibited in salivary glands by viruses with the 3’UTR substitutions associated to high epidemiological fitness and high sfRNA quantity, pointing to a mechanism for higher saliva infection rate. By determining that sfRNA is an immune suppressor in a tissue relevant to mosquito transmission, we propose that 3’UTR/sfRNA sequence evolution shapes dengue epidemiology not only by influencing human pathogenicity but also by increasing mosquito transmission, thereby revealing a viral determinant of epidemiological fitness that is shared between the two hosts.

TI  - Dengue tropism for macrophages and dendritic cells: the host cell effect.
AB  - Dengue virus infects immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DC). We compared virus infectivity in macrophages and DC, and found that the virus origin determined the cell tropism of progeny virus. The highest efficiency of re-infection was seen for macrophage-derived dengue virus. Furthermore, in the presence of enhancing antibodies, macrophage-derived virus gave greater enhancement of infection compared with immature DC-derived virus. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of macrophages in dengue infection.

TI  - Dengue type 4 virus mutants containing deletions in the 3' noncoding region of the RNA genome: analysis of growth restriction in cell culture and altered viremia pattern and immunogenicity in rhesus monkeys
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 70
SP  - 3930
EP  - 3937
AB  - The dengue type 4 virus (DEN4) genome contains a 384-nucleotide (nt) 3' noncoding sequence in which the last 81 nt, predicted to form a secondary structure, are thought to be essential for virus replication. Immediately upstream of the secondary structure, short RNA sequences that are conserved among mosquito-borne flaviviruses have been identified. A series of deletions that range from 30 to 262 nt were introduced into this upstream region of full-length DEN4 cDNA to create viable deletion mutants, some of which might prove to be useful for inclusion in a live attenuated virus vaccine. When studied by an infectious-center assay, most full-length RNA transcripts of the deletion constructs exhibited reduced infectivity when transfected into simian LLC-MK2 cells compared with the full-length RNA transcripts of wild-type parental virus. Deletion mutations that extended as far as the 5' boundary of the 3' noncoding region and whose 3' boundary did not extend beyond the last 113 nt of the 3' end were viable. With the exception of mutant 3'd 303-183, which contained a deletion of nt 303 to 183 from the 3' terminus, deletion mutants produced plaques that appeared late on simian LLC-MK2 cells or exhibited a small-plaque morphology on mosquito C6/36 cells compared with the wild-type virus. These mutants also replicated less efficiently and attained a lower titer in LLC-MK2 cells than parental wild-type virus. Significantly, mutant 3'd 303-183 grew to a high titer and was least restricted in growth. Mutant 3'd 303-183 and four other moderately to severely restricted mutants were selected for evaluation of infectivity and immunogenicity in rhesus monkeys. There was a suggestion that occurrence and duration of viremia were reduced for some of the deletion mutants compared with the wild-type virus. However, more convincing evidence for attenuation of some of the mutants was provided by an analysis of antibody response to infection. Mutant 3'd 303-183 induced an antibody response equivalent to that stimulated by wild-type virus, whereas other mutants induced low to moderate levels of antibodies, as measured by radioimmunoprecipitation and virus neutralization. The immunogenicity of these 3' DEN4 deletion mutants in monkeys appeared to correlate with their efficiency of growth in simian LLC-MK2 cells. One or more mutants described in this paper may prove to be useful for immunization of humans against disease caused by dengue virus.

TI  - Dengue vascular permeability syndrome: what, no T cells?
JF  - Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America
VL  - 56 6
SP  - 900
EP  - 1
AB  - TO THE EDITOR—Tam et al found that 0.5 or 2.0 mg/kg of prednisolone administered orally for 3 consecutive days early in the course of dengue disease in Vietnamese children or adults failed to reduce subsequent abnormal hemostasis or loss of fluid from capillaries [1]. This result was greeted with dismay because an anticipated accessible and inexpensive ameliorative treatment of the dengue vascular permeability syndrome had failed, but neither the authors nor a published commentary identified the full significance of this audacious clinical trial [2]. The unusual clinical course of severe dengue permits early access to patients as illness begins with the sudden-onset fever that prompts many patients to seek medical attention. However, the abnormal hemostasis and increased vascular permeability that comprise the dengue vascular permeability syndrome occur several days after onset of fever, usually during defervescence. Thus, during dengue illnesses there is a therapeutic window for possible early intervention. The short duration of dengue vascular permeability has led most investigators to entertain the hypothesis of an underlying pharmacological mechanism, with central efforts focused on cytokines released during the elimination of dengue-infected cells [3]. As evidence of some therapeutic effect, in the Vietnam trial prednisolone slightly reversed leukopenia and aspartate aminotransferase levels, but the full immune elimination event was not altered as all patients recovered from their dengue infection uneventfully and on schedule. The steroid doses administered should have been immunosuppressive, so perhaps the dengue vascular permeability syndrome is not T cell mediated. If not, what could be the late-in-illness pathogenic mechanism? The answer may reside in an old suspect—the denguesoluble complement-fixing antigen, or nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) [4]. Recently, Lin et al have found that during the late stages of dengue disease NS1 circulates as complexes with thrombin [5]. More importantly, NS1 also forms complexes with prothrombin, resulting in a prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin times, values that have been shown to be the strongest correlate of vascular permeability in patients with dengue infection [6]. As its original name implies, NS1 interacts powerfully with the complement system, and complement activation once was recognized as an intrinsic component of the dengue vascular permeability syndrome [7, 8]. Might the release of NS1 from dengueinfected cells contribute to the late onset of the dengue shock syndrome? Studies on the virological course of dengue infections in monkeys found that peak cellular infection occurred at the end of the viremic phase [9]. If this is true for humans, then during defervescence the cell elimination immune process may release a bolus of NS1, which—still biologically active despite circulating as immune complexes—produces a NS1 toxicosis. It is well to recall that NS1 vaccines have shown protection against flavivirus disease [10]. The results of the Vietnam study surely demand a major new thrust to dengue pathogenesis research.

TI  - Dengue virus 2 capsid protein chaperones the strand displacement of 5′-3′ cyclization sequences
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 49
SP  - 5832
EP  - 5844
AB  - Abstract By virtue of its chaperone activity, the capsid protein of dengue virus strain 2 (DENV2C) promotes nucleic acid structural rearrangements. However, the role of DENV2C during the interaction of RNA elements involved in stabilizing the 5′-3′ panhandle structure of DENV RNA is still unclear. Therefore, we determined how DENV2C affects structural functionality of the capsid-coding region hairpin element (cHP) during annealing and strand displacement of the 9-nt cyclization sequence (5CS) and its complementary 3CS. cHP has two distinct functions: a role in translation start codon selection and a role in RNA synthesis. Our results showed that cHP impedes annealing between 5CS and 3CS. Although DENV2C does not modulate structural functionality of cHP, it accelerates annealing and specifically promotes strand displacement of 3CS during 5′-3′ panhandle formation. Furthermore, DENV2C exerts its chaperone activity by favouring one of the active conformations of cHP. Based on our results, we propose mechanisms for annealing and strand displacement involving cHP. Thus, our results provide mechanistic insights into how DENV2C regulates RNA synthesis by modulating essential RNA elements in the capsid-coding region, that in turn allow for DENV replication.

AB  - Abstract Flavivirus infections often provoke life-threatening diseases of epidemic magnitudes, thus extensive research is currently directed towards the development of efficient vaccines and approved antiviral compounds. We present here the expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of one of the components of the flavivirus replication complex, the non-structural protein 5 (NS5) mRNA methyltransferase (MTase) domain, from an emerging pathogenic flavivirus, dengue virus 3 (DEN3). Polycrystalline precipitates of DEN3 NS5 MTase, suitable for X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) measurements, were produced in the presence of PEG 8000 (25–32.5% (w/v)), 0.1 M Tris-Amino, in a pH range from 7.0 to 8.0. A polymorph of orthorhombic symmetry (space group: P21212, a=61.9 Å, b=189.6 Å, c=52.4 Å) was identified via XRPD. These results are the first step towards the complete structural determination of this molecule via XRPD and a parallel demonstration of the applicability of the method.

TI  - Dengue virus 3 genotype I (GI) lineage 1 (L1) isolates elicit differential cytopathic effect with syncytium formation in human glioblastoma cells (U251)
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 20
AB  - Background Dengue virus (DENV) is a Flaviviridae member classified into four antigenically distinct serotypes (DENV 1, 2, 3, and 4) and further subdivided genotypes. DENV3 is subdivided into four or five genotypes, depending on the classification adopted. Despite their high genetic proximity, as revealed by phylogenetic complete polyprotein analysis, DENV3 MG-20 and DENV3 PV_BR showed different neurovirulence in mice models. Our group identified six amino acid mutations in protein E, including the E62K and E123Q, which may affect interactions of hydrophobic clusters on domain II, thus leading to the observed differences in the studied viruses. Methods Human glioblastoma cells (U251) derived from a malignant glioblastoma tumor by explant technique were infected by the DENV3 GIL1 isolates DENV3 MG-20 and DENV3 PV_BR and analyzed by plaque assays and titration, optical, immunofluorescence, and transmission electronic microscopy. Results The two isolates showed different cytopathic effects (CPE) and fusogenic patterns, further confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence. Transmission electron microscopy revealed intense cytopathic effects in DENV3 MG-20 infected U251 cells, displaying endoplasmic reticulum hypertrophy and turgid vesicles with proteins and multiple viruses, distinct from DENV3 PV_BR infected cells. It is hypothesized that the different amino acids in the DENV3 MG-20 isolate are related to an increased membrane fusion ability in viral infection, thus facilitating immune system evasion and increased chances of central nervous system cell infection. Conclusion These results emphasize the biological differences between the isolates, which could be a critical factor in host-virus interaction and severe dengue development. Our study presents comparative results of highly similar isolates with the potential to generate more subsidies for a deeper understanding of the DENV pathogenesis. The neurotropism of the isolate DENV3 MG-20 (belonging to the DENV3 GI L1 genotype) showing infection of nervous system cells (U251) could contribute to understanding neurological dengue disease.

TI  - Dengue virus 3 genotype I shows natural changes in heparan sulphate binding sites, cell interactions, and neurovirulence in a mouse model.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 102 8
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent pathogen of the Flaviviridae family. Due to the considerable increase in DENV incidence and spread, symptoms such as CNS involvement have increased. Heparan sulphate (HS) was the first molecule identified as an adhesion factor for DENV in mammalian cells. Viral phenotypes with different HS interactions are associated with various clinical symptoms, including neurological alterations. Here, using in silico analyses, in vitro studies, and the in vivo mouse model, we characterized two natural circulating DENV3 genotype I (GI) lineage 1 (L1) in Brazil-DENV3 MG-20 (from Minas Gerais) and DENV3 PV_BR (from Rondônia) that present divergent neurovirulent profiles and sensitivity to sulphated molecules. We identified substitutions at the viral envelope (E) in positions 62 and 123 as likely responsible for the differences in neurovirulence. The E62K and E123Q substitutions in DENV3 MG-20 and DENV3 PV_BR, respectively, greatly influenced in silico electrostatic density and heparin docking results. In vivo, mice inoculated with DENV3 MG-20 died, but not those infected with DENV3 PV_BR. The clinical symptoms, such as paralysis of the lower limbs and meningoencephalitis, and histopathology, also differed between the inoculated groups. In vitro heparin and heparinases assays further demonstrated the biological impact of these substitutions. Other characteristics that have been previously associated with alterations in cell tropism and neurovirulence, such as changes in the size of lysis plaques and differences in cytopathic effects in glioblastoma cells, were also observed.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 104 7
AB  - Mosquito-borne dengue disease is caused by the dengue virus serotype-1 to serotype-4. The contemporary dengue outbreaks in the southwestern Indian ocean coincided with the widespread of dengue virus serotype 2 genotype II (Cosmopolitan), including epidemic viral strains DES-14 and RUN-18 isolated in Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) in 2014 and La Reunion Island (France) in 2018, respectively. Heterodimeric interaction between prM (intracellular precursor of surface structural M protein) and envelope E proteins is required during the initial stage of dengue virus assembly. Amino acid 127 of DES-14 prM protein (equivalent to M36) has been identified as an infrequent valine whereas RUN-18 has a common isoleucine. In the present study, we examined the effect of M-I36V mutation on the expression of a recombinant RUN-18 E protein co-expressed with prM in human epithelial A549 cells. The M ectodomain of dengue virus serotype 2 embeds a pro-apoptotic peptide referred as D2AMP. The impact of M-I36V mutation on the death-promoting capability of D2AMP was assessed in A549 cells. We showed that valine at position M36 affects expression of recombinant RUN-18 E protein and potentiates apoptosis-inducing activity of D2AMP. We propose that the nature of M residue 36 influences the virological characteristics of dengue 2 M and E proteins belonging to genotype II that contributes to global dengue burden.

AB  - The induction of apoptotic cell death is a prominent cytopathic effect of dengue (DEN) viruses. One of the key questions to be addressed is which viral components induce apoptosis in DEN virus-infected cells. This study investigated whether the small membrane (M) protein was involved in the induction of apoptosis by DEN virus. This was addressed by using a series of enhanced green fluorescent protein-fused DEN proteins. Evidence is provided that intracellular production of the M ectodomains (residues M-1 to M-40) of all four DEN serotypes triggered apoptosis in host cells such as mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2a and human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The M ectodomains of the wild-type strains of Japanese encephalitis, West Nile and yellow fever viruses also had proapoptotic properties. The export of the M ectodomain from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane appeared to be essential for the initiation of apoptosis. The study found that anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 protected HepG2 cells against the death-promoting activity of the DEN M ectodomain. This suggests that the M ectodomain exerts its cytotoxic effects by activating a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The cytotoxicity of the DEN M ectodomain reflected the intrinsic proapoptotic properties of the nine carboxy-terminal amino acids (residues M-32 to M-40) designated ApoptoM: Residue M-36 was unique in that it modulated the death-promoting activity of the M ectodomain. Defining the ApoptoM-activated signalling pathways leading to apoptosis will provide the basis for studying how the M protein might play a key role in the fate of the flavivirus-infected cells.

TI  - Dengue virus NS1 cytokine-independent vascular leak is dependent on endothelial glycocalyx components
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent, medically important mosquito-borne virus. Disease ranges from uncomplicated dengue to life-threatening disease, characterized by endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage. Previously, we demonstrated that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) induces endothelial hyperpermeability in a systemic mouse model and human pulmonary endothelial cells, where NS1 disrupts the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer. NS1 also triggers release of inflammatory cytokines from PBMCs via TLR4. Here, we examined the relative contributions of inflammatory mediators and endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways. In vivo, we demonstrated that DENV NS1 but not the closely-related West Nile virus NS1 triggers localized vascular leak in the dorsal dermis of wild-type C57BL/6 mice. In vitro, we showed that human dermal endothelial cells exposed to DENV NS1 do not produce inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8) and that blocking these cytokines does not affect DENV NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Further, we demonstrated that DENV NS1 induces vascular leak in TLR4- or TNF-α receptor-deficient mice at similar levels to wild-type animals. Finally, we blocked DENV NS1-induced vascular leak in vivo using inhibitors targeting molecules involved in glycocalyx disruption. Taken together, these data indicate that DENV NS1-induced endothelial cell-intrinsic vascular leak is independent of inflammatory cytokines but dependent on endothelial glycocalyx components.

TI  - Dengue virus NS1 hits hard at the barrier integrity of human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells via cellular microRNA dysregulations.
JF  - Tissue barriers
SP  - 2424628
EP  - 
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infections are commonly reported in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. DENV is reported to exploit various strategies to cross the blood-brain barrier. The NS1 protein of DENV plays an important role in viral neuropathogenesis, resulting in endothelial hyperpermeability and cytokine-induced vascular leak. miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that play an important role in post-transcriptional gene regulations. However, no comprehensive information about the involvement of miRNAs in DENV-NS1-mediated neuropathogenesis has been explored to date. We observed that DENV-NS1 significantly alters the cellular miRNome of human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells in a bystander fashion. Subsequent target prediction and pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these microRNAs and their corresponding target genes are involved in pathways associated with blood-brain barrier dysfunction such as "Adherens junction" and "Tight junction". Additionally, several miRNA-mRNA pairs were also found to be involved in cellular signaling pathways related to cytokine production, for instance, "Jak-STAT signaling pathway", "Chemokine signaling pathway", "IL-17 signaling pathway", "NF-κB signaling pathway", and "Viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor". The dysregulated production of inflammatory cytokines is reported to compromise BBB permeability. This study is the first report to demonstrate that DENV-NS1-mediated miRNA perturbations are crucial in compromising endothelial barrier integrity. It also offers insights into potential therapeutic targets to mitigate DENV-NS1-induced vascular permeability and inflammation.

TI  - Dengue virus NS1 leads to downregulation of HNF4 alpha in liver cells resulting in a decrease in coagulation factors I, V, X, and XIII, contributing to coagulopathy.
JF  - Journal of virology
SP  - e0141824
EP  - 
AB  - Dengue virus NS1 protein is a major pathogenic protein. In this study, we examined the role of NS1 in coagulopathy associated with Dengue infection, a common feature of Dengue virus pathogenesis. Since most coagulation factors are produced by hepatocytes and liver is key organ affected during infection, we conducted transcriptomics using total-RNA extracted from Huh7 cells overexpressing NS1 protein. Coagulation factors 1, 5, 10, and 13 were downregulated and was confirmed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot assays in both adherent and non-adherent cell culture systems across all four serotypes of Dengue. We also determined that downregulation of coagulation factors is a result of reduced expression of transcription activator HNF4α. Furthermore, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) leads to HNF4α downregulation and subsequent downregulation of coagulation factors. The downregulation of HNF4α and the downregulation of subsequent coagulation factors were validated in BALB/c mice by hydrodynamic tail vein injection of NS1 expression plasmids. Western blot assays using plasma from Dengue patients indicated that at least two coagulation factors of the common pathway of coagulation cascade are downregulated during the febrile phase, with levels improving toward the convalescent phase. NS1-mediated downregulation of coagulation factors was observed for both intracellular and secreted NS1. The hypothesis was also validated using virus infection assays. Overall, our study highlights the role of NS1 in mediating coagulopathy by modulating the expression of coagulation factors through transcriptional suppression of HNF4α by elevated phosphorylated ERK. This signaling cascade could be targeted for therapeutic intervention against virus-related coagulopathies.


IMPORTANCE
Thrombocytopenia has been linked to coagulopathy of Dengue infection, and Dengue patients with coagulopathies are often administered platelet transfusion. For coagulopathies without thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusion might not help. We demonstrated the role of NS1 in coagulopathy by downregulating coagulation factors themselves. When thrombocytopenia does not exist or when thrombocytopenia as well as reduced levels of coagulation factors are the causative factors for coagulopathies, only platelet transfusion might not be effective. Alternative strategies, like administration of coagulation factor cocktails or platelet transfusion along with coagulation factor cocktail, might be promising. Our work also leads to a signaling pathway of NS1-mediated downregulation of coagulation factors via phosphorylated ERK and HNF4α. HNF4α is a transcription regulator for many other liver-based metabolic factors and pathways like lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, etc, and thus, therapeutic targeting of NS1-based downregulation of HNF4α can lead to designing therapeutic candidates for managing other Dengue-based liver dysfunction.

AB  - Dengue virus NS1 protein induces inflammatory responses via TLR4 and disrupts endothelial cell monolayer integrity. A leak in the dike Everyone knows how mosquitos can wreck an end-of-summer picnic. But in some climates, these pesky intruders persist and carry a variety of detrimental diseases—some with no preventative vaccines or targeted therapies. One such passenger is dengue virus (DENV), which infects up to 400 million people each year and comes in several serotypes (1 to 4) and disease presentations—from mild infection to severe disease and sometimes death. But to treat or prevent dengue requires that we have a more complete picture of the disease pathology. Now, Modhiran et al. and Beatty et al. describe the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments that point to circulating dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and the innate immune Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a focus for basic scientists as well as vaccine and drug developers. DENV infection protects a patient from future reinfection with the same DENV serotype as well as producing temporary immune protection from severe dengue disease caused by a different DENV serotype. But unlike diamonds, this immune protection doesn’t last forever, and when the protected period passes, the patient becomes at increased risk of enhanced infection and progression to severe disease if he or she is infected with a second DENV serotype. This severe form of dengue infection is believed to result from immunopathogenic processes that induce cytokine storm and cause vascular leakage that leads to shock. Until now, no dengue viral proteins have been linked to vascular endothelium permeability (that is, vascular leakage). Beatty et al. show that inoculation of mice with DENV NS1 protein alone induces both vascular leak and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and that administration of NS1 with a sublethal dose of DENV2 leads to lethal vascular leak syndrome. In human endothelial cell monolayers in culture, NS1 from any of the four DENV serotypes triggered endothelial barrier permeability. NS1’s pathogenic effects were blocked by NS1-immune polyclonal mouse serum or monoclonal antibodies to NS1 (in vivo and in vitro), and immunization of mice with NS1 protected against lethal DENV2 challenge. In an independent study, Mondrian et al. explore the underlying mechanism of NS1’s effects. They show that highly purified NS1 acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that activates mouse macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in culture via TLR4, resulting in release of inflammatory cytokines—an effect that was blocked by either a TLR4 antagonist or an anti-TLR4 antibody. Then, in an in vitro model of vascular leak, the authors found that NS1 fractured the integrity of endothelial cell monolayers through a TLR4-dependent pathway, a finding that was supported by the observation that a TLR4 antagonist quelled capillary leak in a mouse model of dengue virus infection. Together, these new findings highlight NS1 as an instigator of dengue-associated vascular leak and thus pinpoint a potential target for dengue drugs and component for dengue vaccines. Complications arising from dengue virus infection include potentially fatal vascular leak, and severe disease has been linked with excessive immune cell activation. An understanding of the triggers of this activation is critical for the development of appropriately targeted disease control strategies. We show here that the secreted form of the dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). Highly purified NS1 devoid of bacterial endotoxin activity directly activated mouse macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), leading to the induction and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In an in vitro model of vascular leak, treatment with NS1 alone resulted in the disruption of endothelial cell monolayer integrity. Both NS1-mediated activation of PBMCs and NS1-induced vascular leak in vitro were inhibited by a TLR4 antagonist and by anti-TLR4 antibody treatment. The importance of TLR4 activation in vivo was confirmed by the reduction in capillary leak by a TLR4 antagonist in a mouse model of dengue virus infection. These results pinpoint NS1 as a viral toxin counterpart of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Similar to the role of LPS in septic shock, NS1 might contribute to vascular leak in dengue patients, which highlights TLR4 antagonists as a possible therapeutic option.

TI  - Dengue virus NS1 protein conveys pro‐inflammatory signals by docking onto high‐density lipoproteins
JF  - EMBO reports
VL  - 23
AB  - The dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a secreted virulence factor that modulates complement, activates immune cells and alters endothelial barriers. The molecular basis of these events remains incompletely understood. Here we describe a functional high affinity complex formed between NS1 and human high‐density lipoproteins (HDL). Collapse of the soluble NS1 hexamer upon binding to the lipoprotein particle leads to the anchoring of amphipathic NS1 dimeric subunits into the HDL outer layer. The stable complex can be visualized by electron microscopy as a spherical HDL with rod‐shaped NS1 dimers protruding from the surface. We further show that the assembly of NS1‐HDL complexes triggers the production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines in human primary macrophages while NS1 or HDL alone do not. Finally, we detect NS1 in complex with HDL and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) particles in the plasma of hospitalized dengue patients and observe NS1‐apolipoprotein E‐positive complexes accumulating overtime. The functional reprogramming of endogenous lipoprotein particles by NS1 as a means to exacerbate systemic inflammation during viral infection provides a new paradigm in dengue pathogenesis.

TI  - Dengue virus NS1 secretion is regulated via importin-subunit β1 controlling expression of the chaperone GRp78 and targeted by the clinical drug ivermectin
JF  - mBio
VL  - 14
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a major human pathogen. An important pathogenicity factor is non-structural protein 1 (NS1) required for viral replication and secreted from infected cells. A clinical study indicated that the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin lowers NS1 blood levels without affecting viremia. Ivermectin targets nuclear transport by binding to importin-α, but how NS1 secretion in patients is suppressed by this drug is unknown. We show that ivermectin impairs folding and secretion of endoplasmic reticulum-luminal glycoproteins, including NS1. Proteomic analysis identified chaperones interacting with NS1, including GRp78 (78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, also known as HSPA5 or BIP). This chaperone increased in abundance on DENV infection via activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Ivermectin blocked the nuclear transport of transcription factors required for UPR, thus impairing GRp78 upregulation and NS1 secretion. Reduction of GRp78 and NS1 secretion was also observed in patients treated with ivermectin. These results link nuclear transport and its inhibition by ivermectin to folding and secretion of luminal glycoproteins, including DENV NS1. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is a major human pathogen that can cause hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. One important factor of DENV pathogenicity is non-structural protein 1 (NS1), a glycoprotein that is secreted from infected cells. Here we study the mode of action of the widely used drug ivermectin, used to treat parasitic infections and recently shown to lower NS1 blood levels in DENV-infected patients. We found that ivermectin blocks the nuclear transport of transcription factors required for the expression of chaperones that support the folding and secretion of glycoproteins, including NS1. Impairing nuclear transport of these transcription factors by ivermectin or depleting them from infected cells dampens NS1 folding and thus its secretion. These results reveal a novel mode of action of ivermectin that might apply to other flaviviruses as well.

However, no viral proteins have been directly implicated in triggering endothelial permeability, which results in vascular leakage. DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted and circulates in patients’ blood during acute infection; high levels of NS1 are associated with severe disease. We show that inoculation of mice with DENV NS1 alone induces both vascular leakage and production of key inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, simultaneous administration of NS1 with a sublethal dose of DENV2 results in a lethal vascular leak syndrome. We also demonstrate that NS1 from DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 triggers endothelial barrier dysfunction, causing increased permeability of human endothelial cell monolayers in vitro. These pathogenic effects of physiologically relevant amounts of NS1 in vivo and in vitro were blocked by NS1-immune polyclonal mouse serum or monoclonal antibodies to NS1, and immunization of mice with NS1 from DENV1 to DENV4 protected against lethal DENV2 challenge. These findings add an important and previously overlooked component to the causes of dengue vascular leak, identify a new potential target for dengue therapeutics, and support inclusion of NS1 in dengue vaccines.

TI  - Dengue virus NS4B interacts with NS3 and dissociates it from single-stranded RNA.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 87 Pt 9
SP  - 2605
EP  - 14
AB  - Dengue virus, a member of the family Flaviviridae of positive-strand RNA viruses, has seven non-structural proteins: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5. Except for enzymic activities contained within NS3 and NS5, the roles of the other proteins in virus replication and pathogenesis are not well defined. In this study, a physical interaction between NS4B and the helicase domain of NS3 was identified by using a yeast two-hybrid assay. This interaction was further confirmed by biochemical pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays, both with purified proteins and with dengue virus-infected cell lysates. NS4B co-localized with NS3 in the perinuclear region of infected human cells. Furthermore, NS4B dissociated NS3 from single-stranded RNA and consequently enhanced the helicase activity of NS3 in an in vitro unwinding assay. These results suggest that NS4B modulates dengue virus replication via its interaction with NS3.

TI  - Dengue virus NS4B protein as a target for developing antivirals
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus is an important pathogen affecting global population while no specific treatment is available against this virus. Effort has been made to develop inhibitors through targeting viral nonstructural proteins such as NS3 and NS5 with enzymatic activities. No potent inhibitors entering clinical studies have been developed so far due to many challenges. The genome of dengue virus encodes four membrane-bound nonstructural proteins which do not possess any enzymatic activities. Studies have shown that the membrane protein-NS4B is a validated target for drug discovery and several NS4B inhibitors exhibited antiviral activities in various assays and entered preclinical studies.. Here, we summarize the recent studies on dengue NS4B protein. The structure and membrane topology of dengue NS4B derived from biochemical and biophysical studies are described. Function of NS4B through protein-protein interactions and some available NS4B inhibitors are summarized. Accumulated studies demonstrated that cell-based assays play important roles in developing NS4B inhibitors. Although the atomic structure of NS4B is not obtained, target-based drug discovery approach become feasible to develop NS4B inhibitors as recombinant NS4B protein is available.

TI  - Dengue virus NS5 degrades ERC1 during infection to antagonize NF-kB activation
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 120
AB  - Significance Dengue places a huge burden to public health systems. More than forty percent of the human population is at risk of developing dengue fever or dengue hemorrhagic fever. Pathogenesis and disease severity of dengue are associated with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. In this study, we identified a dengue virus mechanism to limit cytokine secretion during infection. Studying viral–host interactions, we found an additional function of the viral protein NS5 in antagonizing immune signaling and limiting proinflammatory cytokine production in a dengue virus serotype-specific manner. This work reveals a mechanism critical for dengue virus pathogenesis and provides important information for improving tetravalent live attenuated vaccines.

TI  - Dengue virus NS5 inhibits interferon-alpha signaling by blocking signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 phosphorylation.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 200 8
SP  - 1261
EP  - 70
AB  - Type I interferons (interferon [IFN]-alpha/beta) are key mediators of innate antiviral responses. Inhibition of IFN-mediated signal transduction by dengue viruses (DENVs), mosquito-borne flaviviruses of immense global health importance, probably plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of the virus-host interaction. Understanding the molecular basis of IFN antagonism by DENV would therefore provide critical insight into disease pathogenesis and new opportunities for development of antiviral therapies and rationally attenuated vaccines. Here we examine the effects of expression of DENV nonstructural proteins on cellular IFN responses. We show that expression of nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) alone inhibits IFN-alpha, but not IFN-gamma, signaling. Expression of the polymerase domain of NS5 is sufficient to inhibit IFN-alpha signaling. NS5 binds signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) and inhibits its phosphorylation. NS5 alone did not, however, induce degradation of STAT2, which occurs when all nonstructural proteins are expressed together. We conclude that DENV NS5 is a potent and specific type I IFN antagonist.

TI  - Dengue virus and the complement alternative pathway.
JF  - FEBS letters
AB  - Dengue disease is an inflammatory driven pathology and complement overactivation is linked to disease severity and vascular leakage. Additionally, dysregulation of complement alternative pathway (AP) components has been described, such as upregulation of complement factor D and downregulation of complement factor H (FH), which activate and inhibit the AP, respectively. Thus, the pathology of severe dengue could in part result from AP dysfunction, even though complement and AP activation usually provide protection against viral infections. In dengue virus-infected macrophages and endothelial cells (EC), the site of replication and target for vascular pathology respectively, the AP is activated. The AP activation, reduced FH and vascular leakage seen in dengue disease in part parallels other complement AP pathologies associated with FH deficiency, such as atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). aHUS can be therapeutically targeted with inhibitors of complement terminal activity, raising the idea that strategies such as inhibition of complement or delivery of FH or other complement regulatory components to EC may be beneficial to combat the vascular leakage seen in severe dengue.

TI  - Dengue virus and the host innate immune response
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 7
AB  - Abstract Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus that is endemic in many tropical and sub-tropical countries where the transmission vectors Aedes spp. mosquitoes resides. There are four serotypes of the virus. Each serotype is antigenically different, meaning they elicit heterologous antibodies. Infection with one serotype will create neutralizing antibodies to the serotype. Cross-protection from other serotypes is not long term, instead heterotypic infection can cause severe disease. This review will focus on the innate immune response to DENV infection and the virus evasion of the innate immune system by escaping recognition or inhibiting the production of an antiviral state. Activated innate immune pathways includes type I interferon, complement, apoptosis, and autophagy, which the virus can evade or exploit to exacerbate disease. It is important to understand out how the immune system reacts to infection and how the virus evades immune response in order to develop effective antivirals and vaccines.

TI  - Dengue virus binding and replication by platelets.
JF  - Blood
VL  - 126 3
SP  - 378
EP  - 85
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes ∼200 million cases of severe flulike illness annually, escalating to life-threatening hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome in ∼500,000. Although thrombocytopenia is typical of both mild and severe diseases, the mechanism triggering platelet reduction is incompletely understood. As a probable initiating event, direct purified DENV-platelet binding was followed in the current study by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and confirmed antigenically. Approximately 800 viruses specifically bound per platelet at 37°C. Fewer sites were observed at 25°C, the blood bank storage temperature (∼350 sites), or 4°C, known to attenuate virus cell entry (∼200 sites). Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and heparan sulfate proteoglycan were implicated as coreceptors because only the combination of anti-DC-SIGN and low-molecular-weight heparin prevented binding. Interestingly, at 37°C and 25°C, platelets replicated the positive sense single-stranded RNA genome of DENV by up to ∼4-fold over 7 days. Further time course experiments demonstrated production of viral NS1 protein, which is known to be highly antigenic in patient serum. The infectivity of DENV intrinsically decayed in vitro, which was moderated by platelet-mediated generation of viable progeny. This was shown using a transcription inhibitor and confirmed by freeze-denatured platelets being incapable of replicating the DENV genome. For the first time, these data demonstrate that platelets directly bind DENV saturably and produce infectious virus. Thus, expression of antigen encoded by DENV is a novel consideration in the pathogen-induced thrombocytopenia mechanism. These results furthermore draw attention to the possibility that platelets may produce permissive RNA viruses in addition to DENV.

TI  - Dengue virus capsid anchor modulates the efficiency of polyprotein processing and assembly of viral particles.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
AB  - The assembly and secretion of flaviviruses are part of an elegantly regulated process. During maturation, the viral polyprotein undergoes several co- and post-translational cleavages mediated by both viral and host proteases. Among these, sequential cleavage at the N and C termini of the hydrophobic capsid anchor (Ca) is crucial in deciding the fate of viral infection. Here, using a refined dengue pseudovirus production system, along with cleavage and furin inhibition assays, immunoblotting and secondary structure prediction analysis, we show that Ca plays a key role in the processing efficiency of dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) structural proteins and viral particle assembly. Replacement of the DENV2 Ca with the homologous regions from West nile or Zika viruses or, alternatively, increasing its length, improved cleavage and hence particle assembly. Further, we showed that substitution of the Ca conserved proline residue (P110) to alanine abolishes pseudovirus production, regardless of the Ca sequence length. Besides providing the results of a biochemical analysis of DENV2 structural polyprotein processing, this study also presents a system for efficient production of dengue pseudoviruses.

TI  - Dengue virus co-opts innate type 2 pathways to escape early control of viral replication
JF  - Communications Biology
VL  - 5
AB  - Mast cell products and high levels of type 2 cytokines are associated with severe dengue disease. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are type-2 cytokine-producing cells that are activated by epithelial cytokines and mast cell-derived lipid mediators. Through ex vivo RNAseq analysis, we observed that ILC2 are activated during acute dengue viral infection, and show an impaired type I-IFN signature in severe disease. We observed that circulating ILC2 are permissive for dengue virus infection in vivo and in vitro, particularly when activated through prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). ILC2 underwent productive dengue virus infection, which was inhibited through CRTH2 antagonism. Furthermore, exogenous IFN-β induced expression of type I-IFN responsive anti-viral genes by ILC2. PGD2 downregulated type I-IFN responsive gene and protein expression; and urinary prostaglandin D2 metabolite levels were elevated in severe dengue. Moreover, supernatants from activated ILC2 enhanced monocyte infection in a GM-CSF and mannan-dependent manner. Our results indicate that dengue virus co-opts an innate type 2 environment to escape early type I-IFN control and facilitate viral dissemination. PGD2 downregulates type I-IFN induced anti-viral responses in ILC2. CRTH2 antagonism may be a therapeutic strategy for dengue-associated disease. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells are activated during acute dengue viral infection in human, downregulate type I-IFN responsive gene and protein expression through Prostaglandin D2, and are permissive for productive dengue viral infection.

TI  - Dengue virus dominates lipid metabolism modulations in Wolbachia-coinfected Aedes aegypti
JF  - Communications Biology
VL  - 3
AB  - Competition between viruses and Wolbachia for host lipids is a proposed mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking in insects. Yet, the metabolomic interaction between virus and symbiont within the mosquito has not been clearly defined. We compare the lipid profiles of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes bearing mono- or dual-infections of the Wolbachia wMel strain and dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3). We found metabolic signatures of infection-induced intracellular events but little evidence to support direct competition between Wolbachia and virus for host lipids. Lipid profiles of dual-infected mosquitoes resemble those of DENV3 mono-infected mosquitoes, suggesting virus-driven modulation dominates over that of Wolbachia. Interestingly, knockdown of key metabolic enzymes suggests cardiolipins are host factors for DENV3 and Wolbachia replication. These findings define the Wolbachia-DENV3 metabolic interaction as indirectly antagonistic, rather than directly competitive, and reveal new research avenues with respect to mosquito × virus interactions at the molecular level. Koh, Islam, Ye et al. describe lipid profiles of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes bearing mono- or dual-infections of Wolbachia (wMel) and dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3), finding that virus modulation dominates the dual-infection lipid profile and that cardiolipins support DENV3 and Wolbachia replication. This study suggests that direct competition for lipids do not underlie Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking.

TI  - Dengue virus downregulates TNFR1- and TLR3-stimulated NF-κB activation by targeting RIPK1
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most prevalent arthropod-borne virus disease and is endemic in more than 100 countries. Several DENV proteins have been shown to target crucial human host proteins to evade innate immune responses and establish a productive infection. Here we report that the DENV NS3 protein targets RIPK1 (Receptor Interacting Protein Kinase I), a central mediator of inflammation and cell death, and decreases intracellular RIPK1 levels during DENV infection. The interaction of NS3 with RIPK1 results in the inhibition of NF-κB activation in response to TNFR or TLR3 stimulation. Also, we observed that the effects of NS3 on RIPK1 were independent of NS3 protease activity. Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which DENV suppresses normal cellular functions to evade host innate immune responses

AB  - ABSTRACT  Dengue virus (DENV) is the etiological agent of the most important human viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes in the world. In spite of the serious health threat that dengue represents, at present there are no vaccine or antiviral agents available and treatment of patients consists of supportive therapy. This review will focus on the process of DENV entry into the host cell as a potential target for antiviral therapy. The recent advances in the knowledge of viral and cellular molecules and mechanisms involved in binding, internalization and trafficking of DENV into the host cell until virion uncoating are discussed, together with an overview of the strategies and compounds evaluated for development of antiviral agents targeted to DENV entry.

TI  - Dengue virus entry into liver (HepG2) cells is independent of hsp90 and hsp70
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 79
AB  - Recently, several stress‐related proteins including GRP78, hsp70, and hsp90 have been implicated as dengue virus receptors in various cell types, with hsp90/70 being implicated as a receptor complex in monocytes and macrophages, while GRP78 has been implicated as a liver cell expressed dengue virus receptor. To assess whether the hsp90/70 complex plays a role in the internalization of the dengue viruses into liver cells, we undertook infection inhibition studies with lipopolysaccharide and antibodies directed against both hsp70 and hsp90, individually and in combination. No inhibition of any dengue serotype was seen in the presence of lipopolysaccharide or antibodies directed against either hsp70 or hsp90 either singly or in combination. A moderate inhibition of dengue virus serotype 2 entry into liver cells was observed in the presence of antibodies directed against GRP78. These results confirm a proposed role for GRP78 as a dengue virus serotype 2 receptor protein and suggest that the recently identified hsp90/70 complex does not play a role in dengue virus internalization into liver cells.

TI  - Dengue virus envelope glycoprotein structure: New insight into its interactions during viral entry
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 100

EP  - 6901
AB  - Amajor step in understanding the molecular interactions that lead to entry of enveloped viruses into their target cells is obtaining structural information on the viral surface glycoproteins at the atomic level. In addition to carrying the main antigenic determinants of the virus, these proteins are responsible for the major steps involved in the entry process, which involve receptor recognition and fusion between viral and cellular membranes. A huge step forward in the field was made >20 years ago, when the laboratories of Don Wiley and John Skehel obtained the crystal structure of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) (1), which carries both receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions. Since then, the x-ray structures of relatively few soluble ectodomains of viral glycoproteins have been determined, compared to the exponential increase of protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank in the same period. In particular, structural information on viral envelope proteins combining both receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions is very scarce. Over the years, only the structures of the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) flavivirus major envelope (E) protein (2) and of the influenza C virus HA-esterase glycoprotein (3) were added to the database. In this issue of PNAS, Modis et al. (4) report the crystal structure of the E protein from dengue virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for the highest rate of disease and mortality among members of this viral genus. This structure is therefore a very important addition to the current repertoire.

Dengue virus is the most important arthropod-borne human pathogen. The incidence of dengue fever epidemics has increased dramatically over the last few decades (5), and it is estimated that up to 100 million cases occur annually. In addition, a severe form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), has emerged in the same period causing ≈ 500,000 cases worldwide each year …

TI  - Dengue virus exploits autophagy vesicles and secretory pathways to promote transmission by human dendritic cells
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 15
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), transmitted by infected mosquitoes, is a major public health concern, with approximately half the world’s population at risk for infection. Recent decades have increasing incidence of dengue-associated disease alongside growing frequency of outbreaks. Although promising progress has been made in anti-DENV immunizations, post-infection treatment remains limited to non-specific supportive treatments. Development of antiviral therapeutics is thus required to limit DENV dissemination in humans and to help control the severity of outbreaks. Dendritic cells (DCs) are amongst the first cells to encounter DENV upon injection into the human skin mucosa, and thereafter promote systemic viral dissemination to additional human target cells. Autophagy is a vesicle trafficking pathway involving the formation of cytosolic autophagosomes, and recent reports have highlighted the extensive manipulation of autophagy by flaviviruses, including DENV, for viral replication. However, the temporal profiling and function of autophagy activity in DENV infection and transmission by human primary DCs remains poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrate that mechanisms of autophagosome formation and extracellular vesicle (EV) release have a pro-viral role in DC-mediated DENV transmission. We show that DENV exploits early-stage canonical autophagy to establish infection in primary human DCs. DENV replication enhanced autophagosome formation in primary human DCs, and intrinsically-heightened autophagosome biogenesis correlated with relatively higher rates of DC susceptibility to DENV. Furthermore, our data suggest that viral replication intermediates co-localize with autophagosomes, while productive DENV infection introduces a block at the late degradative stages of autophagy in infected DCs but not in uninfected bystander cells. Notably, we identify for the first time that approximately one-fourth of DC-derived CD9/CD81/CD63+ EVs co-express canonical autophagy marker LC3, and demonstrate that DC-derived EV populations are an alternative, cell-free mechanism by which DCs promote DENV transmission to additional target sites. Taken together, our study highlights intersections between autophagy and secretory pathways during viral infection, and puts forward autophagosome accumulation and viral RNA-laden EVs as host determinants of DC-mediated DENV infection in humans. Host-directed therapeutics targeting autophagy and exocytosis pathways thus have potential to enhance DC-driven resistance to DENV acquisition and thereby limit viral dissemination by initial human target cells following mosquito-to-human transmission of DENV.

TI  - Dengue virus exploits the host tRNA epitranscriptome to promote viral replication
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The 40-50 RNA modifications of the epitranscriptome regulate posttranscriptional gene expression. Here we show that flaviviruses hijack the host tRNA epitranscriptome to promote expression of pro-viral proteins, with tRNA-modifying ALKBH1 acting as a host restriction factor in dengue virus infection. Early in the infection of human Huh-7 cells, ALKBH1 and its tRNA products 5-formylcytidine (f5C) and 2’-O-methyl-5-formylcytidine (f5Cm) were reduced. ALKBH1 knockdown mimicked viral infection, but caused increased viral NS3 protein levels during infection, while ALKBH1 overexpression reduced NS3 levels and viral replication, and increased f5C and f5Cm. Viral NS5, but not host FTSJ1, increased f5Cm levels late in infection. Consistent with reports of impaired decoding of leucine UUA codon by f5Cm-modified tRNALeu(CAA), ALKBH1 knockdown induced translation of UUA-deficient transcripts, most having pro-viral functions. Our findings support a dynamic ALKBH1/f5Cm axis during dengue infection, with virally-induced remodeling of the proteome by tRNA reprogramming and codon-biased translation.

TI  - Dengue virus genomic variation associated with mosquito adaptation defines the pattern of viral non-coding RNAs and fitness in human cells
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 13
AB  - The Flavivirus genus includes a large number of medically relevant pathogens that cycle between humans and arthropods. This host alternation imposes a selective pressure on the viral population. Here, we found that dengue virus, the most important viral human pathogen transmitted by insects, evolved a mechanism to differentially regulate the production of viral non-coding RNAs in mosquitos and humans, with a significant impact on viral fitness in each host. Flavivirus infections accumulate non-coding RNAs derived from the viral 3’UTRs (known as sfRNAs), relevant in viral pathogenesis and immune evasion. We found that dengue virus host adaptation leads to the accumulation of different species of sfRNAs in vertebrate and invertebrate cells. This process does not depend on differences in the host machinery; but it was found to be dependent on the selection of specific mutations in the viral 3’UTR. Dissecting the viral population and studying phenotypes of cloned variants, the molecular determinants for the switch in the sfRNA pattern during host change were mapped to a single RNA structure. Point mutations selected in mosquito cells were sufficient to change the pattern of sfRNAs, induce higher type I interferon responses and reduce viral fitness in human cells, explaining the rapid clearance of certain viral variants after host change. In addition, using epidemic and pre-epidemic Zika viruses, similar patterns of sfRNAs were observed in mosquito and human infected cells, but they were different from those observed during dengue virus infections, indicating that distinct selective pressures act on the 3’UTR of these closely related viruses. In summary, we present a novel mechanism by which dengue virus evolved an RNA structure that is under strong selective pressure in the two hosts, as regulator of non-coding RNA accumulation and viral fitness. This work provides new ideas about the impact of host adaptation on the variability and evolution of flavivirus 3’UTRs with possible implications in virulence and viral transmission.

TI  - Dengue virus induces PCSK9 expression to alter antiviral responses and disease outcomes
JF  - The Journal of Clinical Investigation
VL  - 130
SP  - 5223
EP  - 5234
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection requires cholesterol as a proviral factor, although statin treatment did not show antiviral efficacy in patients with dengue. Here, we show that DENV infection manipulated cholesterol metabolism in cells residing in low-oxygen microenvironments (hypoxia) such as in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. DENV infection induced expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which reduces low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) recycling and hence cholesterol uptake. We found that, whereas LDLR uptake would have distributed cholesterol throughout the various cell compartments, de novo cholesterol synthesis enriched this lipid in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). With cholesterol enrichment in the ER, ER-resident STING and type I IFN (IFN) activation was repressed during DENV infection. Our in vitro findings were further supported by the detection of elevated plasma PCSK9 levels in patients with dengue with high viremia and increased severity of plasma leakage. Our findings therefore suggest that PCSK9 plays a hitherto unrecognized role in dengue pathogenesis and that PCSK9 inhibitors could be a suitable host-directed treatment for patients with dengue.

EP  - 8
AB  - INTRODUCTION
Dengue is a human disease caused by a virus with the same name, which is transmitted by the bite of Aedes mosquitoes. The infection has a wide range of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic to fatal cases, with the pediatric population being the most susceptible. According to the new classification of the disease, the neurological manifestations are considered a criterion for the diagnosis of severe dengue. 


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the possible mechanisms involved in the onset of neurological signs in a cell line of human neurons as a model of infection with dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). 


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Susceptibility and permissiveness of the SH-SY5Y line to infection by DENV-2 was analyzed, showing that the proportions of viral infection and production are similar to those of primate cells used as positive control for infection. 


RESULTS
Infection induced a cytopathic effect on the neuroblastoma line characterized by apoptotic cell death process, increasing the proportion of annexin V and TUNEL positive cells and an upregulation of TNF-α. Treatment with anti-TNF-α antibody increased slightly cell survival of infected cells. The addition of exogenous TNF-α to the infected cultures enhanced cell death. 


CONCLUSION
These results as a whole suggest that the upregulation of TNF-α could be part of the process that induces cell damage and death in cases of dengue encephalitis.

JF  - Viral immunology
VL  - 23 6
SP  - 557
EP  - 65
AB  - The pathogenic mechanism of dengue virus infection is related to the host responses within target cells, and therefore we assessed intracellular changes in stress proteins following dengue virus infection. This study provides evidence that Hsp70 helps in viral multiplication by suppressing the type 1 interferon response. Dengue virus infection in human monocytic THP-1 cells led to overexpression of Hsp70, which also acts as a chaperone. The functional role of Hsp70 in dengue virus multiplication was identified by downregulating the Hsp70 gene with its specific siRNA duplexes, which led to a decrease in viral RNA copy numbers in cellular supernatants and intracellular viral load. It also resulted in an increased IFN-α level, which mediates its antiviral effect through double-stranded RNA-induced protein kinase-PKR. Collectively these results suggest that an increased level of Hsp70 expression in dengue-virus-infected THP-1 cells assists in viral replication by escaping the antiviral effect of type 1 interferon.

TI  - Dengue virus infection alters post-transcriptional modification of microRNAs in the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 5
AB  - Recent discoveries regarding the importance of isomiRs have increased our understanding of the regulatory complexities of the miRNAome. Observed changes in the miRNA profiles in mosquitoes infected with flaviviruses have implicated small RNAs in the interactions between viruses and their vectors. Here we analysed the isomiR profiles of both uninfected and infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the major human pathogen dengue virus (DENV). We found that several specific isomiRs were significantly altered in their abundance patterns in response to DENV infection potentially affecting their target repertoire. Notable among these were isomiR variants which displayed arm-switching. We also demonstrate that modifications to the 3p end of miRNAs are vastly more prevalent than those at the 5p ends. We also observed that in only 45% of Ae. aegypti miRNAs the most abundant read matches the exact sequence reported in miRBase. Further, we found positive correlations between the number of mature miRNA reads, pre-miRNA length, GC content and secondary structure minimum free energy with the number of isomiRs. The findings presented here provide some evidence that isomiR production is not a random phenomenon and may be important in DENV replication in its vector.

TI  - Dengue virus infection elicits highly polarized CX3CR1+ cytotoxic CD4+ T cells associated with protective immunity
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 112
SP  - E4256
EP  - E4263
AB  - Significance Infections with any of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV 1–4) are the most prevalent and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral infections in humans. There is no treatment or vaccine currently available. We found that the virus-specific cells display a highly polarized cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with expression of a protective HLA DR allele. Although the occurrence of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in humans has been described in the context of some chronic viral infections, to our knowledge, this is the first report of ex vivo cytotoxic CD4+ activity after exposure with an acute virus. These results will help shed light on the specific role of CD4+ T cells in DENV infection and may help in finding a correlate of protection. Dengue virus (DENV) is a rapidly spreading pathogen with unusual pathogenesis, and correlates of protection from severe dengue disease and vaccine efficacy have not yet been established. Although DENV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses have been extensively studied, the breadth and specificity of CD4+ T-cell responses remains to be defined. Here we define HLA-restricted CD4+ T-cell epitopes resulting from natural infection with dengue virus in a hyperepidemic setting. Ex vivo flow-cytometric analysis of DENV-specific CD4+ T cells revealed that the virus-specific cells were highly polarized, with a strong bias toward a CX3CR1+ Eomesodermin+ perforin+ granzyme B+ CD45RA+ CD4 CTL phenotype. Importantly, these cells correlated with a protective HLA DR allele, and we demonstrate that these cells have direct ex vivo DENV-specific cytolytic activity. We speculate that cytotoxic dengue-specific CD4+ T cells may play a role in the control of dengue infection in vivo, and this immune correlate may be a key target for dengue virus vaccine development.

TI  - Dengue virus infection induced NF-κB-dependent macrophage migration inhibitory factor production
JF  - American Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 4
SP  - 22
EP  - 31
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) infection can cause mild dengue fever or severe dengue hemorrhage fever and dengue shock syndrome. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a cytokine that plays an important role in the modulation of inflammatory and immune responses and serum levels of MIF are correlated with disease severity in dengue patients. However, the mechanism that induces MIF production during DV infection is unclear. In this study, we showed that DV infection, but not UVinactivated DV stimulation, dose-and time-dependently induced MIF secretion in human A649 epithelial cells. MIF promoter assays and RT-PCR demonstrated that MIF gene transcription was activated during DV infection. Furthermore, DV infection induced NF-IoB activation, and the NF-IoB inhibitors dexamethasone and curcumin inhibited DV-induced MIF production. Finally, we found that different cells have different abilities to release MIF after DV infection. Interestingly, DV infection and MIF production in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells increased in the presence of antibodies against DV. Taken together, these results suggest that DV infection of human cells induces NF-IoB activation and MIF production, which can be increased in the presence of pre-existing antibodies.

TI  - Dengue virus infection induces autophagy: an in vivo study
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 20
AB  - We and others have reported that autophagy is induced by dengue viruses (DVs) in various cell lines, and that it plays a supportive role in DV replication. This study intended to clarify whether DV infection could induce autophagy in vivo. Furthermore, the effect of DV induced autophagy on viral replication and DV-related pathogenesis was investigated. The physiopathological parameters were evaluated after DV2 was intracranially injected into 6-day-old ICR suckling mice. Autophagy-related markers were monitored by immunohistochemical/immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. Double-membrane autophagic vesicles were investigated by transmission-electron-microscopy. DV non-structural-protein-1 (NS1) expression (indicating DV infection) was detected in the cerebrum, medulla and midbrain of the infected mice. In these infected tissues, increased LC3 puncta formation, LC3-II expression, double-membrane autophagosome-like vesicles (autophagosome), amphisome, and decreased p62 accumulation were observed, indicating that DV2 induces the autophagic progression in vivo. Amphisome formation was demonstrated by colocalization of DV2-NS1 protein or LC3 puncta and mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR, endosome marker) in DV2-infected brain tissues. We further manipulated DV-induced autophagy by the inducer rapamycin and the inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3MA), which accordingly promoted or suppressed the disease symptoms and virus load in the brain of the infected mice. We demonstrated that DV2 infection of the suckling mice induces autophagy, which plays a promoting role in DV replication and pathogenesis.

TI  - Dengue virus infection induces chromatin remodeling at locus AAEL006536 in the midgut of Aedes aegypti.
JF  - Salud publica de Mexico
VL  - 60 1
SP  - 41
EP  - 47
AB  - OBJECTIVE
To identify and characterize Aedes aegypti's AAEL006536 gene proximal upstream cis-regulatory sequences activated by dengue virus infection.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. aegypti Rockefeller strain mosquitoes were blood fed or infected with dengue virus 2. Open chromatinprofiling was then carried out in pools of midguts from each group of mosquitoes.


RESULTS
The proximal upstream region does not contain open chromatin sites in the midguts of blood-fed mosquitoes as detected by FAIRE-qPCR. In contrast, two cis-regulatory sites were identified in the same upstream region of dengue virus-infected mosquito midguts. The distal sequence contains STAT-, REL- and C/EBP-type transcription factor binding sites.


CONCLUSIONS
The activation of two proximal cis-regulatory sequences, induced by dengue virus infection, is mediated by chromatin remodeling mechanisms. Binding sites suggest a dengue virus infectioninduced participation of immunity transcription factors in the up-regulation of this gene. This suggests the participation of the AAEL006536 gene in the mosquito's antiviral innate immune response.

TI  - Dengue virus infection induces complement factor H but protein remains cell-associated, with changes intracellularly and in cell surface binding
JF  - Exploration of Immunology
AB  - Aim: Severe dengue is correlated with a decrease in the circulating complement regulator, factor H (FH) and prior work has shown that dengue virus (DENV) infection induces FH mRNA but not FH protein release. Here, the mechanisms of this phenomenon were defined.
Methods: HEK293 cells were infected with DENV-2 and changes in FH mRNA and protein were analyzed by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and fluorescent microscopy. Additionally, cells were stimulated with size fractionated supernatants from DENV-infected cells, supernatant containing DENV non-structural protein-1 (NS1) without virus particles, and infections performed with or without the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) antagonist, TAK-242. Mass spectrometry was used to define the protein content of the fractionated supernatant, and treatment of cells with sialidase or heparinase was used to define cell-associated FH protein.
Results: DENV-infection induced full-length FH mRNA and cell-associated FH protein. Microscopy demonstrated membrane and intracellular-associated FH with a cytoskeletal and perinuclear localisation, in both DENV positive and uninfected neighboring bystander cells. Fractionation of cultured supernatant from DENV-infected cells demonstrated that secreted factors > 50 (kilodaltons) kDa induced FH mRNA and this could be blocked with TAK-242 but was not simulated by the TLR4 agonist, DENV NS1. Mass spectrometry detected DENV envelope, membrane and NS1, complement component 5 (C5), and complement FB, and indicated a > 20-fold increase in C4, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2 (ITIH2), and alpha-2-macroglobulin in the > 50 kDa fraction from DENV-infected compared with conditioned media from uninfected cells. Sialic acid levels were unchanged and cleavage did not affect release of FH from DENV-infected compared to uninfected cells. In contrast, sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were reduced in the cultured supernatant and cell lysates following DENV-infection, and heparinase cleavage released significantly more FH from DENV-compared with uninfected cells.
Conclusions: Following DENV-infection, secreted molecules induce FH that remains intracellular and with increased binding to cell surface heparan sulphate. The mediators of induction of FH mRNA act in trans and via TLR4 but this is not likely to be via DENV NS1. The retention of FH in the local environment of the infected cell could benefit the virus by negating local complement killing of cells, and/or benefit the host by inhibition of heparan sulphate-mediated DENV infection to restrict viral spread.

TI  - Dengue virus infection induces interferon-lambda1 to facilitate cell migration
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 6
AB  - A marked increase in the rate of dengue virus (DENV) infection has resulted in more than 212 deaths in Taiwan since the beginning of 2015, mostly from fatal outcomes such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The pathogenic mechanisms of these fatal manifestations are poorly understood. Cytokines induce an overwhelming immune reaction and thus have crucial roles. Interferon-lambda (IFN-λ), a newly identified IFN subtype, has antiviral effects, but its immunologic effects in DENV infection have not been investigated. In the present study, we show that DENV infection preferentially induced production of IFN-λ1 in human dendritic cells (DCs) and human lung epithelial cells. Virus nonstructural 1 (NS1) glycoprotein was responsible for the effect. DENV-induced production of IFN-λ1 was dependent on signaling pathways involving toll-like receptor (TLR)-3, interferon regulation factor (IRF)-3, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB). Blocking interaction between IFN-λ1 and its receptor IFN-λR1 through siRNA interference reduced DENV-induced DC migration towards the chemoattractants CCL19 and CCL21, by inhibiting CCR7 expression. Furthermore, IFN-λ1 itself induced CCR7 expression and DC migration. Our study presents the first evidence of the mechanisms and effects of IFN-λ1 induction in DENV-infected DCs and highlights the role of this cytokine in the immunopathogenesis of DENV infection.

TI  - Dengue virus infection induces selective expansion of Vγ4 and Vγ6TCR γδ T cells in the small intestine and a cytokine storm driving vascular leakage in mice
JF  - PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 17
AB  - Dengue is a major health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. Some patients develop a severe form of dengue, called dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can be fatal. Severe dengue is associated with a transient increase in vascular permeability. A cytokine storm is thought to be the cause of the vascular leakage. Although there are various research reports on the pathogenic mechanism, the complete pathological process remains poorly understood. We previously reported that dengue virus (DENV) type 3 P12/08 strain caused a lethal systemic infection and severe vascular leakage in interferon (IFN)-α/β and γ receptor knockout mice (IFN-α/β/γRKO mice), and that blockade of TNF-α signaling protected mice. Here, we performed transcriptome analysis of liver and small intestine samples collected chronologically from P12/08-infected IFN-α/β/γRKO mice in the presence/absence of blockade of TNF-α signaling and evaluated the cytokine and effector-level events. Blockade of TNF-α signaling mainly protected the small intestine but not the liver. Infection induced the selective expansion of IL-17A-producing Vγ4 and Vγ6 T cell receptor (TCR) γδ T cells in the small intestine, and IL-17A, together with TNF-α, played a critical role in the transition to severe disease via the induction of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and particularly the excess production of IL-6. Infection also induced the infiltration of neutrophils, as well as neutrophil collagenase/matrix metalloprotease 8 production. Blockade of IL-17A signaling reduced mortality and suppressed the expression of most of these cytokines, including TNF-α, indicating that IL-17A and TNF-α synergistically enhance cytokine expression. Blockade of IL-17A prevented nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 in stroma-like cells and epithelial cells in the small intestine but only partially prevented recruitment of immune cells to the small intestine. This study provides an overall picture of the pathogenesis of infection in individual mice at the cytokine and effector levels.

TI  - Dengue virus infection modifies mosquito blood-feeding behavior to increase transmission to the host
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 119
AB  - Significance Because dengue viruses are spread by mosquitoes during biting, transmission capacity depends on mosquito-biting behavior. For this reason, it is critical to understand how infection in mosquitoes influences biting. To answer this question, we deployed a multidisciplinary approach including high-resolution, multivariate biting behavior monitoring on mice, in vivo transmission assay, and mathematical modeling. We demonstrated that infected mosquitoes are more attracted to mice and bite more often to get the same amount of blood as uninfected mosquitoes. While the effect of increased attraction to host on transmission capacity is trivial, we showed that increased number of bites results in successive transmission. Eventually, we calculated that the infection-induced behavior changes tripled transmission capacity of mosquitoes. Mosquito blood-feeding behavior is a key determinant of the epidemiology of dengue viruses (DENV), the most-prevalent mosquito-borne viruses. However, despite its importance, how DENV infection influences mosquito blood-feeding and, consequently, transmission remains unclear. Here, we developed a high-resolution, video-based assay to observe the blood-feeding behavior of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes on mice. We then applied multivariate analysis on the high-throughput, unbiased data generated from the assay to ordinate behavioral parameters into complex behaviors. We showed that DENV infection increases mosquito attraction to the host and hinders its biting efficiency, the latter resulting in the infected mosquitoes biting more to reach similar blood repletion as uninfected mosquitoes. To examine how increased biting influences DENV transmission to the host, we established an in vivo transmission model with immuno-competent mice and demonstrated that successive short probes result in multiple transmissions. Finally, to determine how DENV-induced alterations of host-seeking and biting behaviors influence dengue epidemiology, we integrated the behavioral data within a mathematical model. We calculated that the number of infected hosts per infected mosquito, as determined by the reproduction rate, tripled when mosquito behavior was influenced by DENV infection. Taken together, this multidisciplinary study details how DENV infection modulates mosquito blood-feeding behavior to increase vector capacity, proportionally aggravating DENV epidemiology. By elucidating the contribution of mosquito behavioral alterations on DENV transmission to the host, these results will inform epidemiological modeling to tailor improved interventions against dengue.

EP  - 7
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection of human endothelial cells has been implicated in the pathobiology of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. However, the mechanisms by which DENV infections alter the functional physiology of endothelial cells remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we examined the susceptibility of a human liver sinusoidal endothelial cell line SK Hep1 to all four serotypes of DENV and studied the effect of the virus on in vitro angiogenesis. All four serotypes of DENV could infect the SK Hep1 cells, but showed variable cytopathic effects, the most pronounced being that of DENV-2. Electron microscopy of the infected cells showed significant ultrastructural changes. In vitro angiogenesis assays on DENV-2 exposed SK Hep1 cells in the matrigel system showed inhibition compared with the controls. Importantly, transfection and transient expression of the DENV-2 envelope glycoprotein (E) in these cells showed drastic alterations in cell shapes and the E protein could be localized by fluorescence microscopy in terminal knob-like structures. Therefore, SK Hep1, a human hepatic sinusoid-derived endothelial cell line, may constitute a potential model to study DENV-endothelial cell interactions in vitro, especially towards understanding the possible virus-induced changes in hepatic endothelium and its role in disease pathogenesis.

JF  - Journal of immunology
VL  - 161 11
SP  - 6338
EP  - 46
AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) are severe complications of secondary dengue virus (DV) infection. Vascular leakage, hemorrhagic diathesis and complement activation are the hallmarks of the disease. The short-lived nature of the plasma leakage syndrome has led to the conclusion that altered permeability is most likely effected by a soluble mediator. In the present study, we show that infection of human endothelial cells with DV induces the transcriptional up-regulation and secretion of RANTES and IL-8 and, in the presence of anti-dengue Abs, the formation of nonlytic complement complexes. Extremely high levels of IL-8 were detected in plasma and pleural fluid samples from patients with DSS. Furthermore, DV infection of endothelial cells in vitro caused apoptosis. Complement activation, chemokine induction, and apoptotic cell death may act in concert to cause the fulminant but short-lived vascular leakage that is characteristic of DHF/DSS.

TI  - Dengue virus infection of human microvascular endothelial cells from different vascular beds promotes both common and specific functional changes
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 78
AB  - Dengue shock syndrome (DSS), the major life threatening outcome of severe dengue disease, which occurs in some patients in the course of dengue infection, is the consequence of plasma leakage in the microvascular territories. Data from clinical and in vitro studies suggest that an inadequate immunological response is partly responsible for the pathophysiology of DSS, but few is known concerning the consequences of direct infection of endothelial cells by dengue virus per se. In this study, an attempt was made to study the response of two microvascular human cell lines originating, respectively, from liver and dermis to infection by a dengue type 2 virus, by analyzing the virus‐induced modulation of functional markers. It is shown that the two microvascular cell lines exhibit both common and specific behaviors upon infection. In particular, LSEC and HMEC‐1 replicate efficiently the low‐passage virus and respond to infection by over‐producing inflammatory mediators involved in the cross talk with circulating immune cells. However, direct infection modulates differently the cell surface expression of molecules critically involved in the interactions between endothelial and inflammatory cells. ICAM‐1 and HLA‐I are up regulated as a consequence of infection in LSEC whereas direct infection results in downregulation of ICAM‐1 in HMEC‐1. The present results show that infection of human microvascular cells by unadapted dengue virus results in both common and specific activation patterns depending likely on the tissue origin of the cells, thus suggesting that endothelia from different territories may contribute differently to the pathophysiological events in the course of dengue infection.

AB  - High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein functions in regulation of transcription, cellular activation and pro-inflammatory responses. However, the potential role of HMGB1 during viral infection has not been investigated. This study attempted to elucidate whether the HMGB1-mediated inflammatory response contributes to the pathogenesis of dengue virus (DENV) infection. Our data showed that HMGB1 was released at low DENV infection levels (m.o.i. of 1) under non-necrotic conditions by human dendritic cells (DCs). When DENV-infected DCs were co-cultured with autologous T cells, there was increased production of HMGB1 by both cell types. HMGB1 regulated tumour necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and alpha interferon secretion in DENV-infected DCs. Additionally, increased HMGB1 production was associated with reduced DENV replication titres in DCs. These results suggest that HMGB1 production influences DENV infection in susceptible hosts.

TI  - Dengue virus infection: current concepts in immune mechanisms and lessons from murine models
JF  - Immunology
VL  - 141
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV), a group of four serologically distinct but related flaviviruses, are responsible for one of the most important emerging viral diseases. This mosquito‐borne disease has a great impact in tropical and subtropical areas of the world in terms of illness, mortality and economic costs, mainly due to the lack of approved vaccine or antiviral drugs. Infections with one of the four serotypes of DENV (DENV‐1–4) result in symptoms ranging from an acute, self‐limiting febrile illness, dengue fever, to severe dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. We reviewed the existing mouse models of infection, including the DENV‐2‐adapted strain P23085. The role of CC chemokines, interleukin‐17 (IL‐17), IL‐22 and invariant natural killer T cells in mediating the exacerbation of disease in immune‐competent mice is highlighted. Investigations in both immune‐deficient and immune‐competent mouse models of DENV infection may help to identify key host–pathogen factors and devise novel therapies to restrain the systemic and local inflammatory responses associated with severe DENV infection.

AB  - In this study dengue virus (DV) was found to infect primary endothelial cells derived from human umbilical cord veins (HUVEC) and alter their cytokine production. Dengue virus infection of HUVEC was confirmed by an increase in plaque-forming units in the culture supernatant and by immunofluorescence assay. HUVEC produced large amounts of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 but not IL-1beta after DV infection. Both the replication of DV and the production of IL-6 and IL-8 by HUVEC after DV infection were inhibited by ribavirin, an antiviral synthetic guanosine analogue. Additionally, increased serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were observed in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever but not dengue fever. Therefore, our results suggest that endothelial cells can be a target for DV infection, and that DV-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production by endothelial cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever.

AB  - Dengue fever is a mosquitoborne viral illness caused by 4 dengue viruses (DENV-1-4). The cellular tropism of DENV has not been definitively determined, despite its importance for understanding viral pathogenesis and identifying therapeutic targets. To define DENV cellular tropism in a small animal model, 129/Pas mice lacking interferon-alpha/beta and/or-gamma receptors were infected with DENV via a subcutaneous route. During the first week after infection, virus was present in lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and circulating white blood cells. F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ dendritic cells were demonstrated to be targets for DENV-2 infection in the spleen by flow cytometry directed to structural and nonstructural DENV proteins and by magnetic bead separation followed by strand-specific reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We find that the initial cellular tropism of DENV in mice is similar to that reported in humans, thereby paving the way for investigation of cellular tropism and pathogenesis of DENV in primary and secondary infections.

TI  - Dengue virus infects the mouse eye following systemic or intracranial infection and induces inflammatory responses.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is associated with clinical ocular presentations and here DENV infection of the eye was assessed in mice. In an AG129 mouse model of antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection, DENV RNA was detected in the eye and vascular changes were present in the retinae. Intraocular CD8 and IFN-γ mRNA were increased in mice born to DENV-naïve, but not DENV-immune mothers, while TNF-α mRNA was induced and significantly higher in mice born to DENV-immune than DENV-naïve mothers. DENV RNA was detected in the eye following intracranial DENV infection and CD8 mRNA but not IFN-γ nor TNF-α were induced. In all models, viperin was increased following DENV infection. Thus, DENV in the circulation or the brain can infect the eye and stimulate innate immune responses, with induction of viperin as one response that consistently occurs in multiple DENV eye-infection models in both an IFN-dependent and independent manner.

TI  - Dengue virus neither directly mediates hyperpermeability nor enhances tumor necrosis factor-α-induced permeability in vitro.
JF  - Japanese journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 67 2
SP  - 86
EP  - 94
AB  - The mechanisms of endothelial barrier dysfunction in dengue disease remain poorly understood. Endothelial cell (EC) death due to virus infection or in combination with an infection-induced cytokine storm is deemed as one of the major causes of plasma leakage. Using an in vitro model of human endothelia and several dengue virus (DENV) strains (including a clinical isolate), the direct consequence of infection on endothelial permeability was investigated throughout the course of the infection. All employed DENV-2 strains were able to infect and replicate in ECs. Rather than increase endothelial permeability, DENV infection alone enhanced cell barrier integrity up to 7 days postinfection. Improved cell barrier function was mediated by type I interferon activation at the early phase of infection and by the survival advantage of the infected cells at the late phase of infection. Consistent with this phenomenon, DENV infection did not augment tumor necrosis factor-α-induced permeability. Our results prove that DENV infection does not directly account for vascular permeability; DENV neither induces hyperpermeability nor exacerbates the permeabilizing effect of cytokines. The contributory role of other factors on plasma leakage during dengue disease warrants further investigation.

TI  - Dengue virus non-structural protein 1 activates the p38 MAPK pathway to decrease barrier integrity in primary human endothelial cells.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes an estimated 390 million infections worldwide annually, with severe forms of disease marked by vascular leakage. Endothelial cells (EC) are directly responsible for vascular homeostasis and are highly responsive to circulating mediators but are not commonly infected. DENV encodes seven non-structural (NS) proteins; with only one of those, NS1, secreted from infected cells and accumulating in the blood of patients. NS1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular permeability, but the mechanism is not completely understood. Here we used primary endothelial cells and an array of in vitro approaches to study the effect of NS1 in disease-relevant human ECs. Confocal microscopy demonstrated rapid NS1 internalization by ECs into endosomes with accumulation over time. Transcriptomic and pathway analysis showed significant changes in functions associated with EC homeostasis and vascular permeability. Functional significance of this activation was assessed by trans-endothelial electrical resistance and showed that NS1 induced rapid and transient loss in EC barrier function within 3 h post-treatment. To understand the molecular mechanism by which NS1 induced EC activation, we evaluated the stress-sensing p38 MAPK pathway known to be directly involved in EC permeability and inflammation. WB analysis of NS1-stimulated ECs showed clear activation of p38 MAPK and downstream effectors MAPKAPK-2 and HSP27 with chemical inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase pathway restoring barrier function. Our results suggest that DENV NS1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe dengue by activating the p38 MAPK in ECs, promoting increased permeability that characterizes severe disease.

TI  - Dengue virus non-structural protein 1 disrupts the TGF-β/Smad signaling 
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - 
 TGF-β signaling is tightly regulated to ensure cellular functions. Role of DENV on the TGF-β/Smad signaling has not been well established. Therefore, we aimed to study the association between DENV infection and TGF-β/Smad signaling. We observed significant impairment in the expression of Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, Smad6 and Smad7 during DENV replication, which are the key players in TGF-β signaling. Significant reduction in the expression of phosphorylated Smad3 was also documented. Overexpression of Smad2/3/4/6 provided the evidence of slight inhibition on DENV replication indicating these Smads may work against the establishment of DENV replication. DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) was noted as crucial viral factor that impaired the expression of Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 and also physically interacts with these proteins as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assay. Additionally, we observed NS1 is also capable of blocking the nuclear translocation of Smad3 and thus further ensuring inhibition of Smad signaling. To figure out degradation mechanisms, we studied the role of two distinct E3 ligases, CHIP and Smurf2, which are essential for the degradation of Smad proteins. Co-expression of Smad2/3/4 and NS1 with Smurf2, Smurf2mut, CHIP or use of CHIP-/- cells suggests that only Smurf2 has significant role in the degradation of Smad proteins during DENV infection. NS1 may acts as a co-factor with Smurf2 to escalate the proteasome and lysosome mediated degradation of Smad3 and Smad4 proteins respectively. Therefore, our results confirm that NS1 interacts with Smad proteins and reduces their expression by utilizing E3 ligase and disrupt the TGF-β/Smad signaling.

TI  - Dengue virus non-structural protein 3 inhibits mitochondrial respiration by impairing complex I function
JF  - mSphere
VL  - 9
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infection is known to affect host cell metabolism, but the molecular players involved are still poorly known. Using a proteomics approach, we identified six DENV proteins associated with mitochondria isolated from infected hepatocytes, and most of the peptides identified were from NS3. We also found an at least twofold decrease of several electron transport system (ETS) host proteins. Thus, we investigated whether NS3 could modulate the ETS function by incubating recombinant DENV NS3 constructs in mitochondria isolated from mouse liver. We found that NS3pro (NS3 protease domain), but not the correspondent catalytically inactive mutant (NS3proS135A), impairs complex I (CI)-dependent NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity, but not the activities of complexes II, III, IV, or V. Accordingly, using high-resolution respirometry, we found that both NS3pro and full-length NS3 decrease the respiratory rates associated with malate/pyruvate oxidation in mitochondria. The NS3-induced impairment in mitochondrial respiration occurs without altering either leak respiration or mitochondria’s capacity to maintain membrane potential, suggesting that NS3 does not deeply affect mitochondrial integrity. Remarkably, CI activity is also inhibited in DENV-infected cells, supporting that the NS3 effects observed in isolated mitochondria may be relevant in the context of the infection. Finally, in silico analyses revealed the presence of potential NS3 cleavage sites in 17 subunits of mouse CI and 16 subunits of human CI, most of them located on the CI surface, suggesting that CI is prone to undergo proteolysis by NS3. Our findings suggest that DENV NS3 can modulate mitochondrial bioenergetics by directly affecting CI function. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a major public health problem worldwide, affecting about 400 million people yearly. Despite its importance, many molecular aspects of dengue pathogenesis remain poorly known. For several years, our group has been investigating DENV-induced metabolic alterations in the host cells, focusing on the bioenergetics of mitochondrial respiration. The results of the present study reveal that the DENV non-structural protein 3 (NS3) is found in the mitochondria of infected cells, impairing mitochondrial respiration by directly targeting one of the components of the electron transport system, the respiratory complex I (CI). NS3 acts as the viral protease during the DENV replication cycle, and its proteolytic activity seems necessary for inhibiting CI function. Our findings uncover new nuances of DENV-induced metabolic alterations, highlighting NS3 as an important player in the modulation of mitochondria function during infection.

TI  - Dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 activates platelets via Toll-like receptor 4, leading to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 15
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection, the most common mosquito-transmitted viral infection, can cause a range of diseases from self-limiting dengue fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Thrombocytopenia is a major characteristic observed in both mild and severe dengue disease and is significantly correlated with the progression of dengue severity. Previous studies have shown that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), which can be secreted into patients’ blood, can stimulate immune cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and can cause endothelial leakage. However, it is unclear whether DENV NS1 can directly induce platelet activation or cause thrombocytopenia during DENV infection. In this study, we first demonstrated that DENV but not Zika virus cell culture supernatant could induce P-selectin expression and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in human platelets, both of which were abolished when NS1 was depleted from the DENV supernatant. Similar results were found using recombinant NS1 from all four serotypes of DENV, and those effects were blocked in the presence of anti-NS1 F(ab’)2, anti-TLR4 antibody, a TLR4 antagonist (Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipopolysaccharide, LPS-Rs) and a TLR4 signaling inhibitor (TAK242), but not polymyxin B (an LPS inhibitor). Moreover, the activation of platelets by DENV NS1 promoted subthreshold concentrations of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation and enhanced platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and phagocytosis by macrophages. Finally, we demonstrated that DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR4 knockout and wild-type mice when NS1 was depleted from DENV supernatant. Taken together, these results suggest that the binding of DENV NS1 to TLR4 on platelets can trigger its activation, which may contribute to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage during dengue infection.

AB  - Dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is expressed on the surface of infected cells and is a target of human antibody responses to dengue virus infection. We show here that dengue virus uses the cellular glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage pathway to express a GPI-anchored form of NS1 and that GPI anchoring imparts a capacity for signal transduction in response to binding of NS1-specific antibody. This study is the first to identify GPI linkage of a virus-encoded protein. The GPI anchor addition signal for NS1 was identified, by transfection of HeLa cells with dengue cDNA constructs, as a downstream hydrophobic domain in NS2A. GPI linkage of NS1 in both transfected and infected cells was demonstrated by cleavage of NS1 from the surface by PI-specific phospholipase C and by metabolic incorporation of the GPI-specific components ethanolamine and inositol. In common with other GPI-anchored proteins, addition of specific antibody resulted in signal transduction, as evidenced by tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Antibody-induced signal transduction by GPI-linked NS1 suggests a mechanism of cellular activation that may contribute to the pathogenesis of human dengue disease. Signal transduction by a GPI-anchored viral antigen interacting with a specific antibody that it induces is a new concept in the pathogenesis of viral disease.

TI  - Dengue virus nonstructural protein 3 redistributes fatty acid synthase to sites of viral replication and increases cellular fatty acid synthesis

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) modifies cellular membranes to establish its sites of replication. Although the 3D architecture of these structures has recently been described, little is known about the cellular pathways required for their formation and expansion. In this report, we examine the host requirements for DENV replication using a focused RNAi analysis combined with validation studies using pharmacological inhibitors. This approach identified three cellular pathways required for DENV replication: autophagy, actin polymerization, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Further characterization of the viral modulation of fatty acid biosynthesis revealed that a key enzyme in this pathway, fatty acid synthase (FASN), is relocalized to sites of DENV replication. DENV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) is responsible for FASN recruitment, inasmuch as (i) NS3 expressed in the absence of other viral proteins colocalizes with FASN and (ii) NS3 interacts with FASN in a two-hybrid assay. There is an associated increase in the rate of fatty acid biosynthesis in DENV-infected cells, and de novo synthesized lipids preferentially cofractionate with DENV RNA. Finally, purified recombinant NS3 stimulates the activity of FASN in vitro. Taken together, these experiments suggest that DENV co-opts the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway to establish its replication complexes. This study provides mechanistic insight into DENV membrane remodeling and highlights the potential for the development of therapeutics that inhibit DENV replication by targeting the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway.

TI  - Dengue virus nonstructural protein 5 adopts multiple conformations in solution.
JF  - Biochemistry
VL  - 51 30
SP  - 5921
EP  - 31
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is composed of two globular domains separated by a 10-residue linker. The N-terminal domain participates in the synthesis of a mRNA cap 1 structure ((7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)) at the 5' end of the viral genome and possesses guanylyltransferase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase, and nucleoside-2'O-methyltransferase activities. The C-terminal domain is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for viral RNA synthesis. Although crystal structures of the two isolated domains have been obtained, there are no structural data for full-length NS5. It is also unclear whether the two NS5 domains interact with each other to form a stable structure in which the relative orientation of the two domains is fixed. To investigate the structure and dynamics of DENV type 3 NS5 in solution, we conducted small-angle X-ray scattering experiments with the full-length protein. NS5 was found to be monomeric and well-folded under the conditions tested. The results of these experiments also suggest that NS5 adopts multiple conformations in solution, ranging from compact to more extended forms in which the two domains do not seem to interact with each other. We interpret the multiple conformations of NS5 observed in solution as resulting from weak interactions between the two NS5 domains and flexibility of the linker in the absence of other components of the replication complex.

AB  - A transient increase in trans-endothelial cell permeability in dengue patients leads to vascular leakage and shock syndrome. Here, we analysed the molecular mechanisms that cause permeability changes in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) using a direct dengue virus (DENV) infection model or treatment with NS1, a secreted DENV non-structural protein. In HMEC-1 cells, both treatments increase permeability with a concordant increase in the secretion of angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2). There is phosphorylation and loss of the junction protein VE-Cadherin from the inter-endothelial cell junctions and phosphorylation of RhoA. Direct virus infection results in activation of Src by phosphorylation, whereas NS1 treatment alone does not lead to Src activation. Furthermore, treatment with recombinant Ang-1, a physiological antagonist of Ang-2, prevents Ang-2 release, VE-Cadherin phosphorylation and internalization, and phosphorylation of RhoA and Src, resulting in restoration of barrier function. The permeability increase could also be prevented by blocking the Ang1/2 signalling receptor, Tie-2, or using a Rho/ROCK-specific inhibitor. Dasatinib, a Src-family kinase (SFK) inhibitor that inhibits Src phosphorylation, prevents enhanced permeability induced by direct DENV infection whereas in NS1 protein-treated cells its effect is less significant. The results provide important insights on the mechanisms of increased trans-endothelial permeability in DENV infection, and suggest the therapeutic potential of using recombinant Ang-1 or targeting these key molecules to prevent vascular leakage in dengue.

TI  - Dengue virus pathogenesis and host molecular machineries
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 31
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) are positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family. DENV is the causative agent of dengue, the most rapidly spreading viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. Each year, millions of people contract the virus through bites from infected female mosquitoes of the Aedes species. In the majority of individuals, the infection is asymptomatic, and the immune system successfully manages to control virus replication within a few days. Symptomatic individuals may present with a mild fever (Dengue fever or DF) that may or may not progress to a more critical disease termed Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or the fatal Dengue shock syndrome (DSS). In the absence of a universally accepted prophylactic vaccine or therapeutic drug, treatment is mostly restricted to supportive measures. Similar to many other viruses that induce acute illness, DENV has developed several ways to modulate host metabolism to create an environment conducive to genome replication and the dissemination of viral progeny. To search for new therapeutic options, understanding the underlying host-virus regulatory system involved in various biological processes of the viral life cycle is essential. This review aims to summarize the complex interaction between DENV and the host cellular machinery, comprising regulatory mechanisms at various molecular levels such as epigenetic modulation of the host genome, transcription of host genes, translation of viral and host mRNAs, post-transcriptional regulation of the host transcriptome, post-translational regulation of viral proteins, and pathways involved in protein degradation.

TI  - Dengue virus preferentially uses human and mosquito non-optimal codons
JF  - Molecular Systems Biology
VL  - 20
SP  - 1085
EP  - 1108
AB  - Codon optimality refers to the effect codon composition has on messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and translation level and implies that synonymous codons are not silent from a regulatory point of view. Here, we investigated the adaptation of virus genomes to the host optimality code using mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV) as a model. We defined which codons are associated with unstable and stable (non-optimal and optimal codons, respectively) mRNAs in mosquito cells and showed that DENV preferentially uses non-optimal codons and avoids codons that are defined as optimal in either human or mosquito cells. Human genes enriched in the codons preferentially and frequently used by DENV are up-regulated during infection, and so is the tRNA decoding the non-optimal and DENV preferentially used codon for arginine. We found that synonymous mutations towards DENV’s preferred non-optimal codons (e.g., AGA) increase fitness of DENV during serial passaging in human or mosquito cells. Finally, our analyses revealed that hundreds of viruses preferentially use non-optimal codons, with those infecting a single host displaying an even stronger bias, suggesting that synonymous codon choice is a key aspect of host-pathogen interaction.

AB  - Dengue virus is an arthropod-borne virus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue virus causes fever and hemorrhagic disorders in humans and non-human primates. Direct interaction of the virus introduced by a mosquito bite with host receptor molecule(s) is crucial for virus propagation and the pathological progression of dengue diseases. Therefore, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between dengue virus and its receptor(s) in both humans and mosquitoes is essential for an understanding of dengue pathology. In addition, understanding the molecular mechanism(s) of virus entry is crucial for the development of effective new therapies to treat dengue patients. Binding of dengue virus to its receptor molecules is mediated through a viral envelope glycoprotein, termed E protein. We present a summary and describe the structures, binding properties, and pathological relevance of dengue virus receptor molecules proposed to date. In mammalian cells, there are many candidate molecules that may act as receptors, such as sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), lectins that recognize carbohydrates, glycosphingolipid (GSL), proteins with chaperone activity, laminin-binding proteins, and other uncharacterized proteins. There are also several lines of evidence for receptor molecules such as GSLs, proteins with chaperone activity, laminin-binding proteins, and other uncharacterized proteins in mosquito cells and organs. This review focuses on several molecules involved in carbohydrate-dependent binding of the virus.

TI  - Dengue virus reduces AGPAT1 expression to alter phospholipids and enhance infection in Aedes aegypti
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 15
AB  - More than half of the world population is at risk of dengue virus (DENV) infection because of the global distribution of its mosquito vectors. DENV is an envelope virus that relies on host lipid membranes for its life-cycle. Here, we characterized how DENV hijacks the mosquito lipidome to identify targets for novel transmission-blocking interventions. To describe metabolic changes throughout the mosquito DENV cycle, we deployed a Liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) workflow including spectral similarity annotation in cells, midguts and whole mosquitoes at different times post infection. We revealed a major aminophospholipid reconfiguration with an overall early increase, followed by a reduction later in the cycle. We phylogenetically characterized acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT) enzyme isoforms to identify those that catalyze a rate-limiting step in phospholipid biogenesis, the acylation of lysophosphatidate to phosphatidate. We showed that DENV infection decreased AGPAT1, but did not alter AGPAT2 expression in cells, midguts and mosquitoes. Depletion of either AGPAT1 or AGPAT2 increased aminophospholipids and partially recapitulated DENV-induced reconfiguration before infection in vitro. However, only AGPAT1 depletion promoted infection by maintaining high aminophospholipid concentrations. In mosquitoes, AGPAT1 depletion also partially recapitulated DENV-induced aminophospholipid increase before infection and enhanced infection by maintaining high aminophospholipid concentrations. These results indicate that DENV inhibition of AGPAT1 expression promotes infection by increasing aminophospholipids, as observed in the mosquito’s early DENV cycle. Furthermore, in AGPAT1-depleted mosquitoes, we showed that enhanced infection was associated with increased consumption/redirection of aminophospholipids. Our study suggests that DENV regulates aminophospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, by inhibiting AGPAT1 expression to increase aminophospholipid availability for virus multiplication.

TI  - Dengue virus reduces expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 to facilitate replication in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 9
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of a number of viruses pathogenic to humans including dengue virus (DENV). DENV infection leads to widespread transcriptomic and proteomic alterations in mosquito cells. Here we identified alterations to the mosquito cell secretome during DENV infection by performing liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We found that an extracellular fragment of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) was present during infection. Previous literature suggests that LRP-1 regulates cholesterol homeostasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that DENV modifies LRP-1 protein expression to maintain host-derived intracellular cholesterol, which would facilitate virus replication within membrane-associated replication compartments. Accordingly, stimuli that are present during flavivirus infection reduced LRP-1 protein expression. We also found that dsRNA knockdown of LRP-1 increased intracellular cholesterol and DENV viral RNA. Further, depletion of intracellular lipids reduced infection. Together, these data suggest that DENV reduces LRP-1 protein expression, possibly through regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), to increase intracellular cholesterol and facilitate replication in Ae. aegypti.

TI  - Dengue virus regulates type I interferon signalling in a strain-dependent manner in human cell lines.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 89 Pt 12
SP  - 3052
EP  - 62
AB  - Outbreaks of dengue disease are constant threats to tropical and subtropical populations but range widely in severity, from mild to haemorrhagic fevers, for reasons that are still elusive. We investigated the interferon (IFN) response in infected human cell lines A549 and HepG2, using two strains (NGC and TSV01) of dengue serotype 2 (DEN2) and found that the two viruses exhibited a marked difference in inducing type I IFN response. While TSV01 infection led to activation of type I antiviral genes such as EIF2AK2 (PKR), OAS, ADAR and MX, these responses were absent in NGC-infected cells. Biochemical analysis revealed that NGC but not TSV01 suppressed STAT-1 and STAT-2 activation in response to type I IFN (alpha and beta). However, these two strains did not differ in their response to type II IFN (gamma). Although unable to suppress IFN signalling, TSV01 infection caused a weaker IFN-beta induction compared with NGC, suggesting an alternative mechanism of innate immune escape. We extended our study to clinical isolates of various serotypes and found that while MY10245 (DEN2) and MY22713 (DEN4) could suppress the IFN response in a similar fashion to NGC, three other strains of dengue [EDEN167 (DEN1), MY02569 (DEN1) and MY10340 (DEN2)] were unable to suppress the IFN response, suggesting that this difference is strain-dependent but not serotype-specific. Our report indicates the existence of a strain-specific virulence factor that may impact on disease severity.

TI  - Dengue virus replication by platelets
JF  - ISBT Science Series
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes >100 million febrile infections annually. In ~2 million of these individuals, the disease may progress into life‐threatening haemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome. Approximately 200 million high‐titre infections remain asymptomatic and are a documented risk for transfusion transmission. Interestingly, both mild and severe DENV infections result in thrombocytopenia. Well‐established DENV receptors studies have suggested that similar receptors on platelets may facilitate comparable binding. To help explain DENV‐mediated platelet pathology, indirect evidence for a DENV‐platelet interaction with possible cell entry and direct binding has been reported. Increasing evidence has established that platelets contain the necessary translational machinery to generate protein from RNA. Since DENV has an RNA genome, we hypothesized that platelets are permissive to DENV replication. Using highly purified DENV and platelets, a specific dendritic cell‐specific intercellular adhesin molecule‐3‐grabbing non‐integrin/heparan proteoglycan coreceptor binding system was identified. Demonstrating de novo virus protein and genome generation and production of infectious progeny by viable platelets now adds to the understanding of DENV‐associated thrombocytopenia. Of importance to global blood systems, donor‐derived platelet concentrates (PCs) and red‐blood‐cells units (RBCs) also replicated viral RNA. In each case, DENV underwent spontaneous logarithmic decay which was offset by the production of new virus progeny. While DENV persisted through the duration of PC and RBC storage, these data suggest the possibility that older units may be less infectious. We speculate that platelets may be active contributors to virus infection, and in the case of viruses with an RNA genome, platelets may initially serve as replication centers.

TI  - Dengue virus replication enhances labile zinc pools by modulation of ZIP8
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 23
AB  - Zinc‐dependent viral proteins rely on intracellular zinc homeostasis for successful completion of infectious life‐cycle. Here, we report that the intracellular labile zinc levels were elevated at early stages of dengue virus (DENV) infection in hepatic cells and this increase in free zinc was abolished in cells infected with UV‐inactivated virus or with a DENV replication inhibitor implicating a role for zinc homeostasis in viral RNA replication. This change in free zinc was mediated by zinc transporter, ZIP8, as siRNA‐mediated knockdown of ZIP8 resulted in abrogation of increase in free zinc levels leading to significant reduction in DENV titers suggesting a crucial role for ZIP8 in early stages of DENV replication. Furthermore, elevated free zinc levels correlated with high copy numbers of dengue genome in peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from dengue patients compared to healthy controls suggesting a critical role for zinc homeostasis in dengue infection.

TI  - Dengue virus replication in human hepatoma cells activates NF-kappaB which in turn induces apoptotic cell death
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 71
SP  - 3244
EP  - 3249
AB  - The severe outcome of the dengue (DEN) virus infection known as DEN hemorrhagic fever-DEN shock syndrome (DHF-DSS) is, in some cases, accompanied by liver injury. Councilman bodies observed in liver biopsies of DHF-DSS cases may correspond to hepatocytes in apoptosis. We show here that infection of the hepatoma cell line HepG2 with DEN type 1 virus induced cell death typical of apoptosis late in the virus cycle. The transcription factor NF-kappaB was activated concomitantly with viral protein synthesis and thus before the appearance of apoptotic cells. Inhibition of apoptosis was observed when DEN virus-infected cells were treated with NF-kappaB decoys, indicating the involvement of this transcription factor in induction of cell death. Thus, infected hepatocytes appear to be subject to apoptosis in vitro, and this may be a key element in the pathophysiology of hepatic failure associated with DHF-DSS.

TI  - Dengue virus requires the CC‐chemokine receptor CCR5 for replication and infection development
JF  - Immunology
VL  - 145
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito‐borne disease that affects millions of people worldwide yearly. Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment available. Further investigation on dengue pathogenesis is required to better understand the disease and to identify potential therapeutic targets. The chemokine system has been implicated in dengue pathogenesis, although the specific role of chemokines and their receptors remains elusive. Here we describe the role of the CC‐chemokine receptor CCR5 in Dengue virus (DENV‐2) infection. In vitro experiments showed that CCR5 is a host factor required for DENV‐2 replication in human and mouse macrophages. DENV‐2 infection induces the expression of CCR5 ligands. Incubation with an antagonist prevents CCR5 activation and reduces DENV‐2 positive‐stranded (+) RNA inside macrophages. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of DENV‐2 infection we found that CCR5−/− mice were resistant to lethal infection, presenting at least 100‐fold reduction of viral load in target organs and significant reduction in disease severity. This phenotype was reproduced in wild‐type mice treated with CCR5‐blocking compounds. Therefore, CCR5 is a host factor required for DENV‐2 replication and disease development. Targeting CCR5 might represent a therapeutic strategy for dengue fever. These data bring new insights on the association between viral infections and the chemokine receptor CCR5.

TI  - Dengue virus strain 2 capsid protein switches the annealing pathway and reduces intrinsic dynamics of the conserved 5’ untranslated region
JF  - RNA Biology
VL  - 18
SP  - 718
EP  - 731
AB  - ABSTRACT The capsid protein of dengue virus strain 2 (DENV2C) promotes nucleic acid structural rearrangements using chaperone activity. However, the role of DENV2C during the interaction of RNA elements in the conserved 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) to the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) is still unclear. Thus, we investigated the effect of DENV2C on the annealing mechanism of two RNA hairpin elements from the 5’UTR to their complementary sequences during (+)/(-) ds-RNAformation and (+) RNA circularization. DENV2C was found to switch the annealing pathway for RNA elements involved in (+)/(-) ds-RNA formation, but not for RNA elements related to (+) RNA circularization. In addition, we also determined that DENV2C modulates intrinsic dynamics and reduces kinetically trapped unfavourable conformations of the 5’UTR sequence. Thus, our results provide mechanistic insights by which DENV2C chaperones the interactions between RNA elements at the 5’ and 3’ ends during genome recombination, a prerequisite for DENV replication.

TI  - Dengue virus strain DEN2 16681 utilizes a specific glycochain of syndecan-2 proteoglycan as a receptor.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 93 Pt 4
SP  - 761
EP  - 70
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes fever and severe haemorrhagic symptoms in humans. The DEN2 16681 strain, derived from a dengue haemorrhagic fever patient, has been widely used in studies related to DENV pathogenesis, such as mouse and non-human primate haemorrhagic models and human vascular endothelial-cell permeability. To clarify the entry mechanism of the 16681 strain, we characterized a novel cell receptor for this strain. Our two major findings were as follows: firstly, the SDC2 membrane protein was an effective DEN2 16681 receptor in a cloned K562 cell line. Secondly, a heparan sulfate (HS) glycochain (of four glycochains in SDC2) is the specific binding site of DENV and seems to be involved in tissue-culture adaptation. Our findings present an entry mechanism that could be implicated for DENV adaptation and HS-mediated DENV infection.

TI  - Dengue virus sustains viability of infected cells by counteracting apoptosis-mediated DNA breakage
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dengue is the most important arboviral disease inflicting mankind. This mosquito-borne Flavivirus causes mild to severe dengue fever which in some cases leads to life-threatening conditions namely, dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Annual infection is estimated at 390 million globally with 96 million manifesting clinically. So, ≥80% infections are asymptomatic and self-limiting. Dengue virus (DV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a proven virotoxin abundantly present in the victim’s blood. We found that DV-infected or only NS1-expressing cells both can induce Cleaved Caspase3, due to antiviral response of host cells. NS1-transfected cells also showed nuclear damage and significant levels of DNA breaks suggestive of ensuing apoptosis. So, it was established that NS1 alone is capable of causing apoptosis. Surprisingly, despite secreting similar amount of soluble NS1, the DV-infected cells showed intact nuclear morphology and background levels of DNA nicks. These observations suggested that DV downregulates apoptosis of infected cells, which is a viral strategy against host defence. Furthermore, DV-infected cells counteracted Camptothecin-induced apoptotic DNA break. DV-infection was also found to keep the infected cells metabolically more active than only NS1 expressing cells. So, DV bypasses cellular defence against virus i.e. apoptosis by counteracting cellular DNA break and keeps the infected cells metabolically active to support virus replication for longer period which eventually results in high virus titer in circulation. Our findings reveal another level of intricacy involving dengue virus-host interactions and perhaps explain why ≥80% DV infections are asymptomatic/self-limiting despite the presence of NS1 virotoxin in infected cells. Author Summary NS1, a virotoxin, abundantly present in Dengue patients blood, is a major player behind disease patho-biogenesis including plasma leakage. Despite the presence of NS1 in blood, Dengue is asymptomatic and self-limiting in more than 80% dengue virus (DV) infected people. We investigated this observation and found that plasmid-mediated NS1 expression and secretion in cells are sufficient to cause programmed cell death (apoptosis) and associated cellular DNA breakage. However, cells infected with dengue virus and secreting equivalent amounts of NS1 didn’t exhibit apoptotic DNA breakage. Consequently, DV-infected cells showed better survival than cells in which only NS1 was transiently expressed by transfection with expression plasmid. We also found that DV can even prevent chemical induced apoptotic DNA damage in infected host cells. So, DV bypasses host antiviral defence i.e. apoptosis by counteracting cellular DNA breakages and keeps the infected cells metabolically active to prolong virus replication.

TI  - Dengue virus targets RBM10 deregulating host cell splicing and innate immune response
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 48
SP  - 6824
EP  - 6838
AB  - Abstract RNA-seq experiments previously performed by our laboratories showed enrichment in intronic sequences and alterations in alternative splicing in dengue-infected human cells. The transcript of the SAT1 gene, of well-known antiviral action, displayed higher inclusion of exon 4 in infected cells, leading to an mRNA isoform that is degraded by non-sense mediated decay. SAT1 is a spermidine/spermine acetyl-transferase enzyme that decreases the reservoir of cellular polyamines, limiting viral replication. Delving into the molecular mechanism underlying SAT1 pre-mRNA splicing changes upon viral infection, we observed lower protein levels of RBM10, a splicing factor responsible for SAT1 exon 4 skipping. We found that the dengue polymerase NS5 interacts with RBM10 and its sole expression triggers RBM10 proteasome-mediated degradation. RBM10 over-expression in infected cells prevents SAT1 splicing changes and limits viral replication, while its knock-down enhances the splicing switch and also benefits viral replication, revealing an anti-viral role for RBM10. Consistently, RBM10 depletion attenuates expression of interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In particular, we found that RBM10 interacts with viral RNA and RIG-I, and even promotes the ubiquitination of the latter, a crucial step for its activation. We propose RBM10 fulfills diverse pro-inflammatory, anti-viral tasks, besides its well-documented role in splicing regulation of apoptotic genes.

EP  - 5
AB  - Apoptosis was detected in Vero cell cultures expressing transfected dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) genes. Approximately 17.5 and 51.5 % of cells expressing NS3 serine protease and NS2B-NS3(185) serine protease precursor protein [NS2B-NS3(185)(pro)] genes, respectively, were apoptotic. The percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in cell cultures expressing NS2B-NS3(185)(pro). NS2B-NS3(185)(pro) was detected as NS2B-NS3(185)(pro)-EGFP fusion protein in cytoplasmic vesicular structures in the apoptotic cells. Site-directed mutagenesis which replaced His(51) with Ala within the protease catalytic triad significantly reduced the ability of the expressed NS3 and NS2B-NS3(185)(pro) to induce apoptosis. Results from the present study showed that DENV-2-encoded NS3 serine protease induces apoptosis, which is enhanced in cells expressing its precursor, NS2B-NS3(185)(pro). These findings suggest the importance of NS2B as a cofactor to NS3 protease-induced apoptosis.

AB  - A method to map the specific site on dengue virus envelope protein (E) that interacts with cells and a neutralizing antibody is developed using serially truncated dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) E displayed on M13 phages as recombinant E-g3p fusion proteins. Recombinant phages displaying the truncated E consisting of amino acids 297-423 (EB2) and amino acids 379-423 (EB4) were neutralized by DENV-2 patient sera and the DENV-2 E-specific 3H5-1 monoclonal antibodies suggesting that the phages retained the DENV-2 E antigenic properties. The EB4 followed by EB2 recombinant phages bound the most to human monocytes (THP-1), African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, mosquito (C6/36) cells, ScFv specific against E and C6/36 cell proteins. Two potential cell attachment sites were mapped to loop I (amino acids 297 to 312) and loop II (amino acids 379-385) of the DENV-2 E using the phage-displayed truncated DENV-2 E fragments and by the analysis of the E structure. Loop II was present only in EB4 recombinant phages. There was no competition for binding to C6/36 cell proteins between EB2 and EB4 phages. Loop I and loop II are similar to the sub-complex specific and type-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody binding sites, respectively. Hence, it is proposed that binding and entry of DENV involves the interaction of loop I to cell surface glycosaminoglycan-motif and a subsequent highly specific interaction involving loop II with other cell proteins. The phage displayed truncated DENV-2 E is a powerful and useful method for the direct determination of DENV-2 E cell binding sites.

AB  - The endothelial cell line ECV304, derived from human umbilical cord and identified to be susceptible to dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2) infection, was used to study the molecular mechanism of DEN-2 binding to endothelial cells. DEN-2 was found by virus overlay protein-binding assays (VOPBAs) to bind to three ECV304 cell membrane proteins with molecular masses of 29, 34 and 43 kDa. Only a single protein of 29 kDa was observed when VOPBAs were carried out using preparations of trypsin-treated ECV304 cells. Pre-incubation of live ECV304 cells in culture or cell membrane proteins in modified VOPBAs with the recombinant DEN-2 envelope glycoprotein (rEgp) inhibited DEN-2 infection and blocked virus binding to the three proteins identified. These results indicate that DEN-2 rEgp could bind to three proteins on the surface of ECV304 cells. This virus-cell interaction may be associated with the receptor complex specific for DEN-2 infection of endothelial cells.

TI  - Dengue virus type 2 recognizes the carbohydrate moiety of neutral glycosphingolipids in mammalian and mosquito cells
JF  - Microbiology and Immunology
VL  - 55
AB  - Dengue viruses infect cells by attaching to a surface receptor which remains unknown. The putative receptor molecules of dengue virus type 2 on the surface of mosquito (AP‐61) and mammalian (LLC‐MK2) cell lines were investigated. The immunochemical detection and structural analysis of carbohydrates demonstrated that the neutral glycosphingolipids, L‐3 (GlcNAcβ1‐3Manβ1‐4Glcβ1‐1’Cer) in AP‐61 cells, and nLc4Cer (Galβ1‐4GlcNAcβ1‐3Galβ1‐4Glcβ1‐1’Cer) in LLC‐MK2 cells were recognized by the virus. These findings strongly suggest that neutral glycosphingolipids share the key determinant for virus binding and that the β‐GlcNAc residue may play an important role in dengue virus binding to the host cell surface.

TI  - Dengue virus type 2: replication and tropisms in orally infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
JF  - BMC Microbiology
VL  - 7
SP  - 9
EP  - 9
AB  - BackgroundTo be transmitted by its mosquito vector, dengue virus (DENV) must infect midgut epithelial cells, replicate and disseminate into the hemocoel, and finally infect the salivary glands, which is essential for transmission. The extrinsic incubation period (EIP) is very relevant epidemiologically and is the time required from the ingestion of virus until it can be transmitted to the next vertebrate host. The EIP is conditioned by the kinetics and tropisms of virus replication in its vector. Here we document the virogenesis of DENV-2 in newly-colonized Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from Chetumal, Mexico in order to understand better the effect of vector-virus interactions on dengue transmission.ResultsAfter ingestion of DENV-2, midgut infections in Chetumal mosquitoes were characterized by a peak in virus titers between 7 and 10 days post-infection (dpi). The amount of viral antigen and viral titers in the midgut then declined, but viral RNA levels remained stable. The presence of DENV-2 antigen in the trachea was positively correlated with virus dissemination from the midgut. DENV-2 antigen was found in salivary gland tissue in more than a third of mosquitoes at 4 dpi. Unlike in the midgut, the amount of viral antigen (as well as the percent of infected salivary glands) increased with time. DENV-2 antigen also accumulated and increased in neural tissue throughout the EIP. DENV-2 antigen was detected in multiple tissues of the vector, but unlike some other arboviruses, was not detected in muscle.ConclusionOur results suggest that the EIP of DENV-2 in its vector may be shorter that the previously reported and that the tracheal system may facilitate DENV-2 dissemination from the midgut. Mosquito organs (e.g. midgut, neural tissue, and salivary glands) differed in their response to DENV-2 infection.

TI  - Dengue virus up‐regulates expression of notch ligands Dll1 and Dll4 through interferon‐β signalling pathway
JF  - Immunology
VL  - 144
AB  - The Notch signalling pathway is involved in multiple cellular processes and has been recently indicated to modulate the host immune response. However, the role of the Notch pathway in dengue virus (DENV) infection remains unknown. Our study has screened the expression profile of Notch receptors, ligands and target genes in human monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells in response to DENV infection. The real‐time PCR data showed that Notch ligand Dll1 was significantly induced in DENV‐infected monocytes; and receptor Notch4, ligands Dll1 and Dll4, and target Hes1 were dramatically enhanced in DENV‐infected macrophages and dendritic cells. In macrophages, induction of Dll1 and Dll4 mediated by DENV2 was increased by treatment with interferon‐β (IFN‐β), and was impaired by neutralization of IFN‐β. The DENV‐induced Dll1 and Dll4 expression level was decreased by silencing key innate immune molecules, including Toll‐like receptor 3 (TLR3), MyD88, RIG‐I and IPS‐I. In IFN‐receptor‐depleted macrophages, the Dll1 and Dll4 induction was significantly alleviated. Functionally, activation of Notch signalling by Dll1 in CD4+ T cells enhanced the expression of a T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine IFN‐γ, while Notch activation in macrophages had no direct effect on replication of DENV. Our data revealed that the expressions of Notch ligands in antigen‐presenting cells were differentially induced by DENV via innate immune signalling, which is important for Th1/Th2 differentiation during adaptive immune response.

AB  - Dengue and other arbovirus diseases are frequently associated with bone marrow failure. We show that dengue type 4 (DEN4) propagates in colonies derived from immature human bone marrow progenitors. DEN4 was propagated in BFU-E-derived colonies and replication was dependent on erythropoietin. DEN4 was not cytotoxic. In inoculated cultures, diffuse bursts with many clusters contained large amounts of DEN4 RNA. In contrast to dengue infection of macrophages, virus propagation in semisolid culture was sustained and not enhanced by subneutralizing amounts of antibody. DEN4 also was efficiently propagated in human hematopoietic cell lines, especially those with erythroid properties. In K562 cells, DEN4 infection persisted for months; greatly slowed cell growth, again without cytotoxicity; and resulted in cytopathic changes in cell appearance. Flaviviruses can infect human hematopoietic cells and alter their proliferative capacity.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is currently considered as one of the most important mosquito-borne viral pathogens affecting humans. Genetic variations in viruses are likely to be a condition for more effective evasion of the immune system and resulting in severe clinical consequences. The DENV‑1 NS5 gene was sequenced to establish whether during an epidemic burst there were genetic variations of the virus and whether any variant was associated (through a case‑control design) with severe clinical behavior. A total of 31 patients positive for DENV‑1 were enrolled. Among the nucleotide differences between the sequences, only two generated amino acid changes. The variants 124Met/166Ser (amino acid positions according to the report GenBank AJL35015.1), were associated with a severe clinical course of the disease. Via in silico tests, it was identified that the variations generate changes in the protein probably affecting the function of type‑1 interferon, either at the level of its receptor or by interfering with the Janus kinase‑signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway.

TI  - Dengue virus-elicited tryptase induces endothelial permeability and shock.
JF  - The Journal of clinical investigation
VL  - 130
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes a characteristic pathology in humans involving dysregulation of the vascular system. In some patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), vascular pathology can become severe, resulting in extensive microvascular permeability and plasma leakage into tissues and organs. Mast cells (MCs), which line blood vessels and regulate vascular function, are able to detect DENV in vivo and promote vascular leakage. Here, we identified that a MC-derived protease, tryptase, is consequential for promoting vascular permeability during DENV infection, through inducing breakdown of endothelial cell tight junctions. Injected tryptase alone was sufficient to induce plasma loss from the circulation and hypovolemic shock in animals. A potent tryptase inhibitor, nafamostat mesylate, blocked DENV-induced vascular leakage in vivo. Importantly, in two independent human dengue cohorts, tryptase levels correlated with the grade of DHF severity. This study defines an immune mechanism by which DENV can induce vascular pathology and shock.

TI  - Dengue virus-induced apoptosis in hepatic cells is partly mediated by Apo2 ligand/tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 91 Pt 10
SP  - 2658
EP  - 
AB  - Received 17 August 2004 Accepted 7 January 2005 Although hepatic injury is reported in cases with dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, its mechanism remains poorly understood. Several findings suggest that dengue virus (DEN) induces apoptosis of hepatocytes in vivo. In this work, DEN type 2 (DEN-2) strain NGC was shown to induce apoptosis in the hepatic cell line HepG2, and infection of HepG2 cells was found to induce Apo2 ligand (Apo2L, also known as tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or TRAIL) expression. Furthermore, Apo2L/TRAIL induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells, which expressed the Apo2L/TRAIL receptor DR5/TRAIL-R2 on their surface. Analysis of the Apo2L/TRAIL promoter revealed that this gene was activated by DEN-2 infection, whose responsive element was overlapping NF-kBand Sp1-binding sites located at nt ”75 to ”65. The proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-norleucinal (LLnL) inhibited Apo2L/TRAIL mRNA expression, and LLnL and anti-Apo2L/TRAIL antibody inhibited DEN-2-induced apoptosis. It was proposed that DEN infection promotes apoptosis partly through the induction of Apo2L/TRAIL expression.

AB  - Abstract The biogenesis events and formation of dengue virus (DENV) in the infected host cells remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we examined the ultrastructural changes associated with DENV-2 replication in three susceptible host cells, C6/36, Vero and SK Hep1, a cell line of human endothelial origin, using transmission electron microscopy, whole-mount grid-cell culture techniques and electron tomography (ET). The prominent feature in C6/36 cells was the formation of large perinuclear vacuoles with mature DENV particles, and on-grid whole-mount examination of the infected Vero cells showed different forms of DENV core structures associated with cellular membranes within 48 h after infection. Distinct multivesicular structures and prominent autophagic vesicles were seen in the infected SK Hep1 cells when compared with the other two cell lines. ET showed the three-dimensional organization of these vesicles as a continuous system. This is the first report of ET-based analysis of DENV-2 replication in a human endothelial cell line. These results further emphasizes the strong role played by intracellular host membranes–virus interactions in the biogenesis of DENV and strongly argues for the possibility of targeting compounds to block such structure formation as key anti-dengue agents.

AB  - Enzymatic markers and electron microscopy were utilized to determine the cellular origin of the membrane types isolated from type 2 dengue virus-infected BHK cells by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. The results showed an apparent separation of plasma membrane, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum with increasing density. Virus-induced protein and RNA synthesis, as indicated by the incorporation of radiolabled precursors, was localized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Glycosylation, measured by the incorporation of radiolabeled glucosamine into membrane-associated proteins, was most active in the bands of intermediate and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of isolated membrane bands, radiolabeled in the presence of actinomycin D, after pulse inhibition by cycloheximide, revealed seven virus-specific proteins associated with all membrane fractions. Viral structural protein V-3, and nonstructural proteins NV-3 and NV-2, increased with decreasing density, whereas NV-5 and NV-4 remained constant. The viral capsid protein V-2 was depleted in the intermediate and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that these membranes may serve as the sites for viral maturation. NV-3 was the most prominent virus-specified protein found in the plasma membrane.

AB  - Dengue virus (DV)-induced changes in the host cell protein synthesis machinery are not well understood. We investigated the transcriptional changes related to initiation of protein synthesis. The human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, was infected with DV serotype 2 for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection of one. RNA was extracted after 6, 24 and 48 h. Microarray results showed that 36.5% of the translation factors related to initiation of protein synthesis had significant differential expression (Z-score >or= +/-2.0). Confirmation was obtained by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Of the genes involved in the activation of mRNA for cap-dependent translation (eIF4 factors), eIF4A, eIF4G1 and eIF4B were up-regulated while the negative regulator of translation eIF4E-BP3 was down-regulated. This activation was transient since at 24 h post-infection levels were not significantly different from control cells. However, at 48 h post-infection, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G1, eIF4G3, eIF4B, and eIF4E-BP3 were down-regulated, suggesting that cap-dependent translation could be inhibited during the progression of infection. To test this hypothesis, phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1, which induce cap-dependent protein synthesis, was assayed. Both proteins remained phosphorylated when assayed at 6 h after infection, while infection induced dephosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 at 24 and 48 h of infection, respectively. Taken together, these results provide biological evidence suggesting that in HepG2 cells DV sustains activation of the cap-dependent machinery at early stages of infection, but progression of infection switches protein synthesis to a cap-independent process.

TI  - Dengue virus-induced suppressor factor stimulates production of prostaglandin to mediate suppression.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 56 Pt 2
SP  - 241
EP  - 9
AB  - The immunosuppression in dengue type 2 virus (DV)-infected mice is mediated through secretion of a soluble suppressor factor (SF) produced by the T lymphocytes of the spleen. Activity of the suppressor cells was abrogated by pretreatment with indomethacin, indicating that suppression is mediated through prostaglandin (PG) or products of the PG synthetase pathway. The present study was undertaken to resolve the relationship between SF and PG. Treatment of mice with indomethacin did not affect production of SF. Therefore, PG is different from SF and the presence of PG is not essential for its production. Normal mouse spleen cells treated in vitro with SF produced PG which mediated suppression. Production of PG by these cells was abolished by pretreatment with anti-Thy 1.2 antibody and complement. It is concluded, therefore, that immunosuppression occurs in two phases: in the first step DV stimulates a subpopulation of T lymphocytes to produce SF, and in the second step SF induces a subpopulation of T lymphocytes to produce PG or products of the PG synthetase pathway which finally mediate suppression.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection affects millions of people annually and has the potential to cause fatal haemorrhagic fever and shock. Although the underlying pathogenesis of severe dengue illness is still unclear, current evidence suggests that severe disease progression has an immunological basis. In this study, we investigated the role of caspase-1 during host-pathogen interactions within DENV-infected human monocytes. Using DENV-infected primary monocytes, we examined caspase-1 at various levels of gene expression and probed for potential immune consequences mediated by caspase-1 such as secretion of pro-inflammatory IL-1β and pyroptotic cell death. We report that DENV-infected monocytes upregulated functional caspase-1 mRNA and pro-caspase-1 activation as a late response to infection. In addition, we found that caspase-1 is responsible for IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis of DENV-infected monocytes. Together, our results show that late caspase-1 activation within DENV-infected monocytes can contribute to pro-inflammatory outcomes that might play a role in dengue immunopathogenesis.

AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti is more widely dispersed now than at any time in the past, placing billions of humans at risk of infection with one or more of the four dengue viruses. This review presents and discusses information on mosquito-dengue infection dynamics and describes the prominent role that temperature and rainfall play in controlling dengue viral transmission including discussions of the effect of interannual climate variations and the predicted effect of global warming. Complementary human determinants of dengue epidemiology include viremia titer, variation in viremic period, enhanced viremias, and threshold viremia. Topics covered include epidemiological phenomena such as traveling waves, the generation of genetic diversity of dengue viruses following virgin soil introductions and in hyperendemic settings, and evidence for and against viral virulence as a determinant of the severity of dengue infections. Also described is the crucial role of monotypic and heterotypic herd immunity in shaping dengue epidemic behavior.

JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 6
SP  - 35
EP  - 35
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), the etiological agent of dengue fever, is transmitted to the human host during blood uptake by an infective mosquito. Infection of vector salivary glands and further injection of infectious saliva into the human host are key events of the DENV transmission cycle. However, the molecular mechanisms of DENV entry into the mosquito salivary glands have not been clearly identified. Otherwise, although it was demonstrated for other vector-transmitted pathogens that insect salivary components may interact with host immune agents and impact the establishment of infection, the role of mosquito saliva on DENV infection in human has been only poorly documented. To identify salivary gland molecules which might interact with DENV at these key steps of transmission cycle, we investigated the presence of proteins able to bind DENV in salivary gland extracts (SGE) from two mosquito species. Using virus overlay protein binding assay, we detected several proteins able to bind DENV in SGE from Aedes aegypti (L.) and Aedes polynesiensis (Marks). The present findings pave the way for the identification of proteins mediating DENV attachment or entry into mosquito salivary glands, and of saliva-secreted proteins those might be bound to the virus at the earliest step of human infection. The present findings might contribute to the identification of new targets for anti-dengue strategies.

TI  - Dengue viruses cleave STING in humans but not in nonhuman primates, their presumed natural reservoir
JF  - eLife
VL  - 7
AB  - Human dengue viruses emerged from primate reservoirs, yet paradoxically dengue does not reach high titers in primate models. This presents a unique opportunity to examine the genetics of spillover versus reservoir hosts. The dengue virus 2 (DENV2) - encoded protease cleaves human STING, reducing type I interferon production and boosting viral titers in humans. We find that both human and sylvatic (reservoir) dengue viruses universally cleave human STING, but not the STING of primates implicated as reservoir species. The special ability of dengue to cleave STING is thus specific to humans and a few closely related ape species. Conversion of residues 78/79 to the human-encoded ‘RG’ renders all primate (and mouse) STINGs sensitive to viral cleavage. Dengue viruses may have evolved to increase viral titers in the dense and vast human population, while maintaining decreased titers and pathogenicity in the more rare animals that serve as their sustaining reservoir in nature.

Recent work has indicated that DENV affinity for cell lines is serotype-specific, which raises challenging questions regarding DENV-host interactions as well as the development of therapeutics and control programs. Methods: We evaluated the infectious capacity of 11 strains of DENV for serotypes 1–4 in 17 distinct cell lines. The cell lines were evaluated for virus susceptibility via immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: Both methods demonstrated the ability of DENV to replicate in all cell lines, with viral titers ranging from 1 × 10 to 1 × 10 infectious units per mL. Cell line susceptibility to DENV infection was strain-specific, with DENV-4 strains infecting more cell lines than the other serotypes. DENV-2 New Guinea C and DENV-4 H241 were detected in more cell lines than any other strains. Viral fusion assays indicated that DENV requirements for fusion are strain-specific. Conclusion: These data indicate that several cell lines can be used to culture and study DENV. The strain-specific susceptibility for certain cell lines may provide a tool for characterizing specific DENV strains and an in vitro platform for the development and optimization of therapeutics, the study of host-pathogen interactions, and ecological studies on the cocirculation of DENV strains in a specific region or individual.

TI  - Dengue viruses infect human megakaryocytes, with probable clinical consequences
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 13
AB  - One of the most important clinical signs of dengue virus infection is the reduction of white blood cells and platelets in human peripheral blood (leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively), which may significantly impair the clearance of dengue virus by the immune system. The cause of thrombocytopenia and leukopenia during dengue infection is still unknown, but may be related to severe suppression of bone marrow populations including hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocytes, the progenitors of white blood cells and platelets respectively. Here, we explored the possibility that bone marrow suppression, including ablation of megakaryocyte populations, is caused by dengue virus infection of megakaryocytes. We used three different models to measure dengue virus infection and replication: in vitro, in a human megakaryocyte cell line with viral receptors, ex vivo, in primary human megakaryocytes, and in vivo, in humanized mice. All three systems support dengue virus infection and replication, including virus strains from serotypes 1, 2, and 3, and clinical signs, in vivo; all assays showed viral RNA and/or infectious viruses 7–14 days post-infection. Although we saw no significant decrease in cell viability in vitro, there was significant depletion of mature megakaryocytes in vivo. We conclude that megakaryocytes can produce dengue viruses in the bone marrow niche, and a reduction of cell numbers may affect bone marrow homeostasis.

TI  - Dengue virus‐activated platelets modulate monocyte immunometabolic response through lipid droplet biogenesis and cytokine signaling
JF  - Journal of Leukocyte Biology
VL  - 108
SP  - 1293
EP  - 1306
AB  - Dengue is characterized as one of the most important arthropod‐borne human viral diseases, representing a public health problem. Increased activation of immune cells is involved in the progression of infection to severe forms. Recently, our group demonstrated the contribution of platelet–monocyte interaction to inflammatory responses in dengue, adding to evolving evidence that platelets have inflammatory functions and can regulate different aspects of innate immune responses. Furthermore, stimuli‐specific‐activated platelets can promote phenotypic changes and metabolic reprogramming in monocytes. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the roles of dengue virus (DENV)‐activated platelets on immunometabolic reprogramming of monocytes in vitro, focusing on lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis. We demonstrated that platelets exposed to DENV in vitro form aggregates with monocytes and signal to LD formation and CXCL8/IL‐8, IL‐10, CCL2, and PGE2 secretion. Pharmacologic inhibition of LD biogenesis prevents PGE2 secretion, but not CXCL8/IL‐8 release, by platelet–monocyte complexes. In exploring the mechanisms involved, we demonstrated that LD formation in monocytes exposed to DENV‐activated platelets is partially dependent on platelet‐produced MIF. Additionally, LD formation is higher in monocytes, which have platelets adhered on their surface, suggesting that beyond paracrine signaling, platelet adhesion is an important event in platelet‐mediated modulation of lipid metabolism in monocytes. Together, our results demonstrate that activated platelets aggregate with monocytes during DENV infection and signal to LD biogenesis and the secretion of inflammatory mediators, which may contribute to dengue immunopathogenesis.

TI  - Dengue virus‐induced cytotoxin releases nitrite by spleen cells
JF  - International Journal of Experimental Pathology
VL  - 77
AB  - Dengue type‐2 virus (DV) infection in mice induces T cells to produce a cytokine, the cytotoxic factor (CF), which induces H2‐A positive macrophages to produce another cytokine, cyotoxin (CF2), which amplifies its cytotoxic effects on target cells. The present study was undertaken to investigate the production of nitrite (NO−2) by the spleen cells of mice in vitro and in vivo following inoculation of CF2. Maximum NO−2 production occurred at 1 hour after inoculation of 100 μg CF2. Pretreatment of CF2 with anti‐CF2‐antisera (CF2‐As) inhibited the production of NO−2. Pretreatment of the spleen cells with NG‐monomethyl‐l‐arginine (NMA) or with arginase inhibited NO−2 production. The NO−2 production was diminished in a dose dependent manner by treatment of spleen cells with the Ca2+ channel blocking drug, nifedipine and Zn2+ as ZnSO4. The findings of the present study thus demonstrate that CF2 induces production of NO−2 in the spleen cells in a CA2+‐dependent manner which may be a mechanism of target cell killing.

TI  - Dengue virus‐induced human cytotoxic factor: production by peripheral blood leucocytes in vitro
JF  - Clinical & Experimental Immunology
VL  - 102
AB  - During dengue type 2 virus (DV) infection of mice a unique cytokine, the cytotoxic factor (CF), is produced which reproduces the pathological lesions seen in patients of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Recently we have observed a CF‐like protein in the sera of DHF cases. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether DV can stimulate human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro to produce human CF (hCF). Cultures prepared from PBMC or its enriched subpopulations were inoculated with 1000 LD50 of DV and controls with normal mouse brain suspension (NMB). Aliquots of cultures were harvested daily from 24 h to 96 h and their supernatant (CS) and cells were separated. CS were screened for viral titres and for the presence of hCF by cytotoxicity assay, inhibition ELISA, dot blot and Western blot tests using anti‐mouse‐CF antibodies. The RNA from the cells was screened in Northern blot and dot blot tests for the presence of mRNA for CF. It was observed that hCF appeared in the CS of DV‐infected culture of PBMC and T‐enriched cells at 48 h and was present until 96 h; no CF was detected in CS of B cells or monocyte cultures. The production of hCF was abrogated by pretreatment of the T cells with anti‐CD4 antibodies but not with anti‐CDS antibodies, indicating that hCF was produced by CD4 T cells. The Northern blot analysis using oligonucleotide probes prepared on the basis of amino‐terminal sequence of mouse CF, showed presence of mRNA for hCF in PBMC and T cell cultures. DV replicated in PBMC cultures with peak titres at 48 h. The findings of the present study demonstrate that DV‐induced hCF is produced by human T cells.

AB  - Flaviviruses cause severe acute febrile and haemorrhagic infections, including dengue and yellow fever and the pathogenesis of these infections is caused by an exacerbated immune response. Dendritic cells (DCs) are targets for dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YF) replication and are the first cell population to interact with these viruses during a natural infection, which leads to an induction of protective immunity in humans. We studied the infectivity of DENV2 (strain 16681), a YF vaccine (YF17DD) and a chimeric YF17D/DENV2 vaccine in monocyte-derived DCs in vitro with regard to cell maturation, activation and cytokine production. Higher viral antigen positive cell frequencies were observed for DENV2 when compared with both vaccine viruses. Flavivirus-infected cultures exhibited dendritic cell activation and maturation molecules. CD38 expression on DCs was enhanced for both DENV2 and YF17DD, whereas OX40L expression was decreased as compared to mock-stimulated cells, suggesting that a T helper 1 profile is favoured. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production in cell cultures was significantly higher in DENV2-infected cultures than in cultures infected with YF17DD or YF17D/DENV. In contrast, the vaccines induced higher IFN-α levels than DENV2. The differential cytokine production indicates that DENV2 results in TNF induction, which discriminates it from vaccine viruses that preferentially stimulate interferon expression. These differential response profiles may influence the pathogenic infection outcome.

EP  - 9
AB  - Monocytes/macrophages are important targets for dengue virus (DENV) replication; they induce inflammatory mediators and are sources of viral dissemination in the initial phase of the disease. Apoptosis is an active process of cellular destruction genetically regulated, in which a complex enzymatic pathway is activated and may be trigged by many viral infections. Since the mechanisms of apoptotic induction in DENV-infected target cells are not yet defined, we investigated the virus-cell interaction using a model of primary human monocyte infection with DENV-2 with the aim of identifying apoptotic markers. Cultures analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy yielded DENV antigen positive cells with rates that peaked at the second day post infection (p.i.), decayed afterwards and produced the apoptosis-related cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-10. Phosphatidylserine, an early marker for apoptosis, was increased at the cell surface and the Fas death receptor was upregulated at the second day p.i. at significantly higher rates in DENV infected cell cultures than controls. However, no detectable changes were observed in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in infected cultures. Our data support virus modulation of extrinsic apoptotic factors in the in vitro model of human monocyte DENV-2 infection. DENV may be interfering in activation and death mechanisms by inducing apoptosis in target cells.

VL  - 54 5

EP  - 10
AB  - Dengue is often associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, suggesting that cells of the bone marrow may be targets of dengue viral infections. In this study we infected long-term marrow cultures with dengue type-2 (DEN-2) virus and characterized the viral antigen-positive cells. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemical staining, we demonstrated two types of stromal cells that were positive for DEN-2 virus antigens. The first was a population of relatively small (approximately 25 microns) CD11b/CD18 (MAC-1)-positive cells. When stained with anti-DEN-2 polyclonal antibody, these cells showed viral antigen-positive inclusions and, when stained with anti-tubulin or anti-vimentin antibodies, they showed a diffuse pattern of fluorescence, consistent with mobile dendritic cells with phagocytic functions. The second population of DEN-2 antigen-positive cells comprised a smaller proportion of the total cells. It was made up of larger cells (> 100 microns) that had a well-formed cytoskeletal system as demonstrated by intense staining with anti-actin, anti-tubulin, and anti-vimentin antibodies. When stained with anti-DEN-2 antibody, these cells showed a more diffuse pattern of fluorescence in the perinuclear and Golgi regions, consistent with ongoing virus replication. These large, strongly adherent cells were positive for nerve growth factor receptor, consistent with their identification as adventitial reticular cells. The molecule that mediates the virus interaction with susceptible cells has not previously been identified. Using plasma membrane proteins isolated from K562 cells, virus-binding studies suggest that an approximately 100-kD membrane protein may be involved in the initial virus-cell interaction.

TI  - Dengue-3 Virus Entry into Vero Cells: Role of Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis in the Outcome of Infection
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 10
AB  - The endocytic uptake and intracellular trafficking for penetration of DENV-3 strain H-87 into Vero cells was analyzed by using several biochemical inhibitors and dominant negative mutants of cellular proteins. The results presented show that the infective entry of DENV-3 into Vero cells occurs through a non-classical endocytosis pathway dependent on low pH and dynamin, but non-mediated by clathrin. After uptake, DENV-3 transits through early endosomes to reach Rab 7-regulated late endosomes, and according with the half-time for ammonium chloride resistance viral nucleocapsid is released into the cytosol approximately at 12 min post-infection. Furthermore, the influence of the clathrin pathway in DENV-3 infective entry in other mammalian cell lines of human origin, such as A549, HepG2 and U937 cells, was evaluated demonstrating that variable entry pathways are employed depending on the host cell. Results show for the first time the simultaneous coexistence of infective and non -infective routes for DENV entry into the host cell, depending on the usage of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

TI  - Dengue-induced autophagy, virus replication and protection from cell death require ER stress (PERK) pathway activation
JF  - Cell Death & Disease
VL  - 7
AB  - A virus that reproduces in a host without killing cells can easily establish a successful infection. Previously, we showed that dengue-2, a virus that threatens 40% of the world, induces autophagy, enabling dengue to reproduce in cells without triggering cell death. Autophagy further protects the virus-laden cells from further insults. In this study, we evaluate how it does so; we show that dengue upregulates host pathways that increase autophagy, namely endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) signaling followed by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inhibition of ER stress or ATM signaling abrogates the dengue-conferred protection against other cell stressors. Direct inhibition of ER stress response in infected cells decreases autophagosome turnover, reduces ROS production and limits reproduction of dengue virus. Blocking ATM activation, which is an early response to infection, decreases transcription of ER stress response proteins, but ATM has limited impact on production of ROS and virus titers. Production of ROS determines only late-onset autophagy in infected cells and is not necessary for dengue-induced protection from stressors. Collectively, these results demonstrate that among the multiple autophagy-inducing pathways during infection, ER stress signaling is more important to viral replication and protection of cells than either ATM or ROS-mediated signaling. To limit virus production and survival of dengue-infected cells, one must address the earliest phase of autophagy, induced by ER stress.

TI  - Dengue-mediated changes in the vectorial capacity of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae): manipulation of transmission or infection by-product?
JF  - Journal of Medical Entomology
VL  - 62
SP  - 19
EP  - 28
AB  - Abstract An arthropod’s vectorial capacity summarizes its disease transmission potential. Life-history traits, such as fecundity or survival, and behavioral traits, such as locomotor activity, host-seeking and feeding behavior, are important components of vectorial capacity. Studies have shown that mosquito-borne pathogens may alter important vectorial capacity traits of their mosquito vectors, thus directly impacting their transmission and epidemic potential. Here, we compile and discuss the evidence supporting dengue-mediated changes in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.), its primary vector, and evaluate whether the observed effects represent an evolved trait manipulation with epidemiological implications. Dengue infection appears to manipulate essential traits that facilitate vector–host contact, such as locomotor activity, host-seeking, and feeding behavior, but the underlying mechanisms are still not understood. Conversely, life-history traits relevant to vector population dynamics, such as survival, oviposition, and fecundity, appear to be negatively impacted by dengue virus. Overall, any detrimental effects on life-history traits may be a negligible cost derived from the virulence that dengue has evolved to facilitate its transmission by manipulating Ae. aegypti behavior and feeding performance. However, methodological disparities among studies render comparisons difficult and limit the ability to reach well-supported conclusions. This highlights the need for more standardized methods for the research into changes in virus-mediated traits. Eventually, we argue that the effects on life-history traits and behavior outlined here must be considered when assessing the epidemiological impact of dengue or other arbovirus–vector–host interactions.

VL  - 129

EP  - 
AB  - Accumulating evidence demonstrates that CD8+ T cells contribute to protection from severe dengue virus (DENV) disease and vaccine efficacy. Nevertheless, molecular programs associated with DENV-specific CD8+ T cell subsets have not been defined. Here, we studied the transcriptomic profiles of human DENV-specific CD8+ T cells isolated after stimulation with DENV epitopes from donors who had been infected with DENV multiple times and would therefore be expected to have significant levels of adaptive immunity. We found that DENV-specific CD8+ T cells mainly consisted of effector memory subsets, namely CD45RA−CCR7− effector memory (Tem) and CD45RA+CCR7− effector memory re-expressing CD45RA (Temra) cells, which enacted specific gene expression profiles upon stimulation with cognate antigens. DENV-specific CD8+ T cell subsets in general, and Temra cells in particular, were fully activated and polyfunctional, yet associated with relatively narrow transcriptional responses. Furthermore, we found that DENV-specific CD8+ Tem and Temra cells showed some unique T cell receptor features in terms of overlap and variable (V) gene usage. This study provides a transcriptomic definition of DENV-specific activated human CD8+ T cell subsets and defines a benchmark profile that vaccine-specific responses could aim to reproduce.

TI  - DenvInt: A database of protein–protein interactions between dengue virus and its hosts
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue fever and associated dengue hemorrhagic fever are emerging globally as the most important arboviral disease for human population [1]. The dengue viruses (DENV) are members of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses, or arboviruses, which means they need an insect as a host to complete their life cycle. The full life cycle of dengue fever virus evolves the role of mosquito as a transmitter and human as the main victim and source of infection [2]. When a mosquito bites a person who has DENV in his or her blood, the mosquito becomes infected with the DENV. An infected mosquito can later transmit that virus to healthy people by biting them. This dengue disease is rapidly spreading in all regions of WHO in recent years. Recently, one dengue vaccine was licensed, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV), developed by Sanofi Pasteur (http://www.who.int/immunization/research/development/dengue_q_and_a/en/). But it is only applicable for use in individuals 9–45 years of age, and the vaccine is currently not prequalified. Therefore, intensive efforts to develop a vaccine to protect against dengue are still ongoing. It is primarily transmitted by 1 mosquito species, Aedes aegypti. The virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes. After virus incubation for 4–10 days, an infected mosquito is able to transmit the virus for the rest of its life. In 1943, Ren Kimura and Susumu Hotta first quarantined the DENV [3]. These 2 scientists were studying blood samples of patients taken during the 1943 dengue epidemic in Nagasaki, Japan. One year later, Albert B. Sabin and Walter Schlesinger independently isolated the DENV [4]. The DENV genome is a single strand of RNA. It is referred to as positive-sense RNA because it can be directly translated into proteins. The viral genome encodes 10 proteins, as shown in Fig 1. Three are structural proteins, which are the capsid (C), the precursor of membrane protein (PrM/M), and the envelope protein (E), while the rest are nonstructural (NS) proteins:NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5. These NS proteins play roles in viral replication and assembly. Because the dengue genome encodes only 10 viral proteins, the virus needs to hijack host proteins to help its replication. An understanding of how viruses interact with host cellular machineries to survive and replicate is important for the development of drugs. One way that viruses interact with their hosts is by protein–protein interactions (PPI). Therefore, indentifying PPI between DENV and host proteins will increase understanding of the function of virus proteins and how they reproduce and cause disease.

AB  - ABSTRACT Mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue, malaria, and lymphatic filariasis, exact a devastating toll on global health and economics, killing or debilitating millions every year (54). Mosquito innate immune responses are at the forefront of concerted research efforts aimed at defining potential target genes that could be manipulated to engineer pathogen resistance in vector populations. We aimed to describe the pivotal role that circulating blood cells (called hemocytes) play in immunity by generating a total of 11,952 Aedes aegypti and 12,790 Armigeres subalbatus expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences from immune response-activated hemocyte libraries. These ESTs collapsed into 2,686 and 2,107 EST clusters, respectively. The clusters were used to adapt the web-based interface for annotating bacterial genomes called A Systematic Annotation Package for Community Analysis of Genomes (ASAP) for analysis of ESTs. Each cluster was categorically characterized and annotated in ASAP based on sequence similarity to five sequence databases. The sequence data and annotations can be viewed in ASAP at https://asap.ahabs.wisc.edu/annotation/php/ASAP1.htm . The data presented here represent the results of the first high-throughput in vivo analysis of the transcriptome of immunocytes from an invertebrate. Among the sequences are those for numerous immunity-related genes, many of which parallel those employed in vertebrate innate immunity, that have never been described for these mosquitoes.

TI  - Desialylation of plasma proteins in severe dengue infection: possible role of oxidative stress.
JF  - The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene
VL  - 79 3
SP  - 372
EP  - 7
AB  - Oxidative stress in dengue infection has been suggested. This study was carried out to explore the plasma protein oxidation and its sialic acid content in dengue infection. Thirty-two dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), 25 dengue shock syndrome (DSS), 29 dengue fever (DF), and 63 healthy controls were included in this study. The extent of carbonylation, sulphydryl content, and desialylation of plasma protein was estimated in acute phase sample. Significantly higher levels of protein carbonyls and lower levels of sialic acid and sulphydryl groups were found in DHF and DSS compared with DF using one-way analysis of variance. Regression analysis showed that desialylation is dependent on protein carbonyls in DHF/DSS. This study indicates that, in dengue infection, plasma proteins undergo increased levels of desialylation, which can be attributed to the oxidative stress. Future studies on sialylation status of endothelium and platelets can show light into the pathogenesis of the dengue infection.

TI  - Desialylation of platelets induced by Von Willebrand Factor is a novel mechanism of platelet clearance in dengue
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 15
AB  - Thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction are commonly observed in patients with dengue virus (DENV) infection and may contribute to complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage. The etiology of dengue-associated thrombocytopenia is multifactorial and includes increased platelet clearance. The binding of the coagulation protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) to the platelet membrane and removal of sialic acid (desialylation) are two well-known mechanisms of platelet clearance, but whether these conditions also contribute to thrombocytopenia in dengue infection is unknown. In two observational cohort studies in Bandung and Jepara, Indonesia, we show that adult patients with dengue not only had higher plasma concentrations of plasma VWF antigen and active VWF, but that circulating platelets had also bound more VWF to their membrane. The amount of platelet-VWF binding correlated well with platelet count. Furthermore, sialic acid levels in dengue patients were significantly reduced as assessed by the binding of Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) and Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL-II) to platelets. Sialic acid on the platelet membrane is neuraminidase-labile, but dengue virus has no known neuraminidase activity. Indeed, no detectable activity of neuraminidase was present in plasma of dengue patients and no desialylation was found of plasma transferrin. Platelet sialylation was also not altered by in vitro exposure of platelets to DENV nonstructural protein 1 or cultured DENV. In contrast, induction of binding of VWF to glycoprotein 1b on platelets using the VWF-activating protein ristocetin resulted in the removal of platelet sialic acid by translocation of platelet neuraminidase to the platelet surface. The neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir reduced VWF-induced platelet desialylation. Our data demonstrate that excessive binding of VWF to platelets in dengue results in neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation and platelet clearance. Oseltamivir might be a novel treatment option for severe thrombocytopenia in dengue infection.

AB  - A mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) to dengue 4 (DEN-4) virus reacted with the antigen in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm of DEN-4-infected mammalian and mosquito cells, as demonstrated by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining method. The intranuclear antigen appeared to accumulate at the nucleoli, forming spots, whereas the cytoplasmic antigen appeared to be localized mainly in large perinuclear foci in the infected cells. The MAb-reactive antigen was produced in the presence of actinomycin D, which caused the accumulation in the nucleus to be altered to a dispersed pattern. Radioimmunoprecipitation analysis of [35S]methionine-labelled purified virions and Western blot analysis of the antigens prepared from the infected mammalian and mosquito cells showed that the MAb was directed against the DEN-4 virus core protein (Mr 15.5K). These results indicated that the DEN-4 virus core protein was partially transported, soon after its synthesis in the cytoplasm, into the nucleus and accumulated at the nucleoli.

TI  - Detection of micro RNA hsa-let-7e in peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with dengue virus serotype-2: preliminary study
JF  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
VL  - 125
AB  - Pathogenesis of dengue infection is still obscure. Recently, the role of microRNA has been associated with the cytokine storm which leads to plasma leakage in endothelial cells. The objective of our study was to determine whether particular microRNA is overexpressed in PBMCs infected with DENV and to assess its correlation to the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) proteins to increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We report the result of a preliminary study on the expression of microRNA hsa-let-7e. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the healthy volunteer were infected with the clinical isolate of DENV-2. RNA was extracted with miRCURYLNATMExiqon. Quantitative Real-Time PCR was used to measure the relative expression of hsa-let-7e micro RNA and the mRNA of SOCS3 proteins. MicroRNA hsa-let-7e expression was increased in PBMCs upon DENV-2 infection. The relative expression of hsa-let-7e is detected at 1.46 folds relative to uninfected PBMCs in 4 hours post-infection and decreased in 19 hours post infection. In contrast, the expression of mRNA of SOCS3 was inversely expressed with hsa-let-7 expression. MicroRNA was overexpressed in PBMCs upon infection with DENV-2. This microRNA may bind the SOCS3 and contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue infection.

TI  - Determinants in Nonstructural Protein 4A of Dengue Virus Required for RNA Replication and Replication Organelle Biogenesis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - DENV is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus, causing around 390 million infections each year. There are no approved therapies to treat DENV infection, and the only available vaccine shows limited efficacy. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) constitutes one of the most important arboviral pathogens affecting humans. The high prevalence of DENV infections, which cause more than 20,000 deaths annually, and the lack of effective vaccines or direct-acting antiviral drugs make it a global health concern. DENV genome replication occurs in close association with the host endomembrane system, which is remodeled to form the viral replication organelle that originates from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. To date, the viral and cellular determinants responsible for the biogenesis of DENV replication organelles are still poorly defined. The viral nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) can remodel membranes and has been shown to associate with numerous host factors in DENV-replicating cells. In the present study, we used reverse and forward genetic screens and identified sites within NS4A required for DENV replication. We also mapped the determinants in NS4A required for interactions with other viral proteins. Moreover, taking advantage of our recently developed polyprotein expression system, we evaluated the role of NS4A in the formation of DENV replication organelles. Together, we report a detailed map of determinants within NS4A required for RNA replication, interaction with other viral proteins, and replication organelle formation. Our results suggest that NS4A might be an attractive target for antiviral therapy. IMPORTANCE DENV is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus, causing around 390 million infections each year. There are no approved therapies to treat DENV infection, and the only available vaccine shows limited efficacy. The viral nonstructural proteins have emerged as attractive drug targets due to their pivotal role in RNA replication and establishment of virus-induced membranous compartments, designated replication organelles (ROs). The transmembrane protein NS4A, generated by cleavage of the NS4A-2K-4B precursor, contributes to DENV replication by unknown mechanisms. Here, we report a detailed genetic interaction map of NS4A and identify residues required for RNA replication and interaction between NS4A-2K-4B and NS2B-3 as well as NS1. Importantly, by means of an expression-based system, we demonstrate the essential role of NS4A in RO biogenesis and identify determinants in NS4A required for this process. Our data suggest that NS4A is an attractive target for antiviral therapy.

EP  - 308
AB  - One mechanism by which dengue (DEN) virus may cause cell death is apoptosis. In this study, we investigated whether the genetic determinants responsible for acquisition by DEN type 1 (DEN-1) virus of mouse neurovirulence interfere with the induction of apoptosis. Neurovirulent variant FGA/NA d1d was generated during the adaptation of the human isolate of DEN-1 virus strain FGA/89 to grow in newborn mouse brains and mosquito cells in vitro [Desprès, P. Frenkiel, M. -P. Ceccaldi, P.-E. Duarte Dos Santos, C. and Deubel, V. (1998) J. Virol., 72: 823-829]. Genetic determinants possibly responsible for mouse neurovirulence were studied by sequencing the entire genomes of both DEN-1 viruses. Three amino acid differences in the envelope E protein and one in the nonstructural NS3 protein were found. The cytotoxicity of the mouse-neurovirulent DEN-1 variant was studied in different target cells in vitro and compared with the parental strain. FGA/NA d1d was more pathogenic for mouse neuroblastoma cells and attenuated for human hepatoma cells. Changes in virus replicative functions and virus assembly may account, in a large part, for the differences in the induction of apoptosis. Our data suggest that identified amino acid substitutions in the envelope E protein and viral RNA helicase NS3 may influence DEN-1 virus pathogenicity by altering viral growth.

TI  - Determinants of Dengue Virus NS4A Protein Oligomerization
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 6171
EP  - 6183
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus NS4A protein induces host membrane rearrangement and functions as a replication complex component. The molecular details of how flavivirus NS4A exerts these functions remain elusive. Here, we used dengue virus (DENV) as a model to characterize and demonstrate the biological relevance of flavivirus NS4A oligomerization. DENV type 2 (DENV-2) NS4A protein forms oligomers in infected cells or when expressed alone. Deletion mutagenesis mapped amino acids 50 to 76 (spanning the first transmembrane domain [TMD1]) of NS4A as the major determinant for oligomerization, while the N-terminal 50 residues contribute only slightly to the oligomerization. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of NS4A amino acids 17 to 80 suggests that residues L31, L52, E53, G66, and G67 could participate in oligomerization. Ala substitution for 15 flavivirus conserved NS4A residues revealed that these amino acids are important for viral replication. Among the 15 mutated NS4A residues, 2 amino acids (E50A and G67A) are located within TMD1. Both E50A and G67A attenuated viral replication, decreased NS4A oligomerization, and reduced NS4A protein stability. In contrast, NS4A oligomerization was not affected by the replication-defective mutations (R12A, P49A, and K80A) located outside TMD1. trans complementation experiments showed that expression of wild-type NS4A alone was not sufficient to rescue the replication-lethal NS4A mutants. However, the presence of DENV-2 replicons could partially restore the replication defect of some lethal NS4A mutants (L26A and K80A), but not others (L60A and E122A), suggesting an unidentified mechanism governing the outcome of complementation in a mutant-dependent manner. Collectively, the results have demonstrated the importance of TMD1-mediated NS4A oligomerization in flavivirus replication. IMPORTANCE We report that DENV NS4A forms oligomers. Such NS4A oligomerization is mediated mainly through amino acids 50 to 76 (spanning the first transmembrane domain [TMD1]). The biological importance of NS4A oligomerization is demonstrated by results showing that mutations of flavivirus conserved residues (E50A and G67A located within TMD1) reduced the oligomerization and stability of the NS4A protein, leading to attenuated viral replication. A systematic mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that flavivirus conserved NS4A residues are important for DENV replication. A successful trans complementation of replication-lethal NS4A mutant virus requires wild-type NS4A in the context of the viral replication complex. The wild-type NS4A protein alone is not sufficient to rescue the replication defect of NS4A mutants. Intriguingly, distinct NS4A mutants yielded different complementation outcomes in the replicon-containing cells. Overall, the study has enhanced our understanding of flavivirus NS4A at the molecular level. The results also suggest that inhibitor blocking of NS4A oligomerization could be explored for antiviral drug discovery.

TI  - Determination of the Disulfide Bond Arrangement of Dengue Virus NS1 Protein*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 279
SP  - 20729
EP  - 20741
AB  - The 12 half-cystines of NS1 proteins are absolutely conserved among flaviviruses, suggesting their importance to the structure and function of these proteins. In the present study, peptides from recombinant Dengue-2 virus NS1 were produced by tryptic digestion in 100% H216O, peptic digestion in 50% H218O, thermolytic digestion in 50% H218O, or combinations of these digestion conditions. Peptides were separated by size exclusion and/or reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and examined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization post-source decay, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Where digests were performed in 50% H218O, isotope profiles of peptide ions aided in the identification and characterization of disulfide-linked peptides. It was possible to produce two-chain peptides containing C1/C2, C3/C4, C5/C6, and C7/C12 linkages as revealed by comparison of the peptide masses before and after reduction and by post-source decay analysis. However, the remaining four half-cystines (C8, C9, C10, and C11) were located in a three-chain peptide of which one chain contained adjacent half-cystines (C9 and C10). The linkages of C8/C10 and C9/C11 were determined by tandem mass spectrometry of an in-source decay fragment ion containing C9, C10, and C11. This disulfide bond arrangement provides the basis for further refinement of flavivirus NS1 protein structural models.

TI  - Diabetes mellitus as a risk factor for severe dengue fever and West Nile fever: A meta-analysis
JF  - PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 18
AB  - Background Dengue fever (DF) and West Nile fever (WNF) have become endemic worldwide in the last two decades. Studies suggest that individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at a higher risk of developing severe complications from these diseases. Identifying the factors associated with a severe clinical presentation is crucial, as prompt treatment is essential to prevent complications and fatalities. This article aims to summarize and assess the published evidence regarding the link between DM and the risk of severe clinical manifestations in cases of DF and WNF. Methodology/Principal findings A systematic search was conducted using the PubMed and Web of Science databases. 27 studies (19 on DF, 8 on WNF) involving 342,873 laboratory-confirmed patients were included in the analysis. The analysis showed that a diagnosis of DM was associated with an increased risk for severe clinical presentations of both DF (OR 3.39; 95% CI: 2.46, 4.68) and WNF (OR 2.89; 95% CI: 1.89, 4.41). DM also significantly increased the risk of death from both diseases (DF: OR 1.95; 95% CI: 1.09, 3.52; WNF: OR 1.74; 95% CI: 1.40, 2.17). Conclusions/Significance This study provides strong evidence supporting the association between DM and an increased risk of severe clinical manifestations in cases of DF and WNF. Diabetic individuals in DF or WNF endemic areas should be closely monitored when presenting with febrile symptoms due to their higher susceptibility to severe disease. Early detection and appropriate management strategies are crucial in reducing the morbidity and mortality rates associated with DF and WNF in diabetic patients. Tailored care and targeted public health interventions are needed to address this at-risk population. Further research is required to understand the underlying mechanisms and develop effective preventive and therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Differences in activation and tissue homing markers of natural killer cell subsets during acute dengue infection
JF  - Immunology
VL  - 153
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is considered one of the most important mosquito‐borne diseases. It causes a spectrum of illness that could be due to qualitative and/or quantitative difference(s) of the natural killer (NK) cell responses during acute DENV infection. This view prompted us to perform a detailed phenotypic comparative characterization of NK cell subsets from DENV‐infected patients with dengue fever (DF), patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and healthy controls. The activation/differentiation molecules, CD69 and CD57 and a variety of tissue homing molecules were analysed on the CD56hi CD16− and CD56lo CD16+ NK cells. Although there was no increase in the frequency of the total NK cells during DENV infection compared with the healthy individuals, there was a significant increase in the frequency of the CD56hi CD16− subset and the frequency of CD69 expression by both NK cell subsets during the febrile phase of infection. We also found an increase in the frequencies of cells expressing CD69 and CD57 in the CD56lo CD16+ subset compared with those in the CD56hi CD16− subset. Moreover, although the CD56lo CD16+ subset contained a high frequency of cells expressing skin‐homing markers, the CD56hi CD16− subset contained a high frequency of cells expressing bone marrow and lymph node trafficking markers. Interestingly, no differences of these NK cell subsets were noted in samples from patients with DF versus those with DHF. These findings suggest that activation and differentiation and the patterns of tissue homing molecules of the two major NK cell subsets are different and that these might play a critical role in the immune response against acute DENV infection.

TI  - Different Associations between DC-SIGN Promoter-336G/A (rs4804803) Polymorphism with Severe Dengue in Asians and South-Central Americans: a Meta-Analysis
JF  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
VL  - 16
AB  - Objective: This study was conducted to identify the association between rs4804803 polymorphism in DC-SIGN with the susceptibility of severe dengue. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted to identify all eligible papers in PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Google Scholar. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to assess the association. Subgroup analyses were performed by ethnicity. Sensitivity analyses were performed through employing different statistical models (fixed versus random effect model). Results: A total of nine papers and 12 studies, with 1520 severe dengue and 1496 clinical dengue infection were included. The overall meta-analysis revealed significant associations between rs4804803 and severe dengue under the recession (GG versus GA/AA: OR = 0.44, 95%CI, 0.23–0.82) and a codominant model (GG versus AA: OR = 0.43, 95%CI, 0.23–0.81), but sensitivity analysis indicated that the significant pooled ORs were not robust. The subgroup analysis suggested that the carrier of G in rs4804803 was a risk factor for severe dengue under dominant (GG/GA versus AA: OR = 1.86,95%CI, 1.01–3.45), superdominant (GA versus GG/AA: OR = 1.81,95%CI, 1.02–3.21) and a codominant (GA versus AA: OR=1.82,95%CI, 1.02–3.26) models in Asians, while it was a protective factor for severe dengue in South-central Americans under recessive (GG versus GA/AA: OR = 0.27,95%CI, 0.10–0.70) and codominant (GG versus AA: OR=0.24,95%CI, 0.09–0.64) models. The results from subgroup analysis were robust. Conclusions: Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) promoter-336G/A (rs4804803) polymorphism is association with severe dengue, and it acts in different directions for Asians and South-central Americans.

TI  - Different Responses in MMP/TIMP Expression of U937 and HepG2 Cells to Dengue Virus Infection.
JF  - Japanese journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 68 3
SP  - 221
EP  - 9
AB  - Disease severities following dengue virus (DV) infection are the result of increased vascular permeability leading to hypovolemic shock. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are believed to play a key role in promoting such severities. A previous study reported that supernatants of DV-infected dendritic cells (DCs), which contained high levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9, induced vascular leakage in a mouse model. In the present study, we investigated whether hepatocytes (HepG2) and monocytes (U937) could be additional sources of MMPs during DV infection. HepG2 and U937 cells were exposed to DV serotype 2 strain 16681. The secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was detected using gelatin zymography. We found that DV infection in the HepG2 cells promoted MMP-2 production while that in the U937 cells promoted MMP-9 production. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR results also confirmed that DV infection in the HepG2 cells up-regulated the expression of MMP-2 mRNA, whereas that in the U937 cells enhanced the expression of MMP-9 mRNA. We monitored the expression of endogenous TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. DV infection induced TIMP-1 expression in the U937 cells. However, lower expression of TIMP-2 was observed in the infected HepG2 cells. We believed that following DV infection, monocytes and hepatocytes can act as MMP-9 and MMP-2 producers, respectively. Their responses could be attributed to the disturbance of TIMP expression by DV in different cell types.

AB  - Radio binding assay and dot-virus protein binding assay were carried out to study the difference in binding of the brush border membrane fraction (BBMF) in Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae). The BBMF of Ae. albopictus displayed higher saturation and relative binding characteristics, while the BBMF of Cx. quinquefasciatus showed low saturation and non-relativity. The virus overlay protein-binding assay was then adopted to detect virus-binding protein in the midgut of the two mosquitoes. We detected one 35-kDa virus binding protein in the midgut of Ae. albopictus, whereas none was found in the midgut of Cx. quinquefasciatus. The relationship between dengue-2 virus binding to the midgut of mosquitoes, and the mosquito mesenteron infection barrier against dengue 2 virus are discussed.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79

EP  - 2439
AB  - ABSTRACT Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role as major targets of dengue virus (DV) infections and initiators of antiviral immune responses. Previous observations showed that DCs are activated by infection, presumably acquiring the capacity to promote cell-mediated immunity. However, separate evaluations of the maturation profiles of infected and uninfected bystander cells show that infection impairs the ability of DCs to upregulate cell surface expression of costimulatory, maturation, and major histocompatibility complex molecules, resulting in reduced T-cell stimulatory capacity. Infected DCs failed to respond to tumor necrosis factor alpha as an additional maturation stimulus and were apoptotic. Interleukin 10 (IL-10) was detected in supernatants from cultures of DV-infected DCs and cocultures of DCs and T cells. Taken together, these results constitute an immune evasion strategy used by DV that directly impairs antigen-presenting cell function by maturation blockade and induction of apoptosis.

TI  - Differential Enhancement of Dengue Virus Immune Complex Infectivity Mediated by Signaling-Competent and Signaling-Incompetent Human FcγRIA (CD64) or FcγRIIA (CD32)
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 10128
EP  - 10138
AB  - ABSTRACT Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-mediated entry of infectious dengue virus immune complexes into monocytes/macrophages is hypothesized to be a key event in the pathogenesis of complicated dengue fever. FcγRIA (CD64) and FcγRIIA (CD32), which predominate on the surface of such dengue virus-permissive cells, were compared for their influence on the infectivity of dengue 2 virus immune complexes formed with human dengue virus antibodies. A signaling immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) incorporated into the accessory γ-chain subunit that associates with FcγRIA and constitutively in FcγRIIA is required for phagocytosis mediated by these receptors. To determine whether FcγRIA and FcγRIIA activation functions are also required for internalization of infectious dengue virus immune complexes, we generated native and signaling-incompetent versions of each receptor by site-directed mutagenesis of ITAM tyrosine residues. Plasmids designed to express these receptors were transfected into COS-7 cells, and dengue virus replication was measured by plaque assay and flow cytometry. We found that both receptors mediated enhanced dengue virus immune complex infectivity but that FcγRIIA appeared to do so far more effectively. Abrogation of FcγRIA signaling competency, either by expression without γ-chain or by coexpression with γ-chain mutants, was associated with significant impairment of phagocytosis and of dengue virus immune complex infectivity. Abrogation of FcγRIIA signaling competency was also associated with equally impaired phagocytosis but had no discernible effect on dengue virus immune complex infectivity. These findings point to fundamental differences between FcγRIA and FcγRIIA with respect to their immune-enhancing capabilities and suggest that different mechanisms of dengue virus immune complex internalization may operate between these FcγRs.

TI  - Differential Expression of Human MicroRNAs During Dengue Virus Infection in THP-1 Monocytes
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most widespread arbovirus, responsible for a wide range of clinical manifestations, varying from self-limited illness to severe hemorrhagic fever. Dengue severity is associated with host intense proinflammatory response and monocytes have been considered one of the key cell types involved in the early steps of DENV infection and immunopathogenesis. To better understand cellular mechanisms involved in monocyte infection by DENV, we analyzed the expression levels of 754 human microRNAs in DENV-infected THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line. Eleven human microRNAs showed differential expression after DENV infection and gene ontology and enrichment analysis revealed biological processes potentially affected by these molecules. Five downregulated microRNAs were significantly linked to cellular response to stress, four to cell death/apoptosis, two to innate immune responses and one upregulated to vesicle mediated, TGF-β signaling, phosphatidylinositol mediated signaling, lipid metabolism process and blood coagulation.

TI  - Differential Expression of Toll-like Receptors in Dendritic Cells of Patients with Dengue during Early and Late Acute Phases of the Disease
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 7
AB  - Background Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is observed in individuals that have pre-existing heterotypic dengue antibodies and is associated with increased viral load and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines early in infection. Interestingly, a recent study showed that dengue virus infection in the presence of antibodies resulted in poor stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), thereby facilitating virus particle production, and also suggesting that TLRs may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated the expression levels of TLR2, 3, 4 and 9 and the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 by flow cytometry. This was evaluated in monocytes, in myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (mDCs and pDCs) from 30 dengue patients with different clinical outcomes and in 20 healthy controls. Increased expression of TLR3 and TLR9 in DCs of patients with dengue fever (DF) early in infection was detected. In DCs from patients with severe manifestations, poor stimulation of TLR3 and TLR9 was observed. In addition, we found a lower expression of TLR2 in patients with DF compared to DHF. Expression levels of TLR4 were not affected. Furthermore, the expression of CD80 and CD86 was altered in mDCs and CD86 in pDCs of severe dengue cases. We show that interferon alpha production decreased in the presence of dengue virus after stimulation of PBMCs with the TLR9 agonist (CpG A). This suggests that the virus can affect the interferon response through this signaling pathway. Conclusions/Significance These results show that during dengue disease progression, the expression profile of TLRs changes depending on the severity of the disease. Changes in TLRs expression could play a central role in DC activation, thereby influencing the innate immune response.

TI  - Differential Gene Expression Pattern of Importin β3 and NS5 in C6/36 Cells Acutely and Persistently Infected with Dengue Virus 2
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - The establishment of persistent dengue virus infection within the cells of the mosquito vector is an essential requirement for viral transmission to a new human host. The mechanisms involved in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infection are not well understood, but it has been suggested that both viral and cellular factors might play an important role. In the present work, we evaluated differential gene expression in Aedes albopictus cells acutely (C6/36-HT) and persistently infected (C6-L) with Dengue virus 2 by cDNA-AFLP. We observed that importin β3 was upregulated in noninfected cells compared with C6-L cells. Using RT-qPCR and plaque assays, we observed that Dengue virus levels in C6-L cells essentially do not vary over time, and peak viral titers in acutely infected cells are observed at 72 and 120 h postinfection. The expression level of importin β3 was higher in acutely infected cells than in persistently infected cells; this correlates with higher levels of NS5 in the nucleus of the cell. The differential pattern of importin β3 expression between acute and persistent infection with Dengue virus 2 could be a mechanism to maintain viral infection over time, reducing the antiviral response of the cell and the viral replicative rate.

TI  - Differential Modulation of prM Cleavage, Extracellular Particle Distribution, and Virus Infectivity by Conserved Residues at Nonfurin Consensus Positions of the Dengue Virus pr-M Junction
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 10776
EP  - 10791
AB  - ABSTRACT In the generation of flavivirus particles, an internal cleavage of the envelope glycoprotein prM by furin is required for the acquisition of infectivity. Unlike cleavage of the prM of other flaviviruses, cleavage of dengue virus prM is incomplete in many cell lines; the partial cleavage reflects the influence of residues at furin nonconsensus positions of the pr-M junction, as flaviviruses share basic residues at positions P1, P2, and P4, recognized by furin. In this study, viruses harboring the alanine-scanning and other multiple-point mutations of the pr-M junction were generated, employing a dengue virus background that exhibited 60 to 70% prM cleavage and a preponderance of virion-sized extracellular particles. Analysis of prM and its cleavage products in viable mutants revealed a cleavage-suppressive effect at the conserved P3 Glu residue, as well as the cleavage-augmenting effects at the P5 Arg and P6 His residues, indicating an interplay between opposing modulatory influences mediated by these residues on the cleavage of the pr-M junction. Changes in the prM cleavage level were associated with altered proportions of extracellular virions and subviral particles; mutants with reduced cleavage were enriched with subviral particles and prM-containing virions, whereas the mutant with enhanced cleavage was deprived of these particles. Alterations of virus multiplication were detected in mutants with reduced prM cleavage and were correlated with their low specific infectivities. These findings define the functional roles of charged residues located adjacent to the furin consensus sequence in the cleavage of dengue virus prM and provide plausible mechanisms by which the reduction in the pr-M junction cleavability may affect virus replication.

TI  - Differential Protein Modulation in Midguts of Aedes aegypti Infected with Chikungunya and Dengue 2 Viruses
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 5
AB  - Background Arthropod borne virus infections cause several emerging and resurgent infectious diseases. Among the diseases caused by arboviruses, dengue and chikungunya are responsible for a high rate of severe human diseases worldwide. The midgut of mosquitoes is the first barrier for pathogen transmission and is a target organ where arboviruses must replicate prior to infecting other organs. A proteomic approach was undertaken to characterize the key virus/vector interactions and host protein modifications that happen in the midgut for viral transmission to eventually take place. Methodology and Principal Findings Using a proteomics differential approach with two-Dimensional Differential in-Gel Electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), we defined the protein modulations in the midgut of Aedes aegypti that were triggered seven days after an oral infection (7 DPI) with dengue 2 (DENV-2) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses. Gel profile comparisons showed that the level of 18 proteins was modulated by DENV-2 only and 12 proteins were modulated by CHIKV only. Twenty proteins were regulated by both viruses in either similar or different ways. Both viruses caused an increase of proteins involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species, energy production, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Midgut infection by DENV-2 and CHIKV triggered an antioxidant response. CHIKV infection produced an increase of proteins involved in detoxification. Conclusion/Significance Our study constitutes the first analysis of the protein response of Aedes aegypti's midgut infected with viruses belonging to different families. It shows that the differentially regulated proteins in response to viral infection include structural, redox, regulatory proteins, and enzymes for several metabolic pathways. Some of these proteins like antioxidant are probably involved in cell protection. On the other hand, we propose that the modulation of other proteins like transferrin, hsp60 and alpha glucosidase, may favour virus survival, replication and transmission, suggesting a subversion of the insect cell metabolism by the arboviruses.

TI  - Differential Proteomic Profiling at Different Phases of Dengue Infection: An Intricate Insight from Proteins to Pathogenesis.
JF  - Journal of proteome research
AB  - Dengue fever is a rapidly emerging tropical disease and an important cause of morbidity in its severe form worldwide. A wide spectrum of the pathophysiology is associated with the transition of dengue fever to severe dengue, which is driven by the host immune response and might reflect in patients' proteome profile. This study aims to analyze the plasma from different phases of dengue-infected patients at two time points. A mass-spectrometry-based proteomic approach was utilized to understand the involvement of probable candidate proteins toward developing a more severe, hemorrhagic form of dengue fever. Dengue-infected hospital-admitted patients with <5 days of fever were included in this study. Patient samples from the acute phase were screened for the presence of NS1 antigen using ELISA and subjected to molecular serotyping. Dengue molecular serotype-confirmed patient samples, pairwise from acute and critical phases with healthy control were subjected to qualitative and quantitative proteomic analysis, and then pathway analysis was performed. The protein-protein interaction network between the dengue virus and host proteins was depicted in the search for proteins associated with severe dengue pathophysiology. An array of apolipoprotein, cytokines, and endothelial proteins in association with virus replication and endothelial dysfunction were validated as biomolecules involved in severe dengue pathophysiology.

EP  - 9372
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus cycles between mosquitoes and humans. Each host provides a different environment for viral replication, imposing different selective pressures. We identified a sequence in the dengue virus genome that is essential for viral replication in mosquito cells but not in mammalian cells. This sequence is located at the viral 3′ untranslated region and folds into a small hairpin structure. A systematic mutational analysis using dengue virus infectious clones and reporter viruses allowed the determination of two putative functions in this cis-acting RNA motif, one linked to the structure and the other linked to the nucleotide sequence. We found that single substitutions that did not alter the hairpin structure did not affect dengue virus replication in mammalian cells but abolished replication in mosquito cells. This is the first sequence identified in a flavivirus genome that is exclusively required for viral replication in insect cells.

TI  - Differential Requirements in Endocytic Trafficking for Penetration of Dengue Virus
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - The entry of DENV into the host cell appears to be a very complex process which has been started to be studied in detail. In this report, the route of functional intracellular trafficking after endocytic uptake of dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) strain HW, DENV-2 strain NGC and DENV-2 strain 16681 into Vero cells was studied by using a susceptibility to ammonium chloride assay, dominant negative mutants of several members of the family of cellular Rab GTPases that participate in regulation of transport through endosome vesicles and immunofluorescence colocalization. Together, the results presented demonstrate that in spite of the different internalization route among viral serotypes in Vero cells and regardless of the viral strain, DENV particles are first transported to early endosomes in a Rab5-dependent manner. Then a Rab7-dependent pathway guides DENV-2 16681 to late endosomes, whereas a yet unknown sorting event controls the transport of DENV-2 NGC, and most probably DENV-1 HW, to the perinuclear recycling compartments where fusion membrane would take place releasing nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. Besides the demonstration of a different intracellular trafficking for two DENV-2 strains that shared the initial clathrin-independent internalization route, these studies proved for the first time the involvement of the slow recycling pathway for DENV-2 productive infection.

TI  - Differential Targeting of Viral Components by CD4+ versus CD8+ T Lymphocytes in Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 2693
EP  - 2706
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is the principal arthropod-borne viral pathogen afflicting human populations. While repertoires of antibodies to DENV have been linked to protection or enhanced infection, the role of T lymphocytes in these processes remains poorly defined. This study provides a comprehensive overview of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitope reactivities against the DENV 2 proteome in adult patients experiencing secondary DENV infection. Dengue virus-specific T cell responses directed against an overlapping 15mer peptide library spanning the DENV 2 proteome were analyzed ex vivo by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay, and recognition of individual peptides was further characterized in specific T cell lines. Thirty novel T cell epitopes were identified, 9 of which are CD4+ and 21 are CD8+ T cell epitopes. We observe that whereas CD8+ T cell epitopes preferentially target nonstructural proteins (NS3 and NS5), CD4+ epitopes are skewed toward recognition of viral components that are also targeted by B lymphocytes (envelope, capsid, and NS1). Consistently, a large proportion of dengue virus-specific CD4+ T cells have phenotypic characteristics of circulating follicular helper T cells (CXCR5 expression and production of interleukin-21 or gamma interferon), suggesting that they are interacting with B cells in vivo. This study shows that during a dengue virus infection, the protein targets of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are largely distinct, thus highlighting key differences in the immunodominance of DENV proteins for these two cell types. This has important implications for our understanding of how the two arms of the human adaptive immune system are differentially targeted and employed as part of our response to DENV infection.

TI  - Differential and convergent utilization of autophagy components by positive-strand RNA viruses
JF  - PLoS Biology
VL  - 17
AB  - Many viruses interface with the autophagy pathway, a highly conserved process for recycling cellular components. For three viral infections in which autophagy constituents are proviral (poliovirus, dengue, and Zika), we developed a panel of knockouts (KOs) of autophagy-related genes to test which components of the canonical pathway are utilized. We discovered that each virus uses a distinct set of initiation components; however, all three viruses utilize autophagy-related gene 9 (ATG9), a lipid scavenging protein, and LC3 (light-chain 3), which is involved in membrane curvature. These results show that viruses use noncanonical routes for membrane sculpting and LC3 recruitment. By measuring viral RNA abundance, we also found that poliovirus utilizes these autophagy components for intracellular growth, while dengue and Zika virus only use autophagy components for post-RNA replication processes. Comparing how RNA viruses manipulate the autophagy pathway reveals new noncanonical autophagy routes, explains the exacerbation of disease by starvation, and uncovers common targets for antiviral drugs.

TI  - Differential display RT‐PCR analysis of ECV304 endothelial‐like cells infected with dengue virus type 2 reveals messenger RNA expression profiles of multiple human genes involved in known and novel roles
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 72
AB  - Differential display (DD)‐RT‐PCR was employed to analyze mRNAs from ECV304 human endothelial‐like cells undergoing apoptosis following infection with the virulent New Guinea C strain of dengue virus type 2 in order to elucidate the cellular gene responses to dengue viral infection at the transcriptional level. We isolated, sequenced, and identified 203 differentially expressed and overlapping cDNA fragments, all of which were of human origin except 1 that was of viral origin. Out of these, 78 were individual distinct clones comprising 46 and 32 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that exhibited upregulated and downregulated trends, respectively. Of the 78 differentially expressed mRNAs, 16 did not match any characterized genes or ESTs. The remaining 62 mRNAs modified by dengue virus infection matched known genes, including those encoding components of the cell cycle (Anillin, CDC27), cytoskeleton (ε‐tubulin), signal transduction (OPHN1, PPP2R2A, TIRAP), protein translation and modification (EIF3S10, IF2, TMEM1), transcriptional regulation (α‐NAC, C20orf104, EGR1, ELP2), apoptotic cell death (RICK), membrane (BPAG1), and mitochondrial‐related proteins. Semiquantitative RT‐PCR and real‐time RT‐PCR authenticated further the altered expression patterns of selected genes of interest. These data demonstrate the feasibility of mRNA DD in providing insights into the complex responses of the transcriptional machinery of permissive and apoptotic human endothelial‐like cells in the pathogenesis of dengue and/or its complications induced by the virulent dengue virus type 2.

TI  - Differential expression analysis and profiling of hepatic miRNA and isomiRNA in dengue hemorrhagic fever
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue virus causes dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and has been associated to fatal cases worldwide. The liver is one of the most important target tissues in severe cases, due to its intense viral replication and metabolic role. microRNAs role during infection is crucial to understand the regulatory mechanisms of DENV infection and can help in diagnostic and anti-viral therapies development. We sequenced the miRNome of six fatal cases and compared to five controls, to characterize the human microRNAs expression profile in the liver tissue during DHF. Eight microRNAs were differentially expressed, including miR-126-5p, a regulatory molecule of endothelial cells, miR-122-5p, a liver specific homeostasis regulator, and miR-146a-5p, an interferon-regulator. Enrichment analysis with predicted target genes of microRNAs revealed regulatory pathways of apoptosis, involving MAPK, RAS, CDK and FAS. Immune response pathways were related to NF- kB, CC and CX families, IL and TLR. This is the first description of the human microRNA and isomicroRNA profile in liver tissues from DHF cases. The results demonstrated the association of miR-126-5p, miR-122-5p and miR-146a-5p with DHF liver pathogenesis, involving endothelial repair and vascular permeability regulation, control of homeostasis and expression of inflammatory cytokines.

TI  - Differential expression of microRNA, miR-150 and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in peripheral blood cells as early prognostic markers of severe forms of dengue
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 27
AB  - Dengue presents a wide clinical spectrum. Most patients recover following a self-limiting non-severe clinical course. A small proportion of patients progress to severe disease, mostly characterized by plasma leakage with or without hemorrhage. Early symptoms of severe dengue (SD) are similar to those of non-severe dengue fever (DF). Severe symptoms manifest after 3–5 days of fever, which can be life threatening due to lack of proper medications and inability to distinguish severe cases during the early stages. Early prediction of SD in patients with no warning signs who may later develop severe infection is very important for proper disease management to alleviate related complications and mortality. microRNA are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression. Due to the remarkable stability and the role of microRNA in gene expression, altered expression of microRNA was evaluated to explore clinically relevant prognostic markers of severe dengue. The relative expression of microRNA hsa-let-7e (let-7e), hsa-miR-30b-5p (miR-30b), hsa-miR-30e-3p (miR-30e), hsa-miR-33a (miR-33a), and hsa-miR-150-5p (miR-150) and several putative target genes in peripheral blood cells (PBC) collected from 20 DF and 20 SD positive patients within 4 days from fever onset was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). miR-150 showed significant (P < 0.01) up regulation in PBC of SD patients compared to DF patients during the acute phase of infection. Expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was significantly (P < 0.01) down regulated indicating that genes involved in epigenetic regulation are also differentially expressed in SD patients during the early stage of infection. Differential expression of microRNA miR-150 and the putative target gene EZH2 may serve as reliable biomarkers of disease severity during early stages of dengue infection.

AB  - Dengue presents a wide clinical spectrum including asymptomatic dengue fever (DF) or severe forms, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Early symptoms of DHF are similar to those of non-life-threatening DF. Severe symptoms manifest after 3-5 days of fever, which can be life threatening due to lack of proper medications and inability to distinguish severe cases during the early stages. Early prediction of severe dengue in patients with no warning signs who may later develop severe infection is very important for proper disease management to alleviate DHF related complications and mortality. Due to the role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and remarkable stability of microRNA, altered expression of microRNA was evaluated to explore clinically relevant biomarkers.The relative expression of microRNA hsa-let-7e, hsa-miR-30b-5p, hsa-miR-30e-3p, hsa-miR-33a, and hsa-miR-150-5p and several putative target genes in peripheral blood cells (PBC) collected from 20 DF and 20 DHF positive patients within four days from fever onset was evaluated by qRT-PCR. hsa-miR-150-5p showed significant (P<0.05) up regulation in PBC of DHF patients compared to DF patients during the acute phase of infection. Expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was significantly (P<0.05) down regulated indicating that genes involved in epigenetic regulation are also differentially expressed in DHF patients during the early stage of infection.Differential expression of microRNA miR-150-5p and the putative target gene EZH2 may serve as reliable biomarkers of disease severity during early stages of dengue infection.Severe dengue cannot be distinguished from dengue fever during the early stages of infection based on the clinical symptoms. A diagnosis is only made after the patient is presented with severe manifestations such as plasma leakage and hemorrhage. During a dengue outbreak, this leads to high occupancy of hospital beds. However, only a small percentage of patients present with severe symptoms and the others do not require medical care at a hospital. Therefore, early prognosis of severe manifestations could reduce dengue related mortality by identifying the patients who will benefit from hospitalization and early intervention. We demonstrate that severe dengue in Sri Lankan patients is associated with increased expression of miRNA miR150 and decreased expression of EZH2 during the early stages of infection when none of the patients showed symptoms of developing severe manifestations at later stages of infection.

AB  - Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are hypothesized to play a role in clearance during primary dengue virus (DENV) infections, and contribute to immunopathology during secondary heterologous infections in humans. We previously reported skewed T-cell responses to secondary DENV infection in BALB/c (H-2(d)) mice, reproducing characteristics of human DENV infection. To set the stage for using widely available transgenic and knockout mice, we extended these studies to identify DENV-specific T-cell responses in C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) mice. We identified dominant CD8+ T-cell responses to H-2D(b)-restricted epitopes on the DENV NS4a (aa 249-265) and NS5 (aa 521-537) proteins. High frequencies of IFN-γ- and TNF-α-producing T cells directed at both epitopes were detected following primary infection with all four DENV serotypes, and were augmented by secondary DENV infections. In vivo cytotoxicity assays demonstrated rapid clearance of target cells pulsed with the NS4a peptide; in contrast, NS5 peptide-pulsed target cells were poorly cleared in vivo. These data characterize two H-2(b)-restricted T-cell epitopes displaying divergent in vivo function. These results should facilitate further studies of the in vivo effects of DENV-specific T cells, including the use of genetically modified mouse strains.

TI  - Differential regulation of toll‐like receptor‐2, toll‐like receptor‐4, CD16 and human leucocyte antigen‐DR on peripheral blood monocytes during mild and severe dengue fever
JF  - Immunology
VL  - 130
AB  - Dengue fever (DF), a public health problem in tropical countries, may present severe clinical manifestations as result of increased vascular permeability and coagulation disorders. Dengue virus (DENV), detected in peripheral monocytes during acute disease and in in vitro infection, leads to cytokine production, indicating that virus–target cell interactions are relevant to pathogenesis. Here we investigated the in vitro and in vivo activation of human peripheral monocytes after DENV infection. The numbers of CD14+ monocytes expressing the adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM‐1) were significantly increased during acute DF. A reduced number of CD14+ human leucocyte antigen (HLA)‐DR+ monocytes was observed in patients with severe dengue when compared to those with mild dengue and controls; CD14+ monocytes expressing toll‐like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 were increased in peripheral blood from dengue patients with mild disease, but in vitro DENV‐2 infection up‐regulated only TLR2. Increased numbers of CD14+ CD16+ activated monocytes were found after in vitro and in vivo DENV‐2 infection. The CD14high CD16+ monocyte subset was significantly expanded in mild dengue, but not in severe dengue. Increased plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ) and interleukin (IL)‐18 in dengue patients were inversely associated with CD14high CD16+, indicating that these cells might be involved in controlling exacerbated inflammatory responses, probably by IL‐10 production. We showed here, for the first time, phenotypic changes on peripheral monocytes that were characteristic of cell activation. A sequential monocyte‐activation model is proposed in which DENV infection triggers TLR2/4 expression and inflammatory cytokine production, leading eventually to haemorrhagic manifestations, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorders, plasmatic leakage and shock development, but may also produce factors that act in order to control both intense immunoactivation and virus replication.

JF  - Journal of infection in developing countries
VL  - 8 7
SP  - 876
EP  - 84
AB  - INTRODUCTION
Different dengue virus (DENV) serotypes have been associated with greater epidemic potential. In turn, the increased frequency in cases of severe forms of dengue has been associated with the cocirculation of several serotypes. Because Colombia is a country with an endemic presence of all four DENV serotypes, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo and in vitro replication of the DENV-2 and DENV-3 strains under individual infection and coinfection conditions.


METHODOLOGY
C6/36HT cells were infected with the two strains individually or simultaneously (coinfection). Replication capacity was evaluated by RT-qPCR, and the effects on cell viability were assessed with an MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Additionally, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were artificially fed the two strains of each serotype individually or simultaneously. The viral genomes were quantified by RT-qPCR and the survival of the infected mosquitoes was compared to that of uninfected controls.


RESULTS
In single infections, three strains significantly affected C6/36HT cell viability, but no significant differences were found in the replication capacities of the strains of the same serotype. In the in vivo infections, mosquito survival was not affected, and no significant differences in replication between strains of the same serotype were found. Finally, in coinfections, serotype 2 replicated with a thousandfold greater efficiency than serotype 3 did both in vitro and in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
Due to the cocirculation of serotypes in endemic regions, further studies of coinfections in a natural environment would further an understanding of the transmission dynamics that affect DENV infection epidemiology.

TI  - Dimerization of Flavivirus NS4B Protein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 3379
EP  - 3391
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus replication is mediated by a complex machinery that consists of viral enzymes, nonenzymatic viral proteins, and host factors. Many of the nonenzymatic viral proteins, such as NS4B, are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. How these membrane proteins function in viral replication is poorly understood. Here we report a robust method to express and purify dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus NS4B proteins. The NS4B proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, reconstituted in dodecyl maltoside (DDM) detergent micelles, and purified to >95% homogeneity. The recombinant NS4B proteins dimerized in vitro, as evidenced by gel filtration, chemical cross-linking, and multiangle light scattering experiments. The dimeric form of NS4B was also detected when the protein was expressed alone in cells as well as in cells infected with DENV type 2 (DENV-2). Mutagenesis analysis showed that the cytosolic loop (amino acids 129 to 165) and the C-terminal region (amino acids 166 to 248) are responsible for NS4B dimerization. trans-Complementation experiments showed that (i) two genome-length RNAs containing distinct NS4B lethal mutations could not trans-complement each other, (ii) the replication defect of NS4B mutant RNA could be restored in cells containing DENV-2 replicons, and (iii) expression of wild-type NS4B protein alone was not sufficient to restore the replication of the NS4B mutant RNA. Collectively, the results indicate that trans-complementation of a lethal NS4B mutant RNA requires wild-type NS4B presented from a replication complex. IMPORTANCE The reported expression and purification system has made it possible to study the biochemistry and structure of flavivirus NS4B proteins. The finding of flavivirus NS4B dimerization and the mapping of regions important for NS4B dimerization provide the possibility to inhibit viral replication through blocking NS4B dimerization. The requirement of NS4B in the context of the replication complex for successful trans-complementation enhances our understanding of NS4B in flavivirus replication.

AB  - ABSTRACT Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are a group of RNA viruses that constitute global threats for human and animal health. Replication of these pathogens is strictly dependent on cellular lipid metabolism. We have evaluated the effect of the pharmacological activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of lipid metabolism, on the infection of three medically relevant flaviviruses, namely, West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and dengue virus (DENV). WNV is responsible for recurrent outbreaks of meningitis and encephalitis, affecting humans and horses worldwide. ZIKV has caused a recent pandemic associated with birth defects (microcephaly), reproductive disorders, and severe neurological complications (Guillain-Barré syndrome). DENV is the etiological agent of the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease, which can induce a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue. Our results showed, for the first time, that activation of AMPK using the specific small molecule activator PF-06409577 reduced WNV, ZIKV, and DENV infection. This antiviral effect was associated with an impairment of viral replication due to the modulation of host cell lipid metabolism exerted by the compound. These results support that the pharmacological activation of AMPK, which currently constitutes an important pharmacological target for human diseases, could also provide a feasible approach for broad-spectrum host-directed antiviral discovery.

TI  - Direct Infection of B Cells by Dengue Virus Modulates B Cell Responses in a Cambodian Pediatric Cohort
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue is an acute viral disease caused by dengue virus (DENV), which is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Symptoms of DENV infection range from inapparent to severe and can be life-threatening. DENV replicates in primary immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages, which contribute to the dissemination of the virus. Susceptibility of other immune cells such as B cells to direct infection by DENV and their subsequent response to infection is not well defined. In a cohort of 60 Cambodian children, we showed that B cells are susceptible to DENV infection. Moreover, we show that B cells can support viral replication of laboratory adapted and patient-derived DENV strains. B cells were permissive to DENV infection albeit low titers of infectious virions were released in cell supernatants CD300a, a phosphatidylserine receptor, was identified as a potential attachment factor or receptor for entry of DENV into B cells. In spite of expressing Fcγ-receptors, antibody-mediated enhancement of DENV infection was not observed in B cells in an in vitro model. Direct infection by DENV induced proliferation of B cells in dengue patients in vivo and plasmablast/plasma cell formation in vitro. To summarize, our results show that B cells are susceptible to direct infection by DENV via CD300a and the subsequent B cell responses could contribute to dengue pathogenesis.

TI  - Direct repeats in the 3' untranslated regions of mosquito-borne flaviviruses: possible implications for virus transmission.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 87 Pt 11
SP  - 3297
EP  - 305
AB  - Direct repeats (DRs) of 20-45 nucleotide conserved sequences (CS) and repeated CS (RCS), separated by non-conserved sequences up to 100 nucleotides long, were previously described in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the three major mosquito-borne flavivirus (MBFV) subgroups, represented by Japanese encephalitis virus, Yellow fever virus and Dengue virus. Each subgroup exhibits a specific pattern of DRs, the biological significance of which has not yet been adequately addressed. The DRs were originally identified using conventional alignment programs based on the assumption that genetic variation is driven primarily by nucleotide substitutions. Since there are no recognized alignment programs that can adequately accommodate very divergent sequences, a method has been devised to construct and analyse a substantially improved 3'UTR alignment between these highly divergent viruses, based on the concept that deletions and/or insertions, in addition to substitutions, are important drivers of 3'UTR evolution. This 'robust alignment' approach demonstrated more extensive homologies in the 3'UTR than had been recognized previously and revealed the presence of similar DRs, either intact or as sequence 'remnants', in all the MBFV subgroups. The relevance of these observations is discussed in relation to (i) the function of DRs as elements of replication enhancement, (ii) the evolution of RNA secondary structures and (iii) the significance of DRs and secondary structures in MBFV transmissibility between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts.

TI  - Discovery of flavivirus-derived endogenous viral elements in Anopheles mosquito genomes supports the existence of Anopheles-associated insect-specific flaviviruses
JF  - Virus Evolution
VL  - 3
AB  - The Flavivirus genus encompasses several arboviruses of public health significance such as dengue, yellow fever, and Zika viruses. It also includes insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) that are only capable of infecting insect hosts. The vast majority of mosquito-infecting flaviviruses have been associated with mosquito species of the Aedes and Culex genera in the Culicinae subfamily, which also includes most arbovirus vectors. Mosquitoes of the Anophelinae subfamily are not considered significant arbovirus vectors; however, flaviviruses have occasionally been detected in field-caught Anopheles specimens. Whether such observations reflect occasional spillover or laboratory contamination or whether Anopheles mosquitoes are natural hosts of flaviviruses is unknown. Here, we provide in silico and in vivo evidence of transcriptionally active, flavivirus-derived endogenous viral elements (EVEs) in the genome of Anopheles minimus and Anopheles sinensis. Such non-retroviral endogenization of RNA viruses is consistent with a shared evolutionary history between flaviviruses and Anopheles mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analyses of the two newly described EVEs support the existence of a distinct clade of Anopheles-associated ISFs.

TI  - Dissecting the Cell Entry Pathway of Dengue Virus by Single-Particle Tracking in Living Cells
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 4
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped RNA virus that causes the most common arthropod-borne infection worldwide. The mechanism by which DENV infects the host cell remains unclear. In this work, we used live-cell imaging and single-virus tracking to investigate the cell entry, endocytic trafficking, and fusion behavior of DENV. Simultaneous tracking of DENV particles and various endocytic markers revealed that DENV enters cells exclusively via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The virus particles move along the cell surface in a diffusive manner before being captured by a pre-existing clathrin-coated pit. Upon clathrin-mediated entry, DENV particles are transported to Rab5-positive endosomes, which subsequently mature into late endosomes through acquisition of Rab7 and loss of Rab5. Fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane was primarily detected in late endosomal compartments.

TI  - Dissemination of the Flavivirus Subgenomic Replicon Genome and Viral Proteins by Extracellular Vesicles
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes have been shown to play physiological roles in cell-to-cell communication by delivering various proteins and nucleic acids. In addition, several studies revealed that the EVs derived from the cells that are infected with certain viruses could transfer the full-length viral genomes, resulting in EVs-mediated virus propagation. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that the prepared EVs were contaminated with infectious viral particles. In this study, the cells that harbor subgenomic replicon derived from the Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue virus without producing any replication-competent viruses were employed as the EV donor. It was demonstrated that the EVs in the culture supernatants of those cells were able to transfer the replicon genome to other cells of various types. It was also shown that the EVs were incorporated by the recipient cells primarily through macropinocytosis after interaction with CD33 and Tim-1/Tim-4 on HeLa and K562 cells, respectively. Since the methods used in this study are free from contamination with infectious viral particles, it is unequivocally indicated that the flavivirus genome can be transferred by EVs from cell to cell, suggesting that this pathway, in addition to the classical receptor-mediated infection, may play some roles in the viral propagation and pathogenesis.

TI  - Distinct Antiviral Roles for Human 2′,5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Family Members against Dengue Virus Infection1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 183
SP  - 8035
EP  - 8043
AB  - The 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and its downstream effector RNase L play important roles in host defense against virus infection. Oas1b, one of the eight Oas1 genes in the mouse genome, has been identified as a murine flavivirus-resistance gene. Four genes, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OAS-like (OASL), have been identified in the human OAS gene family, and 10 isoforms, including OAS1 (p42, p44, p46, p48, and p52), OAS2 (p69 and p71), OAS3 (p100), and OASL (p30 and p59) can be generated by alternative splicing. In this study, we determined the role of the human OAS/RNase L pathway in host defense against dengue virus (DEN) infection and assessed the antiviral potential of each isoform in the human OAS family. DEN replication was reduced by overexpression and enhanced by knockdown of RNase L expression, indicating a protective role for RNase L against DEN replication in human cells. The human OAS1 p42, OAS1 p46, and OAS3 p100, but not the other OAS isoforms, blocked DEN replication via an RNase L-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, the anti-DEN activities of these three OAS isoforms correlated with their ability to trigger RNase L activation in DEN-infected cells. Thus, OAS1 p42/p46 and OAS3 p100 are likely to contribute to host defense against DEN infection and play a role in determining the outcomes of DEN disease severity.

TI  - Distinct RIG-I and MDA5 Signaling by RNA Viruses in Innate Immunity
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 335
EP  - 345
AB  - ABSTRACT Alpha/beta interferon immune defenses are essential for resistance to viruses and can be triggered through the actions of the cytoplasmic helicases retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). Signaling by each is initiated by the recognition of viral products such as RNA and occurs through downstream interaction with the IPS-1 adaptor protein. We directly compared the innate immune signaling requirements of representative viruses of the Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Reoviridae for RIG-I, MDA5, and interferon promoter-stimulating factor 1 (IPS-1). In cultured fibroblasts, IPS-1 was essential for innate immune signaling of downstream interferon regulatory factor 3 activation and interferon-stimulated gene expression, but the requirements for RIG-I and MDA5 were variable. Each was individually dispensable for signaling triggered by reovirus and dengue virus, whereas RIG-I was essential for signaling by influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and human respiratory syncytial virus. Functional genomics analyses identified cellular genes triggered during influenza A virus infection whose expression was strictly dependent on RIG-I and which are involved in processes of innate or adaptive immunity, apoptosis, cytokine signaling, and inflammation associated with the host response to contemporary and pandemic strains of influenza virus. These results define IPS-1-dependent signaling as an essential feature of host immunity to RNA virus infection. Our observations further demonstrate differential and redundant roles for RIG-I and MDA5 in pathogen recognition and innate immune signaling that may reflect unique and shared biologic properties of RNA viruses whose differential triggering and control of gene expression may impact pathogenesis and infection.

TI  - Distinct Roles of Hemocytes at Different Stages of Infection by Dengue and Zika Viruses in Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are vectors for arboviruses of medical importance such as dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses. Different innate immune pathways contribute to the control of arboviruses in the mosquito vector including RNA interference, Toll and Jak-STAT pathways. However, the role of cellular responses mediated by circulating macrophage-like cells known as hemocytes remains unclear. Here we show that hemocytes are recruited to the midgut of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in response to DENV or ZIKV. Blockade of the phagocytic function of hemocytes using latex beads induced increased accumulation of hemocytes in the midgut and a reduction in virus infection levels in this organ. In contrast, inhibition of phagocytosis by hemocytes led to increased systemic dissemination and replication of DENV and ZIKV. Hence, our work reveals a dual role for hemocytes in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, whereby phagocytosis is not required to control viral infection in the midgut but is essential to restrict systemic dissemination. Further understanding of the mechanism behind this duality could help the design of vector-based strategies to prevent transmission of arboviruses.

TI  - Does prior exposure to larvicides influence dengue virus susceptibility in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)?
AB  - Control of mosquito vector populations is primarily intended to reduce the transmission of pathogens they transmit. Use of chemical controls, such as larvicides, can have unforeseen consequences on adult traits if not applied properly. The consequences of under application of larvicides are little studied, specifically the impacts on pathogen infection and transmission by the vectors that survive exposure to larvicides. We compared vector susceptibility of Aedes aegypti (L.) for dengue virus, serotype 1 (DENV-1) previously exposed as larvae to an LC50 of different classes of insecticides as formulated larvicides. Larval exposure to insect growth regulators (methoprene and pyriproxyfen) significantly increased susceptibility to infection of DENV-1 in Ae. aegypti adults but did not alter disseminated infection or transmission. Larval exposure to temephos, spinosad, and Bti did not increase infection, disseminated infection, or transmission of DENV-1. Our findings describe a previously under observed phenomenon, the latent effects of select larvicides on mosquito vector susceptibility for arboviruses. These data suggest that there are unintended consequences of sublethal exposure to select larvicides that can influence susceptibility of Ae. aegypti to DENV infection, and indicates the need for further investigation of sublethal effects of insecticides on other aspects of mosquito biology, especially those parameters relevant to a mosquitoes ability to transmit arboviruses (life span, biting behavior, extrinsic incubation period).

TI  - Double‐faced implication of CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells expanded by acute dengue infection via TLR2/MyD88 pathway
JF  - European Journal of Immunology
VL  - 50
AB  - Dengue infection causes dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs are expanded in patients during dengue infection, and appear to be associated with clinical severity. However, molecular pathways involved in Treg proliferation and the reason for their insufficient control of severe diseases are poorly understood. Here, dengue infection induced the proliferation of functional CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs via TLR2/MyD88 pathway. Surface TLR2 on Tregs was responsible for their proliferation, and dengue‐expanded Tregs subverted in vivo differentiation of effector CD8+ T cells. An additional interesting finding was that dengue‐infected hosts displayed changed levels of susceptibility to other diseases in TLR2‐dependent manner. This change included enhanced susceptibility to tumors and bacterial infection, but highly enhanced resistance to viral infection. Further, the transfer of dengue‐proliferated Tregs protected the recipients from dengue‐induced DHF/DSS and LPS‐induced sepsis. In contrast, dengue‐infected hosts were more susceptible to sepsis, an effect attributable to early TLR2‐dependent production of proinflammatory cytokines. These facts may explain the reason why in some patients, dengue‐proliferated Tregs is insufficient to control DF and DHF/DSS. Also, our observations lead to new insights into Treg responses activated by dengue infection in a TLR2‐dependent manner, which could differentially act on subsequent exposure to other disease‐producing situations.

TI  - Down Regulation Of IL-1β Secretion By Tgf-β1 In Macrophages Infected With Dengue Virus
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Several pathogenic mechanisms have been linked to the severity of dengue virus infection, like viral cytotoxicity, underlying host genetics and comorbidities such as diabetes and dyslipidemia. It has been observed that patients with severe manifestations develop an uncontrolled immune response, with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-6 and chemokines that damage the human microvascular endothelium, and also in anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β1. The role of TGF-β1 on dengue is not clear; few studies have been published, and most of them from patient sera data, with both protective and pathological roles have described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of TGF-β1 to regulate the secretion of IL-1β in macrophages infected by DENV using THP-1 cells treated with recombinant TGF-β1 before or after DENV infection. By RT-PCR we did not observe a difference in IL-1β expression between infected cells pretreated with TGF-β1 and those that were not. However, secretion of IL-1β was reduced only in cells stimulated with TGF-β1 before infection, and not in those treated 2 hours post-infection. TGF-β1 receptor blockage with SB505124 inhibitor, prior to the addition of TGF-β1 and infection, abrogated the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1. Our results suggest that DENV could regulate the function of TGF-β1 on macrophages. This negative regulation of the TGF-β1 pathway could be used by DENV to evade the immune response and could contribute to the immunopathology.

TI  - Down-Regulation of Complement Receptors on the Surface of Host Monocyte Even as In Vitro Complement Pathway Blocking Interferes in Dengue Infection
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - In dengue virus (DENV) infection, complement system (CS) activation appears to have protective and pathogenic effects. In severe dengue fever (DF), the levels of DENV non-structural-1 protein and of the products of complement activation, including C3a, C5a and SC5b-9, are higher before vascular leakage occurs, supporting the hypothesis that complement activation contributes to unfavourable outcomes. The clinical manifestations of DF range from asymptomatic to severe and even fatal. Here, we aimed to characterise CS by their receptors or activation product, in vivo in DF patients and in vitro by DENV-2 stimulation on monocytes. In comparison with healthy controls, DF patients showed lower expression of CR3 (CD11b), CR4 (CD11c) and, CD59 on monocytes. The DF patients who were high producers of SC5b-9 were also those that showed more pronounced bleeding or vascular leakage. Those findings encouraged us to investigate the role of CS in vitro, using monocytes isolated from healthy subjects. Prior blocking with CR3 alone (CD11b) or CR3 (CD11b/CD18) reduced viral infection, as quantified by the levels of intracellular viral antigen expression and soluble DENV non-structural viral protein. However, we found that CR3 alone (CD11b) or CR3 (CD11b/CD18) blocking did not influence major histocompatibility complex presentation neither active caspase-1 on monocytes, thus probably ruling out inflammasome-related mechanisms. Although it did impair the secretion of tumour necrosis factor alpha and interferon alpha. Our data provide strategies of blocking CR3 (CD11b) pathways could have implications for the treatment of viral infection by antiviral-related mechanisms.

TI  - Downregulation of Aedes aegypti chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7/Kismet by Wolbachia and its effect on dengue virus replication
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 6
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus imposing a significant burden on human health around the world. Since current control strategies are not sufficient, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control DENV transmission. It has been demonstrated that introduction of Wolbachia pipientis in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes can impede DENV transmission with the mechanism(s) not fully understood. Recently, a number of studies have found the involvement of chromodomain DNA binding helicases in case of Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Influenza A virus infection. In this study, we have identified three chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein (CHD) genes in Ae. aegypti and looked at their response in the case of Wolbachia and DENV infections. Foremost amongst them we have found that AeCHD7/Kismet is significantly downregulated in the presence of Wolbachia infection only in female mosquitoes. Furthermore, AeCHD7 levels showed significant increase during DENV infection, and AeCHD7 depletion led to severe reduction in the replication of DENV. Our data have identified AeCHD7 as a novel Ae. aegypti host factor that is important for DENV replication, and Wolbachia downregulates it, which may contribute towards the mechanism(s) of limiting DENV replication.

TI  - Drosha, DGCR8, and Dicer mRNAs are down-regulated in human cells infected with dengue virus 4, and play a role in viral pathogenesis.
JF  - Genetics and molecular research : GMR
VL  - 15 2
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) and its four serotypes (DENV1-4) belong to the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. DENV infection is a life-threatening disease, which results in up to 20,000 deaths each year. Viruses have been shown to encode trans-regulatory small RNAs, or microRNAs (miRNAs), which bind to messenger RNA and negatively regulate host or viral gene expression. During DENV infections, miRNAs interact with proteins in the RNAi pathway, and are processed by ribonucleases such as Dicer and Drosha. This study aims to investigate Drosha, DGCR8, and Dicer expression levels in human A-549 cells following DENV4 infection. DENV4 infected A-549 cells were collected daily for 5 days, and RNA was extracted to quantify viral load. Gene expression of Drosha, Dicer, and DGCR8 was determined using quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). We found that DENV4 infection exhibited the highest viral load 3 days post-infection. Dicer, Drosha, and DGCR8 showed reduced expression following DENV4 infection as compared with negative controls. In addition, we hypothesize that reduced expression of DGCR8 may not only be related to miRNA biogenesis, but also other small RNAs. This study may change our understanding regarding the relationship between host cells and the dengue virus.

TI  - Dual-Role Ubiquitination Regulation Shuttling the Entire Life Cycle of the Flaviviridae
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - Ubiquitination is a reversible protein post-translational modification that regulates various pivotal physiological and pathological processes in all eukaryotes. Recently, the antiviral immune response is enhanced by the regulation of ubiquitination. Intriguingly, Flaviviridae viruses can ingeniously hijack the ubiquitination system to help them survive, which has become a hot topic among worldwide researchers. The Flaviviridae family members, such as HCV and CSFV, can cause serious diseases of humans and animals around the world. The multiple roles of ubiquitination involved in the life cycle of Flaviviridae family would open new sight for future development of antiviral tactic. Here, we discuss recent advances with regard to functional roles of ubiquitination and some ubiquitin-like modifications in the life cycle of Flaviviridae infection, shedding new light on the antiviral mechanism research and therapeutic drug development.

TI  - Dynamic Interactions of Post Cleaved NS2B Cofactor and NS3 Protease Identified by Integrative Structural Approaches
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Diseases caused by flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile Virus (WNV), are a serious threat to public health. The flavivirus single-stranded RNA genome is translated into a polyprotein which is cleaved into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins by the viral and cellular proteases. Non-structural (NS) protein 3 is a multifunctional protein that has N-terminal protease and C-terminal helicase domains. The NS3 protease requires co-factor NS2B for enzymatic activity and folding. Due to its essential role in viral replication, NS2B-NS3 protease is an attractive target for antiviral drugs. Despite the availability of crystal structures, dynamic interactions of the N- and C-termini of NS2B co-factor have been elusive due to their flexible fold. In this study, we employ integrative structural approaches combined with biochemical assays to elucidate the dynamic interactions of the flexible DENV4 NS2B and NS3 N- and C-termini. We captured the crystal structure of self-cleaved DENV4 NS2B47NS3 protease in post cleavage state. The intermediate conformation adopted in the reported structure can be targeted by allosteric inhibitors. Comparison of our new findings from DENV4 against previously studied ZIKV NS2B-NS3 proteins reveals differences in NS2B-NS3 function between the two viruses. No inhibition of protease activity was observed for unlinked DENV NS2B-NS3 in presence of the cleavage site while ZIKV NS2B-NS3 cleavage inhibits protease activity. Another difference is that binding of the NS2B C-terminus to DENV4 eNS2B47NS3Pro active site is mediated via interactions with P4-P6 residues while for ZIKV, the binding of NS2B C-terminus to active site is mediated by P1-P3 residues. The mapping of NS2B N- and C-termini with NS3 indicates that these intermolecular interactions occur mainly on the beta-barrel 2 of the NS3 protease domain. Our integrative approach enables a comprehensive understanding of the folding and dynamic interactions of DENV NS3 protease and its cofactor NS2B.

TI  - Dynamic Nucleolar Targeting of Dengue Virus Polymerase NS5 in Response to Extracellular pH
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 5797
EP  - 5807
AB  - ABSTRACT The nucleolar subcompartment of the nucleus is increasingly recognized as an important target of RNA viruses. Here we document for the first time the ability of dengue virus (DENV) polymerase, nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), to accumulate within the nucleolus of infected cells and to target green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the nucleolus of live transfected cells. Intriguingly, NS5 exchange between the nucleus and nucleolus is dynamically modulated by extracellular pH, responding rapidly and reversibly to pH change, in contrast to GFP alone or other nucleolar and non-nucleolar targeted protein controls. The minimal pH-sensitive nucleolar targeting region (pHNTR), sufficient to target GFP to the nucleolus in a pH-sensitive fashion, was mapped to NS5 residues 1 to 244, with mutation of key hydrophobic residues, Leu-165, Leu-167, and Val-168, abolishing pHNTR function in NS5-transfected cells, and severely attenuating DENV growth in infected cells. This is the first report of a viral protein whose nucleolar targeting ability is rapidly modulated by extracellular stimuli, suggesting that DENV has the ability to detect and respond dynamically to the extracellular environment. IMPORTANCE Infections by dengue virus (DENV) threaten 40% of the world's population yet there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapeutic to treat infections. Understanding the molecular details that govern effective viral replication is key for the development of novel antiviral strategies. Here, we describe for the first time dynamic trafficking of DENV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) to the subnuclear compartment, the nucleolus. We demonstrate that NS5's targeting to the nucleolus occurs in response to acidic pH, identify the key amino acid residues within NS5 that are responsible, and demonstrate that their mutation severely impairs production of infectious DENV. Overall, this study identifies a unique subcellular trafficking event and suggests that DENV is able to detect and respond dynamically to environmental changes.

JF  - RNA Biology
VL  - 8
SP  - 249
EP  - 257
AB  - Dengue virus is an important human pathogen that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. The viral genome is a single molecule of RNA of positive polarity that plays multiple roles during the viral life cycle. Besides encoding the viral proteins, the genome contains RNA structures that regulate different viral processes. An important feature of dengue and other flavivirus genomes is the presence of inverted complementary sequences at the ends of the molecule that mediate long-range RNA-RNA interaction and genome cyclization. Recent studies have demonstrated that alternative conformations of the genome are necessary for infectivity. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the function of different RNA elements that modulate dengue virus replication and provide new ideas of how dynamic RNA structures participate in the viral processes.

TI  - Dynamic modulation of DC-SIGN and FcΥR2A receptors expression on platelets in dengue
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 13
AB  - Platelet activation has been reported to play a major role in inflammatory response and thrombocytopenia during dengue viral infection. Cells expressing FcϒR2Aand DC-SIGN receptors are reported to be involved in dengue virulence. The present study is designed to assess the expression level of these two receptors on platelet surface collected from dengue patients and to study its association in patients with platelet RNA positive for dengue virus. This was an analytical cross-sectional study carried out in JIPMER hospital, Puducherry. Forty-four patients with dengue infection as cases and 44 patients with non dengue acute other febrile illness(OFI) as controls were recruited. Peripheral venous blood was withdrawn on day of admission, day 3 post admission and day of discharge and serological tests for NS1 dengue antigen and anti IgM antibody were analyzed for diagnosis of dengue infection. Platelet rich plasma was assessed for DC SIGN, FcϒR2A levels and platelets separated from dengue patients were subjected to RNA extraction and detection of presence of viral RNA. The study observed a decreased expression of DC-SIGN and FcϒR2A on platelets in dengue patients compared to OFI group on all the time points. Further, cells expressing DC-SIGN and FcϒR2A were found to be decreased on platelets in dengue patients who were positive for NS1 antigen. DC-SIGN and FcϒR2A expression was also found to be notably decreased in patients positive for platelet DENV RNA when compared with patients negative for platelet DENV RNA. Our results suggest that DC-SIGN and FcϒR2A, which are receptors for viral capture and immune mediated clearance respectively, might be down regulated on platelets in patients with dengue infection. The decreased receptor expression diminishes platelet activation and subsequently has protective action on the host from the ongoing conflict between immune system and dengue virus.

TI  - Dysfunctional Innate Immune Responses and Severe Dengue
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Although infection with the dengue virus (DENV) causes severe dengue, it causes a mild self-limiting illness in the majority of individuals. There is emerging evidence that an aberrant immune response in the initial stages of infection lead to severe disease. Many inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators are significantly higher in patients with severe dengue compared to those who develop mild infection, during febrile phase of illness. Monocytes, mast cells, and many other cells of the immune system, when infected with the DENV, especially in the presence of poorly neutralizing antibodies, leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of interferon signaling pathways. In addition, production of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 further leads to inhibition of cellular antiviral responses. This dysregulated and aberrant immune response leads to reduced clearance of the virus, and severe dengue by inducing a vascular leak and excessive inflammation due to high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Individuals with comorbid illnesses could be prone to more severe dengue due to low grade endotoxemia, gut microbial dysbiosis and an altered phenotype of innate immune cells. The immunosuppressive and inflammatory lipid mediators and altered phenotype of monocytes are likely to further act on T cells and B cells leading to an impaired adaptive immune response to the virus. Therefore, in order to identify therapeutic targets for treatment of dengue, it would be important to further characterize these mechanisms in order for early intervention. In this review, we discuss the differences in the innate immune responses in those who progress to develop severe dengue, compared to those with milder disease in order to understand the mechanisms that lead to severe dengue.

TI  - E2 Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes Regulates Dengue Virus-2 Replication in Aedes albopictus
JF  - Microorganisms
VL  - 12
AB  - Aedes albopictus, a major vector of dengue virus (DENV), has a global distribution. Identifying the key components of the ubiquitin system of A. albopictus essential for the replication of viruses could help identify targets for developing broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. This study explores the interaction between E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Ubc9) and DENV-2 proteins (NS1, NS5, and E) using cell culture and mosquito models. The replication of DENV-2 and the knockdown efficiency of the Ubc9 gene were assessed through reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The DENV-2-related protein expression was evaluated via Western blot analysis. The interaction between Ubc9 and DENV E and NS5 proteins was investigated through confocal immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation. RNA interference technology was employed to silence Ubc9 expression in C6/36 cells and in A. albopictus mosquitoes. The expression level of Ubc9 in the DENV-2-infected group was 3.5-fold higher than that in the control group. The Ubc9 gene expression in the midgut tissue of the mosquito was significantly upregulated. Transfection of C6/36 and BHK-21 cells with the pAc5.1b-EGFP-Ubc9-HA vector led to the overexpression of Ubc9, which decreased the transcription levels of DENV E and NS1, NS5 proteins. The difference was statistically significant (F = 24.27, p < 0.01). The expression levels of DENV NS5 and E proteins significantly decreased after infection with DENV-2, suggesting that the depletion of Ubc9 may limit the replication of DENV-2. Ubc9 regulates DENV-2 replication through SUMOylation in the cells and A. albopictus, potentially affecting vector competence and DENV transmission. This is the first study to demonstrate that the Ubc9 of A. albopictus plays a significant role in regulating the replication of DENV in both mosquito cells and the mosquito itself. The study results may prove useful in designing appropriate therapeutic approaches for dengue and associated complications.

TI  - ER stress, autophagy, and RNA viruses
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 5
AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a general term for representing the pathway by which various stimuli affect ER functions. ER stress induces the evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways, called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which compromises the stimulus and then determines whether the cell survives or dies. In recent years, ongoing research has suggested that these pathways may be linked to the autophagic response, which plays a key role in the cell's response to various stressors. Autophagy performs a self-digestion function, and its activation protects cells against certain pathogens. However, the link between the UPR and autophagy may be more complicated. These two systems may act dependently, or the induction of one system may interfere with the other. Experimental studies have found that different viruses modulate these mechanisms to allow them to escape the host immune response or, worse, to exploit the host's defense to their advantage; thus, this topic is a critical area in antiviral research. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about how RNA viruses, including influenza virus, poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus 71, Japanese encephalitis virus, hepatitis C virus, and dengue virus, regulate these processes. We also discuss recent discoveries and how these will produce novel strategies for antiviral treatment.

TI  - ER-shaping Atlastin proteins act as central hubs to promote flavivirus replication and virion assembly
JF  - Nature microbiology
VL  - 4
SP  - 2416
EP  - 2429
AB  - Flaviviruses, including dengue virus and Zika virus, extensively remodel the cellular endomembrane network to generate replication organelles that promote viral genome replication and virus production. However, it remains unclear how these membranes and associated cellular proteins act during the virus cycle. Here, we show that atlastins (ATLs), a subset of ER resident proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases, have dichotomous effects on flaviviruses—with ATL2 depletion leading to replication organelle defects, and ATL3 depletion to changes in virus production pathways. We characterized non-conserved functional domains in ATL paralogues and show that the ATL interactome is profoundly reprogrammed following dengue virus infection. Screen analysis confirmed non-redundant ATL functions and identified a specific role for ATL3, and its interactor ARF4, in vesicle trafficking and virion maturation. Our data identify ATLs as central hubs targeted by flaviviruses to establish their replication organelle and to achieve efficient virion maturation and secretion. Flavivirus infection leads to a rearrangement of host cell ER membranes that creates an environment permissive to viral replication. The morphology of these membrane rearrangements is known, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here, atlastins—ER-resident membrane-bound GTPases of the dynamin family—are shown to be targeted by flaviviruses to establish their replication organelle and for virion maturation and secretion.

TI  - ERG-Associated lncRNA (ERGAL) Promotes the Stability and Integrity of Vascular Endothelial Barrier During Dengue Viral Infection via Interaction With miR-183-5p
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) continues to be a major public health problem. DENV infection will cause mild dengue and severe dengue. Severe dengue is clinically manifested as serious complications, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and/or dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), which is mainly characterized by vascular leakage. Currently, the pathogenesis of severe dengue is not elucidated thoroughly, and there are no known therapeutic targets for controlling the disease effectively. This study aimed to further reveal the potential molecular mechanism of severe dengue. In this study, the long non-coding RNA, ERG-associated lncRNA (lncRNA-ERGAL), was activated and significantly up-regulated in DENV-infected vascular endothelial cells. After knockdown of lncRNA-ERGAL, the expression of ERG, VE-cadherin, and claudin-5 was repressed; besides, cell apoptosis was enhanced, and cytoskeletal remodeling was disordered, leading to instability and increased permeability of vascular endothelial barrier during DENV infection. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay showed lncRNA-ERGAL to be mainly expressed in the cytoplasm. Moreover, the expression of miR-183-5p was found to increase during DENV infection and revealed to regulate ERG, junction-associated proteins, and the cytoskeletal structure after overexpression and knockdown. Then, ERGAL was confirmed to interact with miR-183-5p by luciferase reporter assay. Collectively, ERGAL acted as a miRNA sponge that can promote stability and integrity of vascular endothelial barrier during DENV infection via binding to miR-183-5p, thus revealing the potential molecular mechanism of severe dengue and providing a foundation for a promising clinical target in the future.

TI  - Early Dengue Virus Protein Synthesis Induces Extensive Rearrangement of the Endoplasmic Reticulum Independent of the UPR and SREBP-2 Pathway
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - The rearrangement of intracellular membranes has been long reported to be a common feature in diseased cells. In this study, we used dengue virus (DENV) to study the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and sterol-regulatory-element-binding-protein-2 (SREBP-2) pathway in the rearrangement and expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) early after infection. Using laser scanning confocal and differential interference contrast microscopy, we demonstrate that rearrangement and expansion of the ER occurs early after DENV-2 infection. Through the use of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells deficient in XBP1 and ATF6, we show that ER rearrangement early after DENV infection is independent of the UPR. We then demonstrate that enlargement of the ER is independent of the SREBP-2 activation and upregulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme-A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. We further show that this ER rearrangement is not inhibited by the treatment of DENV-infected cells with the cholesterol-inhibiting drug lovastatin. Using the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide, we show that de novo viral protein synthesis but not host transcription is necessary for expansion and rearrangement of the ER. Lastly, we demonstrate that viral infection induces the reabsorption of lipid droplets into the ER. Together, these results demonstrate that modulation of intracellular membrane architecture of the cell early after DENV-2 infection is driven by viral protein expression and does not require the induction of the UPR and SREBP-2 pathways. This work paves the way for further study of virally-induced membrane rearrangements and formation of cubic membranes.

TI  - Effect of C-type lectin 16 on dengue virus infection in Aedes aegypti salivary glands
JF  - PNAS Nexus
VL  - 3
AB  - Abstract C-type lectins (CTLs) are a family of carbohydrate-binding proteins and an important component of mosquito saliva. Although CTLs play key roles in immune activation and viral pathogenesis, little is known about their role in regulating dengue virus (DENV) infection and transmission. In this study, we established a homozygous CTL16 knockout Aedes aegypti mutant line using CRISPR/Cas9 to study the interaction between CTL16 and viruses in mosquito vectors. Furthermore, mouse experiments were conducted to confirm the transmission of DENV by CTL16−/− A. aegypti mutants. We found that CTL16 was mainly expressed in the medial lobe of the salivary glands (SGs) in female A. aegypti. CTL16 knockout increased DENV replication and accumulation in the SGs of female A. aegypti, suggesting that CTL16 plays an important role in DENV transmission. We also found a reduced expression of immunodeficiency and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway components correlated with increased DENV viral titer, infection rate, and transmission efficiency in the CTL16 mutant strain. The findings of this study provide insights not only for guiding future investigations on the influence of CTLs on immune responses in mosquitoes but also for developing novel mutants that can be used as vector control tools.

TI  - Effect of Larval Competition on Extrinsic Incubation Period and Vectorial Capacity of Aedes albopictus for Dengue Virus
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 10
AB  - Despite the growing awareness that larval competition can influence adult mosquito life history traits including susceptibility to pathogens, the net effect of larval competition on human risk of exposure to mosquito-borne pathogens remains poorly understood. We examined how intraspecific larval competition affects dengue-2 virus (DENV-2) extrinsic incubation period and vectorial capacity of its natural vector Aedes albopictus. Adult Ae. albopictus from low and high-larval density conditions were orally challenged with DENV-2 and then assayed for virus infection and dissemination rates following a 6, 9, or 12-day incubation period using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We then modeled the effect of larval competition on vectorial capacity using parameter estimates obtained from peer-reviewed field and laboratory studies. Larval competition resulted in significantly longer development times, lower emergence rates, and smaller adults, but did not significantly affect the extrinsic incubation period of DENV-2 in Ae. albopictus. Our vectorial capacity models suggest that the effect of larval competition on adult mosquito longevity likely has a greater influence on vectorial capacity relative to any competition-induced changes in vector competence. Furthermore, we found that large increases in the viral dissemination rate may be necessary to compensate for small competition-induced reductions in daily survivorship. Our results indicate that mosquito populations that experience stress from larval competition are likely to have a reduced vectorial capacity, even when susceptibility to pathogens is enhanced.

TI  - Effect of Larval Nutritional Regimes on Morphometry and Vectorial Capacity of Aedes aegypti for Dengue Transmission
JF  - BioMed Research International
VL  - 2019
AB  - Background Nutritional level in larval diet of mosquito vectors influence on life history traits and vectorial capacity (VC). Therefore, the present study was carried out to assess the effect of larval diet concentration on vector bionomic and VC of Aedes aegypti in Sri Lanka. Method Three batches of 400 Ae. aegypti larvae (first instar) were reared under different concentrations of larval diet (6%, 8%, and 10%; Volume/Volume), which was prepared by mixing 12.5 g of tuna meal, 9.0 g of bovine liver powder, and 3.5 g of Brewer's yeast, in 100 ml of distilled water. The effect of larval diet concentration on different morphometric and functional parameters of larvae (length and width of head, abdomen, survival rate, and pupation success), pupae (length and width of cephalothorax, survival rate, and adult emersion), adult (length and width of thorax, abdomen, survival rate, longevity, biting frequency and fecundity of adults) were examined. In addition, VC of Ae. aegypti was evaluated. The General Linear Model (GLM) was used for the statistical analysis. Results Larval head length, head width, thoracic width, abdominal length, abdominal width, total length, and survival rate significantly increased with higher doses of larval diet (P < 0.05). In case of pupae, length, and width of cephalothorax, survival rate and adult emergence rate denoted an increasing trend with the elevated larval diets. However, the variations of survival rate and adult emergence rate were statistically significant (P < 0.05). In adults, all morphometric parameters (thoracic length, abdominal length, abdominal width, and wing length) significantly increased with elevating larval diets levels (except for thoracic width) along with the biting frequency, fecundity, and survival rate (P < 0.05) of adult females. The VC also denoted significant variations (F4,14 = 24.048; P < 0.05) with the larval diet concentration, whereby the highest VC of 196.37 was observed at 10% treatment. Conclusion Larval food availability has a significant influence on the adult fitness and thus may affect the incidence of dengue due to variations in the VC of Ae.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted to humans by Aedes sp. mosquitoes. Little is known about the cellular and molecular interactions between the virus and the mosquito. The identification of resistance mechanisms could provide insight for the development of control strategies based on genetic manipulation. Objective: To determine the effect of nitric oxide (NO) donors/inhibitors on DENV replication in Aedes aegypti and Anopheles albimanus. Materials and Methods:Ae. aegypti and An. albimanus were fed with a blood suspension supplemented with DENV and donors/inhibitors of NO; DENV replication was assessed by immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and qRT-PCR parallel to NO measurement by means of the Griess reaction. Results: DENV replicates at 3×106 genome copies/day/mosquito in Aedes. In comparison, no evidence of virus genome accumulation was detected when 2 mM sodium nitroprusside, a NO donor, were added to the infected blood meal. DENV did not replicate in Anopheles unless 1 mML-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester, a NO synthesis inhibitor, was added to the infected blood meal, although the absolute viral load was significantly lower than in Aedes. Conclusions: As in humans, NO participates in the control of the virus load in mosquitoes. However, other mechanisms could also be involved in virus resistance in Anopheles.

TI  - Effect of Passage History on Dengue-2 Virus Replication in Subpopulations of Human Leukocytes

VL  - 26
SP  - 534
EP  - 541
AB  - Three passage levels of dengue-2 virus strain PR-159, obtained during the course of deriving the attenuated S-1 vaccine, were tested for their ability to replicate in subpopulations of human peripheral blood leukocytes: (i) 6th primary African green monkey kidney (PGMK) cell passage (parent virus); (ii) 19th PGMK cell passage of a small-plaque-forming clone derived from the parent virus (S-1 PGMK virus); and (iii) virus derived by four additional passages of the S-1 PGMK virus in diploid fetal rhesus lung cells (S-1 vaccine virus). Replication of these PR-159 viruses and another strain of dengue-2 virus adapted to Raji cells (16681-Raji virus) was measured in adherent and nonadherent mononuclear cells. All viruses except the S-1 PGMK virus replicated in monocytes. Occasional replication of the S-1 PGMK virus was associated with reversion to parent virus. The addition to the monocyte cultures of low concentrations of homologous dengue-2 antibody or non-neutralizing heterologous antibody increased the yield of the parent virus as much as 400-fold. This phenomenon of immune enhancement usually enabled the S-1 PGMK virus to replicate slowly in monocytes, but the progeny virus produced large plaques similar to the parent virus. Replication of the S-1 vaccine virus in cultured monocytes did not result in the appearance of large plaques. We could not recover S-1 vaccine virus from monocytes harvested from infected volunteers in the same manner that monocytes from natural human infections yield wild virus. The three passage levels of PR-159 virus were tested for replication in lymphocytes in comparison with the 16681-Raji virus. Only the 16681-Raji virus replicated in human lymphocytes cultured with or without enhancing antibody.

AB  - Some of the fibrinolytic and coagulation enzymes that monocytes produce are urokinase, a plasminogen activator (PA); a PA-specific inhibitor (PAI); and procoagulant activity (PCA), which has been characterized as tissue factor. Dengue infection in vivo is restricted to monocytes; however, it is unknown if dengue-infected monocytes undergo alterations in the production of PA, PAI, and PCA. This issue was addressed in studies in which monocytes were infected in vitro with dengue 2 virus in serum-free medium in the presence of enhancing antibody. No urokinase activity was detected in either control or infected cells or in their supernatants. Infection of monocytes with dengue 2 virus resulted in an almost threefold increase in PAI activity in cells and supernatants. No change in relation to the control was observed in PCA generated by the infected cells. These data indicate that dengue 2 infection enhances the production of PAI from monocytes without altering PA or PCA.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most important mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that is transmitted throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The primary mosquito vector of DENV in urban locations is Aedes aegypti. Key to understanding the transmission of DENV is the relationship between pathogen and vector. Accordingly, we report our preliminary characterization of the differentially expressed proteins from Ae. aegypti mosquitoes after DENV infection. We investigated the virus-vector interaction through changes in the proteome of the salivary glands of mosquitoes with disseminated DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) infections using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identification by mass spectrometry. Our findings indicate that DENV-2 infection in the Ae. aegypti salivary gland alters the expression of structural, secreted, and metabolic proteins. These changes in the salivary gland proteome highlight the virally influenced environment caused by a DENV-2 infection and warrant additional investigation to determine if these differences extend to the expectorated saliva.

AB  - Mice injected with dengue virus showed a depressed primary and secondary humoral immune response to SRBC as measured by the number of antibody-forming cells, haemagglutinin and haemolysin titres. The time of administration of SRBC during the infection was found to be an important factor determining the response to SRBC. The cell-mediated immune response was also suppressed as measured by the delayed hypersensitivity reaction to SRBC in the footpad. While the immunosuppression of humoral immunity was only transient and the animals recovered within 30 days following infection, the cell-mediated immunity remained suppressed throughout this period. Immunofluorescent studies and LD50 determination of the infected brains demonstrated significant virus titres from 7 to 15 days postinfection. This period coincided with maximal immunosuppression.

AB  - Dengue virus-infected mice showed a depressed antibody response to polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) when compared to controls. In both control and dengue virus-infected animals which were treated with anti-thymocyte serum (ATS) and primed with PVP, there was a heightened antibody response to PVP, suggesting that the anti-PVP response was controlled by T suppressor cells. The increase in the anti-PVP response in dengue virus-infected, ATS-treated animals was found to be similar to that seen in ATS-treated controls. T cells from infected animals could transfer suppression of anti-PVP response to normal mice, whereas the T cells from control animals could not induce significant suppression. The T cells from dengue virus-infected animals which had received 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) tolerogen could induce in normal mice a significantly higher percentage of tolerance to contact sensitivity to DNFB when compared to the control T cells. The adherent and B cells from both infected and control animals failed to induce significant tolerance. These findings suggested that during dengue virus infection, there is enhanced T suppressor cell activity regulating the B cell response to PVP and T cell response to DNFB.

JF  - Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica
VL  - 47 12
SP  - 960
EP  - 8
AB  - The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cascade of events that helps restoring cellular homeostasis under stressful conditions. It is activated when there is an imbalance in the protein load and protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a result of an increase in the naïve, unfolded, or misfolded protein content of the cell. Dengue virus (DENV) utilizes the host machinery to synthesize viral proteins and replicates in the cell. During DENV infection, up-regulation of viral proteins increases the protein pool of the cell, resulting in the induction of UPR pathway. In this study, we have tried to understand the consequence of UPR induction during DENV infection in human monocytic cells. To fulfill this objective, we have used VER-155008 (VER), a known inhibitor of the 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), which is the master regulator of the UPR pathway. After VER treatment, cells were infected with DENV, and the induction of the UPR elements and their downstream activation was studied by western blotting and RT-PCR analysis. Interestingly, inhibition of GRP78 via VER treatment led to the decreased expression of DENV envelope protein through the activation of the UPR elements, protein kinase-like ER resident kinase, activating transcription factor 6, and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and then led to the activation of innate immune factors such as double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), interferon regulated factor 3 (IRF3), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β). This strategy may be used to decrease viral infection transiently. Thus UPR elements could be important therapeutic targets for decreasing DENV multiplication.

EP  - 7
AB  - The effect of mosquito midgut trypsins in dengue serotype 2 flavivirus (DENV-2) infectivity to Aedes aegypti was studied. Addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) in a DENV-2 infectious blood meal resulted in a 91-97% decrease in midgut DENV-2 RNA copies (qRT-PCR analysis). STI treatment also resulted in slower DENV-2 replication in the midgut, less DENV-2 E protein expression, and decreased dissemination to the thorax and the head. A second uninfected blood meal, 7 days after the STI-treated infectious meal, significantly increased DENV-2 replication in the midgut and recovered oogenesis, suggesting that the lower viral infection caused by STI was in part due to a nutritional effect. Mosquitoes fed DENV-2 digested in vitro with bovine trypsin (before STI addition) exhibited a transient increase in midgut DENV-2 4 days postinfection. Blood digestion and possibly DENV-2 proteolytic processing, mediated by midgut trypsins, influence the rate of DENV-2 infection, replication, and dissemination in Ae. aegypti.

TI  - Effects of Arboviral Infections on Transposable Element Transcript Levels in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Genome Biology and Evolution
VL  - 16
AB  - Abstract Transposable elements are mobile repeated sequences found in all genomes. Transposable elements are controlled by RNA interference pathways in most organisms, and this control involves the PIWI-interacting RNA pathway and the small interfering RNA pathway, which is also known to be the first line of antiviral defense in invertebrates. Using Drosophila, we recently showed that viral infections result in the modulation of transposable element transcript levels through modulation of the small RNA repertoire. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is of particular interest because almost half of its genome is made of transposable elements, and it is described as a major vector of viruses (such as the dengue [DENV], Zika [ZIKV], and chikungunya [CHIKV] arboviruses). Moreover, Aedes mosquitoes are unique among insects in that the PIWI-interacting RNA pathway is also involved in the somatic antiviral response, in addition to the transposable element control and PIWI-interacting RNA pathway genes expanded in the mosquito genome. For these reasons, we studied the impacts of viral infections on transposable element transcript levels in A. aegypti samples. We retrieved public datasets corresponding to RNA-seq data obtained from viral infections by DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV in various tissues. We found that transposable element transcripts are moderately modulated following viral infection and that the direction of the modulation varies greatly across tissues and viruses. These results highlight the need for an in-depth investigation of the tightly intertwined interactions between transposable elements and viruses.

TI  - Effects of Ca++ Ion on the Liberation of Dengue Virus from BHK‐21 Cells in Culture *
JF  - Microbiology and Immunology
VL  - 22
AB  - The mechanism by which virus is liberated from infected cells is important for studying the process of virus infection. At least three possible ways of virus liberation are (i) reverse phagocytosis (exocytosis), (ii) disruption of cells (bursting) and (iii) budding from the cellular membrane. As for dengue viruses, there have been a few reports suggesting the exocytotic discharge of virus based on electron microscopic observations (1, 2, 5). It has already been reported that a high Mg++ concentration in a media of dengue-infected Vero cells enhances virus liberation from the cells (7). The mechanism underlying this phenomenon may probably be stimulation of the liberation of mature virus from the intracytoplasm to the extracytoplasmic space under the influence of the high Mg++ concentration in media (8). These facts prompted us to study the Ca++ dependency of dengue virus liberation from infected cells, which suggested that this phenomenon was due to an exocytotic process. A concept has been presented that exocytosis is the mechanism for the release of secretory substances from neuron, neurosecretory, endocrine, and mast cells and that Ca++ ion is essential for the release of secretions by this exocytotic process (10). If the virus liberation from cells is due to exocytosis, it might be possible that Ca++ ion dependency exists. We examined this possibility in the present work. Type 1 dengue virus (Mochizuki strain) (DEN) and, as a control, chikungunya virus (African strain) (CHIK) were used. It has been known that chikungunya virus is liberated from the cell surface membrane by the process of budding instead of exocytosis (4,6). We studied whether or not maintenance of cells in a Ca-free culture medium containing EDTA, a chelating agent, affected DEN liberation.

TI  - Effects of Larval Nutrition on Wolbachia-Based Dengue Virus Interference in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)
JF  - Journal of Medical Entomology
VL  - 53
SP  - 894
EP  - 901
AB  - Abstract In order to assess the broad-scale applicability of field releases of Wolbachia for the biological control of insecttransmitted diseases, we determined the relationship between the larval diet of Aedes aegypti L. mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia strains and their susceptibility to dengue virus (DENV) infection via intrathoracic injection and oral inoculation. Larvae were reared on diets that varied in the quantity of food which had the effect of modifying development time and adult body size. Wolbachia wMel infection was associated with highly significant reductions in dengue serotype 2 (DENV-2) infection rates of between 80 and 97.5% following intrathoracic injection of adults emerging from three diet levels. Reductions were 100% in two diet level treatments following oral inoculation. Similarly, wMelPop infection was associated with highly significant reductions in DENV-2 infection rates of between 95 and 100% for intrathoracic injection and 97.5 and 100% for oral inoculation across diet level treatments. Larval diet level had no significant effect on DENV-2 infection rates in the presence of Wolbachia infection in mosquitoes that were intrathoracically injected with the virus. This indicates that the effectiveness of Wolbachia on vector competence disruption within Ae. aegypti is unlikely to be compromised by variable larval nutrition in field settings.

TI  - Effects of blood and virus‐infected blood on protein expression in the midgut of the dengue vector Aedes albopictus
JF  - Medical and Veterinary Entomology
VL  - 21
AB  - Abstract Although the mosquito midgut is the primary site of bloodmeal storage and the first line of defence against pathogenic infection, little is known about its proteic composition at a time when an increasing number of proteins are reported to impair viral infection. Aedes albopictus Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae) is an important vector of the dengue virus. We compared 2‐dimensional protein profiles of the adult midgut in this species, taking into account bloodmeal status. The comparison of profiles from sugar‐fed and blood‐fed females showed that a considerable number of proteins were present in both midguts. In addition, one set of proteins was present only after sugar intake and another set only after blood intake. The comparison of profiles of blood‐fed midguts and dengue virus‐2 infected blood‐fed midguts revealed that at least six proteins were present only in the infected midguts. These results are discussed in the context of the identification of midgut proteins involved in the dengue virus infection process.

TI  - Efficient Assembly and Secretion of Recombinant Subviral Particles of the Four Dengue Serotypes Using Native prM and E Proteins
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 4
AB  - Background Flavivirus infected cells produce infectious virions and subviral particles, both of which are formed by the assembly of prM and E envelope proteins and are believed to undergo the same maturation process. Dengue recombinant subviral particles have been produced in cell cultures with either modified or chimeric proteins but not using the native forms of prM and E. Methodology/Principal Findings We have used a codon optimization strategy to obtain an efficient expression of native viral proteins and production of recombinant subviral particles (RSPs) for all four dengue virus (DV) serotypes. A stable HeLa cell line expressing DV1 prME was established (HeLa-prME) and RSPs were analyzed by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. We found that E protein is mainly present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where assembly of RSPs could be observed. Biochemical characterization of DV1 RSPs secretion revealed both prM protein cleavage and homodimerization of E proteins before their release into the supernatant, indicating that RSPs undergo a similar maturation process as dengue virus. Pulse chase experiment showed that 8 hours are required for the secretion of DV1 RSPs. We have used HeLa-prME to develop a semi-quantitative assay and screened a human siRNA library targeting genes involved in membrane trafficking. Knockdown of 23 genes resulted in a significant reduction in DV RSP secretion, whereas for 22 others we observed an increase of RSP levels in cell supernatant. Conclusions/Significance Our data describe the efficient production of RSPs containing native prM and E envelope proteins for all dengue serotypes. Dengue RSPs and corresponding producing cell lines are safe and novel tools that can be used in the study of viral egress as well as in the development of vaccine and drugs against dengue virus.

TI  - Electrostatic Interaction Between NS1 and Negatively Charged Lipids Contributes to Flavivirus Replication Organelles Formation
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Flavivirus replication occurs in membranous replication compartments, also known as replication organelles (ROs) derived from the host ER membrane. Our previous study showed that the non-structural (NS) protein 1 (NS1) is the essential factor for RO creation by hydrophobic insertion into the ER membrane. Here, we found that the association of NS1 with the membrane can be facilitated by the electrostatic interaction between NS1 and negatively charged lipids. NS1 binds to a series of negatively charged lipids, including PI4P, and a positively charged residue, R31, located on the membrane-binding face of NS1, plays important roles in this interaction. The NS1 R31E mutation significantly impairs NS1 association with negatively charged membrane and its ER remodeling ability in the cells. To interfere with the electrostatic interaction between NS1 and negatively charged lipids, intracellular phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) level was downregulated by the overexpression of Sac1 or treatment with PI3K and PI4K inhibitors to attenuate flavivirus replication. Our findings emphasize the importance of electrostatic interaction between NS1 and negatively charged lipids in flavivirus RO formation.

EP  - 25
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) cause significantly more human disease than any other arbovirus, with hundreds of thousands of cases leading to severe disease in thousands annually. Antibodies and T cells induced by primary infection with DENV have the potential for both positive (protective) and negative (pathological) effects during subsequent DENV infections. In this review, we summarize studies that have examined T-cell responses in humans following natural infection and vaccination. We discuss studies that support a role for T cells in protection against and those that support a role for the involvement of T cells in the pathogenesis of severe disease. The mechanisms that lead to severe disease are complex, and T-cell responses are an important component that needs to be further evaluated for the development of safe and efficacious DENV vaccines.

TI  - Emerging Roles of Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans in Viral Pathogenesis
JF  - Seminars in Thrombosis and Hemostasis
VL  - 47
SP  - 283
EP  - 294
AB  - Abstract Heparan sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan present in nearly all mammalian tissues. Heparan sulfate moieties are attached to the cell surface via heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) which are composed of a protein core bound to multiple heparan sulfate chains. HSPGs contribute to the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix and participate in cell signaling by releasing bound cytokines and chemokines once cleaved by an enzyme, heparanase. HSPGs are often exploited by viruses during infection, particularly during attachment and egress. Loss or inhibition of HSPGs initially during infection can yield significant decreases in viral entry and infectivity. In this review, we provide an overview of HSPGs in the lifecycle of multiple viruses, including herpesviruses, human immunodeficiency virus, dengue virus, human papillomavirus, and coronaviruses.

TI  - Emerging Theme: Cellular PDZ Proteins as Common Targets of Pathogenic Viruses
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 11544
EP  - 11556
AB  - ABSTRACT More than a decade ago, three viral oncoproteins, adenovirus type 9 E4-ORF1, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax, and high-risk human papillomavirus E6, were found to encode a related carboxyl-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) that mediates interactions with a select group of cellular PDZ proteins. Recent studies have shown that many other viruses also encode PBM-containing proteins that bind to cellular PDZ proteins. Interestingly, these recently recognized viruses include not only some with oncogenic potential (hepatitis B virus, rhesus papillomavirus, cottontail rabbit papillomavirus) but also many without this potential (influenza virus, Dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, rabies virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus). Examination of the cellular PDZ proteins that are targets of viral PBMs reveals that the viral proteins often interact with the same or similar types of PDZ proteins, most notably Dlg1 and other members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family, as well as Scribble. In addition, cellular PDZ protein targets of viral PBMs commonly control tight junction formation, cell polarity establishment, and apoptosis. These findings reveal a new theme in virology wherein many different virus families encode proteins that bind and perturb the function of cellular PDZ proteins. The inhibition or perturbation of the function of cellular PDZ proteins appears to be a widely used strategy for viruses to enhance their replication, disseminate in the host, and transmit to new hosts.

TI  - Emerging role of lipid droplets in Aedes aegypti immune response against bacteria and Dengue virus
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 6
AB  - In mammals, lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous organelles that modulate immune and inflammatory responses through the production of lipid mediators. In insects, it is unknown whether LDs play any role during the development of immune responses. We show that Aedes aegypti Aag2 cells – an immune responsive cell lineage – accumulates LDs when challenged with Enterobacter cloacae, Sindbis and Dengue viruses. Microarray analysis of Aag2 challenged with E.cloacae or infected with Dengue virus revealed high transcripts levels of genes associated with lipid storage and LDs biogenesis, correlating with the increased LDs numbers in those conditions. Similarly, in mosquitoes, LDs accumulate in midgut cells in response to Serratia marcescens and Sindbis virus or when the native microbiota proliferates, following a blood meal. Also, constitutive activation of Toll and IMD pathways by knocking-down their respective negative modulators (Cactus and Caspar) increases LDs numbers in the midgut. Our results show for the first time an infection-induced LDs accumulation in response to both bacterial and viral infections in Ae. Aegypti, and we propose a role for LDs in mosquito immunity. These findings open new venues for further studies in insect immune responses associated with lipid metabolism.

AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) are neutral lipid storage organelles ubiquitous to eukaryotic cells. It is increasingly recognized that LDs interact extensively with other organelles and that they perform functions beyond passive lipid storage and lipid homeostasis. One emerging function for LDs is the coordination of immune responses, as these organelles participate in the generation of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are important inflammation mediators. Similarly, LDs are also beginning to be recognized as playing a role in interferon responses and in antigen cross presentation. Not surprisingly, there is emerging evidence that many pathogens, including hepatitis C and Dengue viruses, Chlamydia, and Mycobacterium, target LDs during infection either for nutritional purposes or as part of an anti-immunity strategy. We here review recent findings that link LDs to the regulation and execution of immune responses in the context of host-pathogen interactions.

TI  - Endocytosis of flavivirus NS1 is required for NS1-mediated endothelial hyperpermeability and is abolished by a single N-glycosylation site mutation
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 15
AB  - Arthropod-borne flaviviruses cause life-threatening diseases associated with endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leak. We recently found that vascular leak can be triggered by dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) via the disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer (EGL). However, the molecular determinants of NS1 required to trigger EGL disruption and the cellular pathway(s) involved remain unknown. Here we report that mutation of a single glycosylated residue of NS1 (N207Q) abolishes the ability of NS1 to trigger EGL disruption and induce endothelial hyperpermeability. Intriguingly, while this mutant bound to the surface of endothelial cells comparably to wild-type NS1, it was no longer internalized, suggesting that NS1 binding and internalization are distinct steps. Using endocytic pathway inhibitors and gene-specific siRNAs, we determined that NS1 was endocytosed into endothelial cells in a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent manner, which was required to trigger endothelial dysfunction in vitro and vascular leak in vivo. Finally, we found that the N207 glycosylation site is highly conserved among flaviviruses and is also essential for West Nile and Zika virus NS1 to trigger endothelial hyperpermeability via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These data provide critical mechanistic insight into flavivirus NS1-induced pathogenesis, presenting novel therapeutic and vaccine targets for flaviviral diseases.

TI  - Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein SCAP Inhibits Dengue Virus NS2B3 Protease by Suppressing Its K27-Linked Polyubiquitylation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue viruses (DENVs) are an emerging threat to global public health. The NS2B3 protease complex of DENV has recently been shown to cleave the antiviral protein STING and thereby subvert the innate immune signaling to facilitate virus replication. Whether host cells have a mechanism to counteract this virus-mediated immunosuppression is unclear. We discovered that the K27-linked polyubiquitination of NS3 protein facilitates its recruitment of NS2B, the formation of NS2B3, and consequently the enhanced cleavage of STING. However, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein, SCAP, through binding to NS2B protein, inhibits the ubiquitination of NS3, rendering NS2B3 protease incapable of binding and cleaving STING. Importantly, ectopic expression of SCAP impaired DENV infection, whereas silencing of SCAP potentiated DENV infection. Collectively, this study uncovered a novel function of SCAP of counteracting the inhibitory action of DENV NS2B3 protease on STING signaling, suggesting that modulation of SCAP levels may have therapeutic implications. IMPORTANCE This study reports the first ubiquitylation target protein in DENV, the NS3 protein, and the unique role of K27-linked polyubiquitylation in NS3's ability to recruit NS2B and formation of the NS2B3 protease complex. Additionally, this study identified novel functions of the ER protein SCAP: one is to compete with NS2B for binding to STING, and the other is to inhibit the ubiquitination of NS3. Both of these functions protect STING from being cleaved by the NS2B3 protease and thus contribute to host antiviral response.

TI  - Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation Controls Virus Protein Homeostasis, Which Is Required for Flavivirus Propagation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - The results of this study reveal the cellular ERAD system controls the amount of each viral protein in virus-infected cells and that this “viral protein homeostasis” is critical for viral propagation. Furthermore, we clarified that the “convoluted membrane (CM),” which was previously considered a structure with unknown function, serves as a kind of waste dump where viral protein degradation occurs. ABSTRACT Many positive-stranded RNA viruses encode polyproteins from which viral proteins are generated by processing the polyproteins. This system produces an equal amount of each viral protein, though the required amounts for each protein are not the same. In this study, we found the extra membrane-anchored nonstructural (NS) proteins of Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue virus are rapidly and selectively degraded by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Our gene targeting study revealed that ERAD involving Derlin2 and SEL1L, but not Derlin1, is required for the viral genome replication. Derlin2 is predominantly localized in the convoluted membrane (CM) of the viral replication organelle, and viral NS proteins are degraded in the CM. Hence, these results suggest that viral protein homeostasis is regulated by Derlin2-mediated ERAD in the CM, and this process is critical for the propagation of these viruses. IMPORTANCE The results of this study reveal the cellular ERAD system controls the amount of each viral protein in virus-infected cells and that this “viral protein homeostasis” is critical for viral propagation. Furthermore, we clarified that the “convoluted membrane (CM),” which was previously considered a structure with unknown function, serves as a kind of waste dump where viral protein degradation occurs. We also found that the Derlin2/SEL1L/HRD1-specific pathway is involved in this process, whereas the Derlin1-mediated pathway is not. This novel ERAD-mediated fine-tuning system for the stoichiometries of polyprotein-derived viral proteins may represent a common feature among polyprotein-encoding viruses.

TI  - Endothelial Cells Elicit Immune-Enhancing Responses to Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 6408
EP  - 6415
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue viruses cause two severe diseases that alter vascular fluid barrier functions, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Preexisting antibodies to dengue virus disposes patients to immune-enhanced edema (DSS) or hemorrhagic (DHF) disease following infection by a discrete dengue virus serotype. Although the endothelium is the primary vascular fluid barrier, direct effects of dengue virus on endothelial cells (ECs) have not been considered primary factors in pathogenesis. Here, we show that dengue virus infection of human ECs elicits immune-enhancing EC responses. Our results suggest that rapid early dengue virus proliferation within ECs is permitted by dengue virus regulation of early, but not late, beta interferon (IFN-β) responses. The analysis of EC responses following synchronous dengue virus infection revealed the high-level induction and secretion of immune cells (T cells, B cells, and mast cells) as well as activating and recruiting cytokines BAFF (119-fold), IL-6/8 (4- to 7-fold), CXCL9/10/11 (45- to 338-fold), RANTES (724-fold), and interleukin-7 (IL-7; 128-fold). Moreover, we found that properdin factor B, an alternative pathway complement activator that directs chemotactic anaphylatoxin C3a and C5a production, was induced 34-fold. Thus, dengue virus-infected ECs evoke key inflammatory responses observed in dengue virus patients which are linked to DHF and DSS. Our findings suggest that dengue virus-infected ECs directly contribute to immune enhancement, capillary permeability, viremia, and immune targeting of the endothelium. These data implicate EC responses in dengue virus pathogenesis and further rationalize therapeutic targeting of the endothelium as a means of reducing the severity of dengue virus disease.

TI  - Endothelial Dysfunction, HMGB1, and Dengue: An Enigma to Solve
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Dengue is a viral infection caused by dengue virus (DENV), which has a significant impact on public health worldwide. Although most infections are asymptomatic, a series of severe clinical manifestations such as hemorrhage and plasma leakage can occur during the severe presentation of the disease. This suggests that the virus or host immune response may affect the protective function of endothelial barriers, ultimately being considered the most relevant event in severe and fatal dengue pathogenesis. The mechanisms that induce these alterations are diverse. It has been suggested that the high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) may be involved in endothelial dysfunction. This non-histone nuclear protein has different immunomodulatory activities and belongs to the alarmin group. High concentrations of HMGB1 have been detected in patients with several infectious diseases, including dengue, and it could be considered as a biomarker for the early diagnosis of dengue and a predictor of complications of the disease. This review summarizes the main features of dengue infection and describes the known causes associated with endothelial dysfunction, highlighting the involvement and possible relationship between HMGB1 and DENV.

TI  - Endothelial cell surface expression of protein disulfide isomerase activates β1 and β3 integrins and facilitates dengue virus infection
JF  - Journal of Cellular Biochemistry
VL  - 113
AB  - Infection with dengue virus (DENV) causes diseases ranging from mild dengue fever to severe hemorrhage or shock syndrome. DENV infection of endothelial cells may cause cell apoptosis or vascular leakage and result in clinical illness of hemorrhage. However, the endothelial cell molecules involved in DENV infection and the mechanisms governing virus–cell interactions are still uncertain. Since protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) reducing function at the cell surface was shown to be required for entry of certain viruses and bacteria, we explored the role of PDI expressed on endothelial cell surface in DENV infection. Using siRNA to knock down PDI, DENV infection was reduced which could be reversed by treating cells with a reducing agent Tris(2‐carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP). DENV‐induced PDI surface expression was mediated through the Lys‐Asp‐Glu‐Leu (KDEL) receptor‐Src family kinase signal pathway. Furthermore, cell surface PDI colocalized with β1 and β3 integrins after DENV infection, and the activation of integrins was blocked by PDI inhibition. Finally, blockade of PDI inhibited DENV entry into endothelial cells. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism whereby surface PDI which causes integrin activation is involved in DENV entry, and DENV infection further increases PDI surface expression at later time points. These findings may have implications for anti‐DENV drug design. J. Cell. Biochem. 113: 1681–1691, 2012. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a leading cause of illness and death, mainly in the (sub)tropics, where it causes dengue fever and/or the more serious diseases dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome that are associated with changes in vascular permeability. Despite extensive research, the pathogenesis of DENV is still poorly understood and, although endothelial cells represent the primary fluid barrier of the blood vessels, the extent to which these cells contribute to DENV pathology is still under debate. The primary target cells for DENV are dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages that release various chemokines and cytokines upon infection, which can activate the endothelium and are thought to play a major role in DENV‐induced vascular permeability. However, recent studies indicate that DENV also replicates in endothelial cells and that DENV‐infected endothelial cells may directly contribute to viremia, immune activation, vascular permeability and immune targeting of the endothelium. Also, the viral non‐structural protein‐1 and antibodies directed against this secreted protein have been reported to be involved in endothelial cell dysfunction. This review provides an extensive overview of the effects of DENV infection on endothelial cell physiology and barrier function. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Enhanced humoral and HLA‐A2‐restricted dengue virus‐specific T‐cell responses in humanized BLT NSG mice
JF  - Immunology
VL  - 136
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito‐borne viral disease of humans, and animal models that recapitulate human immune responses or dengue pathogenesis are needed to understand the pathogenesis of the disease. We recently described an animal model for dengue virus (DENV) infection using humanized NOD‐scid IL2rγnull mice (NSG) engrafted with cord blood haematopoietic stem cells. We sought to further improve this model by co‐transplantation of human fetal thymus and liver tissues into NSG (BLT‐NSG) mice. Enhanced DENV‐specific antibody titres were found in the sera of BLT‐NSG mice compared with human cord blood haematopoietic stem cell‐engrafted NSG mice. Furthermore, B cells generated during the acute phase and in memory from splenocytes of immunized BLT‐NSG mice secreted DENV‐specific IgM antibodies with neutralizing activity. Human T cells in engrafted BLT‐NSG mice secreted interferon‐γ in response to overlapping DENV peptide pools and HLA‐A2 restricted peptides. The BLT‐NSG mice will allow assessment of human immune responses to DENV vaccines and the effects of previous immunity on subsequent DENV infections.

In their paper entitled “ Variation in Wolbachia effects on Aedes mosquitoes as a determinant of invasiveness and vectorial capacity ” , King et al. 3 used DENV infection and transmission modelling to reinterpret experimental data from two previous studies 4,5 .

AB  - Enhanced dengue 2 virus (D2V) infection in suspension cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear phagocytes (PBL) produced by subneutralizing concentrations of dengue antisera has been described previously. In this study, the enhancement phenomenon was found to be a general property of representative flavivirus antisera. All except one of 24 antisera, which had been raised by 1-3 injections of flaviviruses in rabbits, enhanced the growth of dengue 2 virus in human PBL. Flavivirus antisera showing the greatest level of cross-reactivity against a battery of 42 flavivirus antigens in the hemagglutination-inhibition test were most potent in enhancing dengue replication in PBL cultures. Cross-neutralizing reactivity did not relate to enhanced D2V infection. However nearly one-half of studied flavivirus antisera neutralized D2V at dilutions of 1:10 or 1:20. Heterotypic D2V neutralizing antibody could serve as a "brake" on infection enhancement in vivo. Observations should be made in the field to look for possible enhancement of dengue infection in heterotypic flavivirus immunes.

JF  - Journal of Vaccines and Vaccination
VL  - 4
SP  - 1
EP  - 7
AB  - Several attempts to develop dengue recombinant subunit vaccines have failed due to insufficient levels of expression and incorrect folding of the E protein. In order to verify the importance of the precursor membrane protein to the level of E protein expression, we constructed two recombinant plasmids by cloning the full-length sequence of the prM gene from the dengue-2 and dengue-3 virus strains into a plasmid that expresses a truncated version of the E protein of the dengue-2 virus. Next, we evaluated these two constructs for their effect on the levels of E protein expression in vitro. Our results showed that both plasmids provided a correct expression of the E protein as E protein expression was detected in transfected Vero cells as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. Densitometry analysis of western blots of the cell extracts showed a 67.02% higher expression of E protein in the cells transfected with pCID2EtD3prM, indicating that the prM sequence of the dengue-3 virus may be more effective in assisting with the correct processing of the E protein. The results of this study may be used to increase the in vitro production of the E protein antigen for use in vaccines and for diagnostic purposes.

SP  - 139
EP  - 45
AB  - Caveolae- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis are major internalization pathways used by several pathogens; however, their distinctive roles in dengue virus (DV) entry have not been addressed. In this study, we compared the involvement of caveolae- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the infectious entry of DV serotype 2 (DV2) into human endothelial-like ECV304 cells. Confocal microscopy study on DV2-infected cells showed that viral antigens were co-localized with clathrin heavy chains, epidermal growth factor pathway substrate clone 15 (Eps15), and adaptin-alpha, but not with caveolin-1. Treatment with chlorpromazine, which inhibits clathrin-dependent endocytosis, led to reduced virus entry into cells, whereas treatment with nystatin, a caveolae inhibitory agent, did not. Furthermore, gene silencing of Eps15 resulted in an average of 75% reduced infection of ECV304 cells by DV2. Our results demonstrated that DV2 enters ECV304 cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, not by caveolae-dependent endocytosis.

TI  - Essential Role of Dengue Virus Envelope Protein N Glycosylation at Asparagine-67 during Viral Propagation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 7136
EP  - 7148
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus envelope protein (E) contains two N-linked glycosylation sites, at Asn-67 and Asn-153. The glycosylation site at position 153 is conserved in most flaviviruses, while the site at position 67 is thought to be unique for dengue viruses. N-linked oligosaccharide side chains on flavivirus E proteins have been associated with viral morphogenesis, infectivity, and tropism. Here, we examined the relevance of each N-linked glycan on dengue virus E protein by removing each site in the context of infectious viral particles. Dengue viruses lacking Asn-67 were able to infect mammalian cells and translate and replicate the viral genome, but production of new infectious particles was abolished. In addition, dengue viruses lacking Asn-153 in the E showed reduced infectivity. In contrast, ablation of one or both glycosylation sites yielded viruses that replicate and propagate in mosquito cells. Furthermore, we found a differential requirement of N-linked glycans for E secretion in mammalian and mosquito cells. While secretion of E lacking Asn-67 was efficient in mosquito cells, secretion of the same protein expressed in mammalian cells was dramatically impaired. Finally, we found that viruses lacking the carbohydrate at position 67 showed reduced infection of immature dendritic cells, suggesting interaction between this glycan and the lectin DC-SIGN. Overall, our data defined different roles for the two glycans present at the E protein during dengue virus infection, highlighting the involvement of distinct host functions from mammalian and mosquito cells during dengue virus propagation.

TI  - Essential role of platelet-activating factor receptor in the pathogenesis of Dengue virus infection
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 106
SP  - 14138
EP  - 14143
AB  - Severe dengue infection in humans causes a disease characterized by thrombocytopenia, increased levels of cytokines, increased vascular permeability, hemorrhage, and shock. Treatment is supportive. Activation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor (PAFR) on endothelial cells and leukocytes induces increase in vascular permeability, hypotension, and production of cytokines. We hypothesized that activation of PAFR could account for the major systemic manifestations of dengue infection. Inoculation of adult mice with an adapted strain of Dengue virus caused a systemic disease, with several features of the infection in humans. In PAFR−/− mice, there was decreased thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, decreased systemic levels of cytokines, and delay of lethality, when compared with WT infected mice. Treatment with UK-74,505, an orally active PAFR antagonist, prevented the above-mentioned manifestations, as well as hypotension and increased vascular permeability, and decreased lethality, even when started 5 days after virus inoculation. Similar results were obtained with a distinct PAFR antagonist, PCA-4246. Despite decreased disease manifestation, viral loads were similar (PAFR−/−) or lower (PAFR antagonist) than in WT mice. Thus, activation of PAFR plays a major role in the pathogenesis of experimental dengue infection, and its blockade prevents more severe disease manifestation after infection with no increase in systemic viral titers, suggesting that there is no interference in the ability of the murine host to deal with the infection. PAFR antagonists are disease-modifying agents in experimental dengue infection.

AB  - INTRODUCTION
Host genetics is recognized as an influential factor for the development of dengue disease.


OBJECTIVE
This study evaluated the association of dengue with the polymorphisms rs8192284 for gene IL6R, rs3775290 for TLR3, and rs7248637 for DC-SIGN.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Of the 292 surveyed subjects, 191 were confirmed for dengue fever and the remaining 101 were included as controls. The genotypes were resolved using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP). In an attempt to determine the risk (Odds Ratio) of suffering dengue fever, data were analyzed using chi-square for alleles and logistic regression for both genotypes and allelic combinations. Confidence intervals were set to 95% for all tests regardless of the adjustment by either self-identification or ancestry.


RESULTS
For Afro-Colombians, the allele rs8192284 C offered protection against dengue [OR=0.425,(0.204-0.887), p=0.020]. The alleles rs7248637 A and rs3775290 A posed, respectively, an increased risk of dengue for Afro-Colombians [OR=2.389, (1.170-4.879), p=0.015] and Mestizos [OR=2.329, (1.283-4.226), p=0.005]. The reproducibility for rs8192284 C/C [OR=2.45, (1.05-5.76), p=0.013] remained after adjustment by Amerindian ancestry [OR=2.52, (1.04-6.09), p=0.013]. The reproducibility for rs3775290 A/A [OR=2.48, (1.09-5.65), p=0.033] remained after adjustment by European [OR=2.34, (1.02-5.35), p=0.048], Amerindian [OR=2.49, (1.09-5.66), p=0.035], and African ancestry [OR=2.37, (1.04-5.41), p=0.046]. Finally, the association of dengue fever with the allelic combination CAG [OR=2.07, (1.06-4.05), p=0.033] remained after adjustment by Amerindian ancestry [OR=2.16, (1.09-4.28), p=0.028].


CONCLUSIONS
Polymorphisms rs8192284 for IL6R, rs3775290 for TLR3, and rs7248637 for DC-SIGN were associated with the susceptibility to suffer dengue fever in the sampled Colombian population.

AB  - Dengue Virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne virus, is a member of the Flaviviridae family and transmits to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, most often Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) and Ae. Albopictus. DENV includes four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) [1]. Generally, infected patients experience a spectrum of clinical diseases ranging from an acute debilitating self-limited dengue fever (DF) to a life-threatening syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock syndrome (DSS). At present, no specific antiviral drugs and vaccines are available against DENV. Therefore, DENV infections cause dramatic public health issues in more than 100 countries and regions, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions in the world. The geographic expansion of the vector contributes to a widespread of disease with various severities.

TI  - Evidence for Host Epigenetic Signatures Arising From Arbovirus Infections: A Systematic Review
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 10
AB  - Background: Arbovirus infections have steadily become a major pandemic threat. This study aimed at investigating the existence of host epigenetic markers arising from the principal arboviruses infections impacting on human health. We set to systematically review all published evidence describing any epigenetic modifications associated with infections from arboviruses, including, but not limited to, microRNAs, DNA methylation, and histone modifications. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Science Direct and Cochrane Library from inception to January 4th, 2018. We included reports describing original in vivo or in vitro studies investigating epigenetic changes related to arbovirus infections in either clinical subjects or human cell lines. Studies investigating epigenetic modifications related to the virus or the arthropod vector were excluded. A narrative synthesis of the findings was conducted, contextualizing comparative evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies. Results: A total of 853 unique references were identified and screened by two independent researchers. Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. The evidence was centered mainly on microRNA and DNA methylation signatures implicated with secondary Dengue fever. Evidence for recent epidemic threats, such as the infections by Zika or Chikungunya viruses is still scant. Conclusions: Major epigenetic alterations found on arboviruses infections were miR-146, miR-30e and the Dicer complex. However, existing studies frequently tested distinct hypotheses resulting in a heterogeneity of methodological approaches. Whilst epigenetic signatures associated with arbovirus infections have been reported, existing studies have largely focused on a small number of diseases, particularly dengue. Validation of epigenetic signatures have an untapped potential, but concerted investigations are certainly required to deliver robust candidates of clinical utility for diagnosis, staging and prognosis of specific arboviral diseases.

TI  - Evidence for a Genetic and Physical Interaction between Nonstructural Proteins NS1 and NS4B That Modulates Replication of West Nile Virus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 7360
EP  - 7371
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus NS1 is a nonstructural glycoprotein that is expressed on the cell surface and secreted into the extracellular space. Despite its transit through the secretory pathway, NS1 is an essential gene linked to early viral RNA replication. How this occurs has remained a mystery given the disparate localization of NS1 and the viral RNA replication complex, as the latter is present on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We recently identified an N-terminal di-amino acid motif in NS1 that modulates protein targeting and affected viral replication. Exchange of two amino acids at positions 10 and 11 from dengue virus (DENV) into West Nile virus (WNV) NS1 (RQ10NK) changed its relative surface expression and secretion and attenuated infectivity. However, the phenotype of WNV containing NS1 RQ10NK was unstable, as within two passages heterogeneous plaque variants were observed. Here, using a mutant WNV encoding the NS1 RQ10NK mutation, we identified a suppressor mutation (F86C) in NS4B, a virally encoded transmembrane protein with loops on both the luminal and cytoplasmic sides of the ER membrane. Introduction of NS4B F86C specifically rescued RNA replication of mutant WNV but did not affect the wild-type virus. Mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation studies established a novel physical interaction between NS1 and NS4B, suggesting a mechanism for how luminal NS1 conveys signals to the cytoplasm to regulate RNA replication.

TI  - Evidence for the existence of a pseudoknot structure at the 3' terminus of the flavivirus genomic RNA.
JF  - Biochemistry
VL  - 35 13
SP  - 4222
EP  - 30
AB  - The 3'-terminal nucleotides of the flavivirus genomic RNA form conserved secondary structures that may function as cis-acting signals for RNA replication. Here we provide evidence for the existence of a conserved pseudoknot structure at the 3' terminus of the flavivirus genomic RNA. A truncated version of the West Nile virus (WNV) 3'-terminal RNA sequence was used as the model for these studies. Circular dichroism spectra indicated the presence of a highly structured RNA conformation with a significant amount of A-form helix. Ribonuclease probing not only confirmed the presence of the predicted secondary structure, which consists of a long stem-loop (SL1) and a shorter stem-loop (SL2), but also suggested that base pairing occurs between nucleotides in the loop of SL2 and those in an internal loop strand located on the 5' side of SL1. Analysis of three mutant RNAs further supported the existence of pseudoknot interactions. UV-melting analysis of the WNV 3' model RNA showed three transitions with significant hyperchromicity at approximately 46, 62, and 79 degrees C. UV-melting analysis with either SL1 or SL2 RNA alone suggested that the 62 and 79 degree C transitions represent the unfolding of SL2 and SL1, respectively. The 46 degree C transition is most likely due to the opening of the proposed tertiary structure. A similar melting curve was obtained for another flavivirus (dengue-3 virus) 3'-terminal RNA, providing further support for the conservation of the structure among flaviviruses. Molecular modeling of the RNA indicated that a pseudoknot structure is a stereochemically and energetically reasonable model for the 3' terminus of flavivirus genomic RNA.

TI  - Evidence of HLA-DQB1 Contribution to Susceptibility of Dengue Serotype 3 in Dengue Patients in Southern Brazil
JF  - Journal of Tropical Medicine
VL  - 2014
AB  - Dengue infection (DI) transmitted by arthropod vectors is the viral disease with the highest incidence throughout the world, an estimated 300 million cases per year. In addition to environmental factors, genetic factors may also influence the manifestation of the disease; as even in endemic areas, only a small proportion of people develop the most serious form. Immune-response gene polymorphisms may be associated with the development of cases of DI. The aim of this study was to determine allele frequencies in the HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1 loci in a Southern Brazil population with dengue virus serotype 3, confirmed by the ELISA serological method, and a control group. The identification of the HLA alleles was carried out using the SSO genotyping PCR program (One Lambda), based on Luminex technology. In conclusion, this study suggests that DQB1∗06:11 allele could act as susceptible factors to dengue virus serotype 3, while HLA-DRB1∗11 and DQA1∗05:01 could act as resistance factors.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. Although several molecules have been described as part of DENV receptor complex in mosquito cells, none of them have been identified. Our group characterized two glycoproteins (40 and 45 kD) as part of the DENV receptor complex in C6/36 cells. Because identification of the mosquito cell receptor has been unsuccessful and some cell receptors described for DENV in mammalian cells are heat-shock proteins (HSPs), the role of HSPs in DENV binding and infection in C6/36 cells was evaluated. Our results indicate that gp45 and a 74-kD molecule (p74), which interact with DENV envelope protein, are immunologically related to HSP90. Although p74 is induced by heat shock, gp45 apparently is not. However, these proteins are relocated to the cell surface after heat-shock treatment, causing an increase in virus binding without any effect on virus yield.

TI  - Exosomes and Their Role in the Life Cycle and Pathogenesis of RNA Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 7
SP  - 3204
EP  - 3225
AB  - Exosomes are membrane-enclosed vesicles actively released into the extracellular space, whose content reflect the physiological/pathological state of the cells they originate from. These vesicles participate in cell-to-cell communication and transfer of biologically active proteins, lipids, and RNAs. Their role in viral infections is just beginning to be appreciated. RNA viruses are an important class of pathogens and affect millions of people worldwide. Recent studies on Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV), and Dengue Virus (DENV) have demonstrated that exosomes released from infected cells harbor and deliver many regulatory factors including viral RNA and proteins, viral and cellular miRNA, and other host functional genetic elements to neighboring cells, helping to establish productive infections and modulating cellular responses. Exosomes can either spread or limit an infection depending on the type of pathogen and target cells, and can be exploited as candidates for development of antiviral or vaccine treatments. This review summarizes recent progress made in understanding the role of exosomes in RNA virus infections with an emphasis on their potential contribution to pathogenesis.

TI  - Expansion of highly activated invariant natural killer T cells with altered phenotype in acute dengue infection
JF  - Clinical & Experimental Immunology
VL  - 185
AB  - Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are capable of rapid activation and production of cytokines upon recognition of antigenic lipids presented by CD1d molecules. They have been shown to play a significant role in many viral infections and were observed to be highly activated in patients with acute dengue infection. In order to characterize further their role in dengue infection, we investigated the proportion of iNKT cells and their phenotype in adult patients with acute dengue infection. The functionality of iNKT cells in patients was investigated by both interferon (IFN)‐γ and interleukin (IL)−4 ex‐vivo enzyme‐linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays following stimulation with alpha‐galactosyl‐ceramide (αGalCer). We found that circulating iNKT cell proportions were significantly higher (P = 0·03) in patients with acute dengue when compared to healthy individuals and were predominantly of the CD4+ subset. iNKT cells of patients with acute dengue had reduced proportions expressing CD8α and CD161 when compared to healthy individuals. The iNKT cells of patients were highly activated and iNKT activation correlated significantly with dengue virus‐specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody levels. iNKT cells expressing Bcl‐6 (P = 0·0003) and both Bcl‐6 and inducible T cell co‐stimulator (ICOS) (P = 0·006) were increased significantly in patients when compared to healthy individuals. Therefore, our data suggest that in acute dengue infection there is an expansion of highly activated CD4+ iNKT cells, with reduced expression of CD161 markers.

TI  - Experimental Dengue Virus Type 4 Infection Increases the Expression of MicroRNAs-15/16, Triggering a Caspase-Induced Apoptosis Pathway
JF  - Current Issues in Molecular Biology
VL  - 45
SP  - 4589
EP  - 4599
AB  - The World Health Organization has estimated the annual occurrence of approximately 392 million dengue virus (DENV) infections in more than 100 countries where the virus is endemic, which represents a serious threat to humanity. DENV is a serologic group with four distinct serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) belonging to the genus Flavivirus, in the family Flaviviridae. Dengue is the most widespread mosquito-borne disease in the world. The ~10.7 kb DENV genome encodes three structural proteins (capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM), and envelope (E)) and seven non-structural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). The NS1 protein is a membrane-associated dimer and a secreted, lipid-associated hexamer. Dimeric NS1 is found on membranes both in cellular compartments and cell surfaces. Secreted NS1 (sNS1) is often present in patient serum at very high levels, which correlates with severe dengue symptoms. This study was conducted to discover how the NS1 protein, microRNAs-15/16 (miRNAs-15/16), and apoptosis are related during DENV-4 infection in human liver cell lines. Huh 7.5 and HepG2 cells were infected with DENV-4, and miRNAs-15/16, viral load, NS1 protein, and caspases-3/7 were quantified after different durations of infection. This study demonstrated that miRNAs-15/16 were overexpressed during the infection of HepG2 and Huh 7.5 cells with DENV-4 and had a relationship with NS1 protein expression, viral load, and the activity of caspases-3/7, thus making these miRNAs potential injury markers during DENV infection in human hepatocytes.

TI  - Experimental adaptation of dengue virus 1 to Aedes albopictus mosquitoes by in vivo selection
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 10
AB  - In most of the world, Dengue virus (DENV) is mainly transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti while in Europe, Aedes albopictus is responsible for human DENV cases since 2010. Identifying mutations that make DENV more competent for transmission by Ae. albopictus will help to predict emergence of epidemic strains. Ten serial passages in vivo in Ae. albopictus led to select DENV-1 strains with greater infectivity for this vector in vivo and in cultured mosquito cells. These changes were mediated by multiple adaptive mutations in the virus genome, including a mutation at position 10,418 in the DENV 3′UTR within an RNA stem-loop structure involved in subgenomic flavivirus RNA production. Using reverse genetics, we showed that the 10,418 mutation alone does not confer a detectable increase in transmission efficiency in vivo. These results reveal the complex adaptive landscape of DENV transmission by mosquitoes and emphasize the role of epistasis in shaping evolutionary trajectories of DENV variants.

TI  - Experimental dengue virus challenge of human subjects previously vaccinated with live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccines.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 207 5
SP  - 700
EP  - 8
AB  - BACKGROUND
Protection against dengue requires immunity against all 4 serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). Experimental challenge may be useful in evaluating vaccine-induced immunity.


METHODS
Ten subjects previously vaccinated with a live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine (TDV) and 4 DENV-naive control subjects were challenged by subcutaneous inoculation of either 10(3) plaque-forming units (PFU) of DENV-1 or 10(5) PFU of DENV-3. Two additional subjects who did not develop DENV-3 neutralizing antibody (NAb) from TDV were revaccinated with 10(4) PFU of live attenuated DENV-3 vaccine to evaluate memory response.


RESULTS
All 5 TDV recipients were protected against DENV-1 challenge. Of the 5 TDV recipients challenged with DENV-3, 2 were protected. All DENV-3-challenge subjects who developed viremia also developed elevated liver enzyme levels, and 2 had values that were >10 times greater than normal. Of the 2 subjects revaccinated with DENV-3 vaccine, 1 showed a secondary response to DENV-2, while neither showed such response to DENV-3. All 4 control subjects developed dengue fever from challenge. Protection was associated with presence of NAb, although 1 subject was protected despite a lack of measurable NAb at the time of DENV-1 challenge.


CONCLUSIONS
Vaccination with TDV induced variable protection against subcutaneous challenge. DENV-3 experimental challenge was associated with transient but marked elevations of transaminases.

AB  - In the absence of effective drugs or vaccines for the treatment of the five Dengue Virus serotypes, the search for novel antiviral drugs is of primary importance for the scientific community. In this context, drug repurposing represents the most used strategy; however, the study of host targets is now attracting attention since it allows identification of broad-spectrum drugs endowed with high genetic barrier. In the last ten years our research group identified several small molecules DDX3X inhibitors and proved their efficacy against different viruses including novel emerging ones. Herein, starting from a screening of our compounds, we designed and synthesized novel derivatives with potent activity and high selectivity. Finally, we synthesized a fluorescent inhibitor that allowed us to study DDX3X cellular localization during DENV infection in vitro. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that our inhibitor colocalized with DDX3X, promoting the reduction of infected cells and recovering the number of viable cells.

TI  - Exploring the Intricacies of Encephalitis in Mosquito-Borne Diseases through Vector-Host-Pathogen Interactions: A Critical Review
JF  - Journal of Clinical Medical Research
AB  - Environmental changes, medication resistance and sociodemographic shifts have all contributed to a dramatic increase in vector-borne diseases in the last 40 years, impacting both people and domestic animals. Pandemics like the Dengue fever epidemic that hit Bangladesh in 2023 show how devastating these illnesses may be on a global scale. The authors of this work stress the significance of comprehending vector-host-pathogen pathways via their examination of arboviruses in Asia. The ecology and biology of Culex, Culiseta and Aedes species in connection to Dengue Virus, Japanese Encephalitis (JE), Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE) are explored in a thorough literature review that utilizes MeSH terminology. Beginning with the Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), this article examines the virus’s transmission from insects to vertebrates and, inadvertently, to humans as a disease. We then go on to dengue encephalitis, breaking its intricate pathophysiology into parts. This includes aspects like immune-mediated consequences, systemic problems and direct invasion. The Aedes mosquito is a key player in the human-mosquito-human cycle that transmits Dengue Virus (DENV) and the extrinsic incubation time impacts outbreaks. Continuing to focus on the neuroinvasive effects on horses and people, we have Eastern Equine Encephalopathy (EEE). The interaction between birds and Culiseta melanura mosquitoes highlights the transmission of the enzootic cycle. At last, we look at Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE), which WEEV causes and how it affects both horses and people. Importantly, Culex species, which include mosquitoes and birds, serve as vectors in the enzootic cycle. Factors including climate change and international travel are included in the study’s conclusion, which emphasizes the significance of continuing research to monitor and reduce the worldwide effect of these arboviruses.

TI  - Exposure of Platelets to Dengue Virus and Envelope Protein Domain III Induces Nlrp3 Inflammasome-Dependent Platelet Cell Death and Thrombocytopenia in Mice
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - In tropical and subtropical regions, mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV) infections can lead to severe dengue, also known as dengue hemorrhage fever, which causes bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and blood plasma leakage and increases mortality. Although DENV-induced platelet cell death was linked to disease severity, the role of responsible viral factors and the elicitation mechanism of abnormal platelet activation and cell death remain unclear. DENV and virion-surface envelope protein domain III (EIII), a cellular binding moiety of the virus particle, highly increase during the viremia stage. Our previous report suggested that exposure to such viremia EIII levels can lead to cell death of endothelial cells, neutrophils, and megakaryocytes. Here we found that both DENV and EIII could induce abnormal platelet activation and predominantly necrotic cell death pyroptosis. Blockages of EIII-induced platelet signaling using the competitive inhibitor chondroitin sulfate B or selective Nlrp3 inflammasome inhibitors OLT1177 and Z-WHED-FMK markedly ameliorated DENV- and EIII-induced thrombocytopenia, platelet activation, and cell death. These results suggest that EIII could be considered as a virulence factor of DENV, and that Nlrp3 inflammasome is a feasible target for developing therapeutic approaches against dengue-induced platelet defects.

TI  - Exposure to Dengue Envelope Protein Domain III Induces Nlrp3 Inflammasome-Dependent Endothelial Dysfunction and Hemorrhage in Mice
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - Typically occurring during secondary dengue virus (DENV) infections, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) causes abnormal immune responses, as well as endothelial vascular dysfunction, for which the responsible viral factor remains unclear. During peak viremia, the plasma levels of virion-associated envelope protein domain III (EIII) increases to a point at which cell death is sufficiently induced in megakaryocytes in vitro. Thus, EIII may constitute a virulence factor for endothelial damage. In this study, we examined endothelial cell death induced by treatment with DENV and EIII in vitro. Notably, pyroptosis, the major type of endothelial cell death observed, was attenuated through treatment with Nlrp3 inflammasome inhibitors. EIII injection effectively induced endothelial abnormalities, and sequential injection of EIII and DENV-NS1 autoantibodies induced further vascular damage, liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage, which are typical manifestations in DHF. Under the same treatments, pathophysiological changes in the Nlrp3 inflammasome–deficient mice were notably reduced compared with those in the wild-type mice. These results suggest that the Nlrp3 inflammasome constitutes a potential therapeutic target for treating DENV-induced hemorrhage in DHF.

TI  - Expression of Four Cytokine/Chemokine Genes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells infected with Dengue Virus
JF  - Indonesian Journal of Tropical and Infectious Disease
AB  - Overproduction of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines, during dengue virus (DENV) infection, has been related to plasma leakage in the vascular endothelium and studied elsewhere with conflicting results. The current study objective is to evaluate the expression of four cytokine/chemokine genes following DENV-2 infection within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from a healthy donor. Venous blood was drawn,  and PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Cells were maintained in culture medium and infected with Indonesian isolate of DENV-2. Cells were harvested and followed by total RNA extraction and reverse-transcription into cDNA using oligo d(T) primers and Reverse Transcriptase enzyme system. The SYBR Green-based quantitative qRT-PCR was used to calculate the relative expression of IL-6, IL-8, IP-10 and MIP-1β- encoding genes during infection time points, compared to uninfected cell controls. The observation of the cytokine was on the 6 and 18 hours post-infection. The different expression profiles of cytokines/chemokines were observed. The up-regulation of gene expression was observed for IL-8 and IP-10. In contrast, the down-regulatory of IL-6 and MIP-1β genes expression was documented during the infection period. The cytokine IL-8 and IP-10 are potent chemoattractants  in the recruitment  of neutrophil, basophil, and lymphocytes in response to an infection. The highlight of this study is on the up-regulation of IL-8 and IP-10 genes expression which may confirm the roles of these chemokines in the pathogenesis of dengue infection.

TI  - Expression of fatty acid synthase genes and their role in development and arboviral infection of Aedes aegypti
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 15
AB  - Fatty acids are the building blocks of complex lipids essential for living organisms. In mosquitoes, fatty acids are involved in cell membrane production, energy conservation and expenditure, innate immunity, development and reproduction. Fatty acids are synthesized by a multifunctional enzyme complex called fatty acid synthase (FAS). Several paralogues of FAS were found in the Aedes aegypti mosquito. However, the molecular characteristics and expression of some of these paralogues have not been investigated. Genome assemblies of Ae. aegypti were analyzed, and orthologues of human FAS was identified. Phylogenetic analysis and in silico molecular characterization were performed to identify the functional domains of the Ae. aegypti FAS (AaFAS). Quantitative analysis and loss-of-function experiments were performed to determine the significance of different AaFAS transcripts in various stages of development, expression following different diets and the impact of AaFAS on dengue virus, serotype 2 (DENV2) infection and transmission. We identified seven putative FAS genes in the Ae. aegypti genome assembly, based on nucleotide similarity to the FAS proteins (tBLASTn) of humans, other mosquitoes and invertebrates. Bioinformatics and molecular analyses suggested that only five of the AaFAS genes produce mRNA and therefore represent complete gene models. Expression levels of AaFAS varied among developmental stages and between male and female Ae. aegypti. Quantitative analyses revealed that expression of AaFAS1, the putative orthologue of the human FAS, was highest in adult females. Transient knockdown (KD) of AaFAS1 did not induce a complete compensation by other AaFAS genes but limited DENV2 infection of Aag2 cells in culture and the midgut of the mosquito. AaFAS1 is the predominant AaFAS in adult mosquitoes. It has the highest amino acid similarity to human FAS and contains all enzymatic domains typical of human FAS. AaFAS1 also facilitated DENV2 replication in both cell culture and in mosquito midguts. Our data suggest that AaFAS1 may play a role in transmission of dengue viruses and could represent a target for intervention strategies.

JF  - Research, Society and Development
VL  - 10
AB  - Objective: Evaluate the messenger RNAs (mRNA) PIWI proteins expression during infection with VDEN 4 in human hepatocyte cells. Materials and Methods: VDEN4 strain H778494 (JQ513335) was used, which was stored in Aedes albopictus cell culture (Clone C6 / 36) at the Arbovirology and Hemorrhagic Fevers section of the Evandro Chagas Institute. The techniques of cell cultures, stock (C6/36), inoculation, extraction, viral load quantification, RTqPCR and statistical analyzes were performed at the Viral Biogenesis Laboratory. Results: According to the results obtained, two cells (HepG2 and Huh7.5) demonstrated a higher level of viral replication at 72 hours post infection (hpi). The PIWI 2 target alter its mRNA expression during VDEN4 infection. The PIWI 4 target expression, was observed an altered expression in the infected cells. Thus, it was found that they are in different poles, while the viral load in the first three days showed high expression. The expression of mRNA was low in relation to the normal rate given by the uninfected cells. Conclusion: In our findings, it was observed that PIWI2 and 4 proteins have an inverse relationship to the viral infection process by VDEN4, when there is an increase in viral replication, these two proteins end up having a significant reduction in their expression. Probably, this reduction of expression is involved with the biogenesis process of apoptosis-regulating microRNAs.

JF  - Virology
VL  - 299 1
SP  - 122
EP  - 32
AB  - Dengue virus type 2 (DEN2), a member of the Flaviviridae family of positive-strand RNA viruses, contains a single RNA genome having a type I cap structure at the 5' end. The viral RNA is translated to produce a single polyprotein precursor that is processed to yield three virion proteins and at least seven nonstructural proteins (NS) in the infected host. NS3 is a multifunctional protein having a serine protease catalytic triad within the N-terminal 180 amino acid residues which requires NS2B as a cofactor for activation of protease activity. The C-terminal portion of this catalytic triad has conserved motifs present in several nucleoside triphosphatases (NTPases)/RNA helicases. In addition, subtilisin-treated West Nile (WN) virus NS3 from infected cells was reported to have 5'-RNA triphosphatase activity, suggesting its role in the synthesis of the 5'-cap structure. In this study, full-length DEN2 NS3 was expressed with an N-terminal histidine tag in Escherichia coli and purified in a soluble form. The purified protein has 5'-RNA triphosphatase activity that cleaves the gamma-phosphate moiety of the 5'-triphosphorylated RNA substrate. Biochemical and mutational analyses of the NS3 protein indicate that the nucleoside triphosphatase and 5'-RNA triphosphatase activities of NS3 share a common active site.

TI  - Extensive recoding of dengue virus type 2 specifically reduces replication in primate cells without gain-of-function in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), an arthropod-borne (“arbovirus”) virus causing a range of human maladies ranging from self-limiting dengue fever to the life-threatening dengue shock syndrome, proliferates well in two different taxa of the Animal Kingdom, mosquitoes and primates. Unexpectedly, mosquitoes and primates have distinct preferences when expressing their genes by translation, e.g. members of these taxa show taxonomic group-specific intolerance to certain codon pairs. This is called “codon pair bias”. By necessity, arboviruses evolved to delicately balance this fundamental difference in their ORFs. Using the mosquito-borne human pathogen DENV we have undone the evolutionarily conserved genomic balance in its ORF sequence and specifically shifted the encoding preference away from primates. However, this recoding of DENV raised concerns of ‘gain-of-function,’ namely whether recoding could inadvertently increase fitness for replication in the arthropod vector. Using mosquito cell cultures and two strains of Aedes aegypti we did not observe any increase in fitness in DENV2 variants codon pair deoptimized for humans. This ability to disrupt and control an arbovirus’s host preference has great promise towards developing the next generation of synthetic vaccines not only for DENV but for other emerging arboviral pathogens such as chikungunya virus and Zika virus.

TI  - Extracellular Vesicles Are Conveyors of the NS1 Toxin during Dengue Virus and Zika Virus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs), produced during viral infections, are of emerging interest in understanding infectious processes and host–pathogen interactions. EVs and exosomes in particular have the natural ability to transport nucleic acids, proteins, and other components of cellular or viral origin. Thus, they participate in intercellular communication, immune responses, and infectious and pathophysiological processes. Some viruses are known to hijack the cell production and content of EVs for their benefit. Here, we investigate whether two pathogenic flaviviruses i.e., Zika Virus (ZIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV2) could have an impact on the features of EVs. The analysis of EVs produced by infected cells allowed us to identify that the non-structural protein 1 (NS1), described as a viral toxin, is associated with exosomes. This observation could be confirmed under conditions of overexpression of recombinant NS1 from each flavivirus. Using different isolation methods (i.e., exosome isolation kit, size exclusion chromatography, Polyethylene Glycol enrichment, and ELISA capture), we showed that NS1 was present as a dimer at the surface of excreted exosomes, and that this association could occur in the extracellular compartment. This finding could be of major importance in a physiological context. Indeed, this capacity of NS1 to address EVs and its implication in the pathophysiology during Dengue or Zika diseases should be explored. Furthermore, exosomes that have demonstrated a natural capacity to vectorize NS1 could serve as useful tools for vaccine development.

TI  - Extracellular vesicles from CLEC2-activated platelets enhance dengue virus-induced lethality via CLEC5A/TLR2
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 10
AB  - Platelet-leukocyte interactions amplify inflammatory reactions, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. CLEC5A and CLEC2 are spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)-coupled C-type lectin receptors, abundantly expressed by leukocytes and platelets, respectively. Whereas CLEC5A is a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) to flaviviruses and bacteria, CLEC2 is the receptor for platelet-activating snake venom aggretin. Here we show that dengue virus (DV) activates platelets via CLEC2 to release extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes (EXOs) and microvesicles (MVs). DV-induced EXOs (DV-EXOs) and MVs (DV-MVs) further activate CLEC5A and TLR2 on neutrophils and macrophages, thereby induce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and proinflammatory cytokine release. Compared to stat1−/− mice, simultaneous blockade of CLEC5A and TLR2 effectively attenuates DV-induced inflammatory response and increases survival rate from 30 to 90%. The identification of critical roles of CLEC2 and CLEC5A/TLR2 in platelet-leukocyte interactions will support the development of novel strategies to treat acute viral infection in the future. Dengue virus (DENV) promotes leukocyte-platelet interactions that contribute to pathogenesis. Here, the authors report a role for C-type lectins CLEC2 and CLEC5A in platelet activation and NET formation and show that blockade of CLEC5A and TLR2 attenuates inflammation and increases survival of infected mice.

TI  - Extracellular vesicles of U937 macrophage cell line infected with DENV-2 induce activation in endothelial cells EA.hy926
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 15
AB  - Endothelial activation and alteration during dengue virus (DENV) infection are multifactorial events; however, the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in these phenomena is not known. In the present study, we characterized the EVs released by DENV-2 infected U937 macrophage cell line and evaluated the changes in the physiology and integrity of the EA.hy926 endothelial cells exposed to them. U937 macrophages were infected, supernatants were collected, and EVs were purified and characterized. Then, polarized endothelial EA.hy926 cells were exposed to the EVs for 24 h, and the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), monolayer permeability, and the expression of tight junction and adhesion proteins and cytokines were evaluated. The isolated EVs from infected macrophages corresponded to exosomes and apoptotic bodies, which contained the viral NS3 protein and different miRs, among other products. Exposure of EA.hy926 cells to EVs induced an increase in TEER, as well as changes in the expression of VE-cadherin and ICAM in addition leads to an increase in TNF-α, IP-10, IL-10, RANTES, and MCP-1 secretion. These results suggest that the EVs of infected macrophages transport proteins and miR that induce early changes in the physiology of the endothelium, leading to its activation and eliciting a defense program against damage during first stages of the disease, even in the absence of the virus.

TI  - Extracellular vesicles recovered from plasma of severe dengue patients induce CD4+ T cell suppression through PD-L1/PD-1 interaction
JF  - mBio
VL  - 14
AB  - ABSTRACT Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small membrane vesicles secreted into biological fluids, which play crucial roles in influencing the cellular function in different pathological processes. However, there is less clarity on how plasma EVs influence proliferation activation and functions of immune cells during dengue virus (DV) infection. In this study, we aimed to characterize circulating EVs from different categories of dengue patients and examined the consequence of naïve CD4+ T cells to EVs isolated from the plasma of mild or severe dengue patients. We observed that severe dengue infection was associated with an increased release of CD41a+ platelet extracellular vesicles compared with that from patients with mild disease or healthy donors. These EVs carried an increased level of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines along with immunoregulatory proteins on the surface that caused CD4+ T cell suppression. Treatment of purified naïve CD4+ T cells with EVs derived from severe dengue plasma drove CD4+ proliferation toward specific subtypes and modulated surface receptor CXCR3 and CCR6 expression. Subsequent studies indicated a notable rise in programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression within CD41a+ severe DV (SDV) EVs. Additionally, CD4+ T cells showed an elevated increase in programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) after incubating with SDV-EVs. We also demonstrated that blocking PD-L1 on SDV-EVs or PD-1 on late-activating CD4+ T cells partially reversed the SDV-EV-induced suppression of CD4+ T cell proliferation. Overall, our study highlights the immunosuppressive property of EVs derived from plasma of severe dengue patients, which might contribute to immune pathogenesis by shaping the immune response. IMPORTANCE Severe dengue manifestations caused by the dengue virus are a global health problem. Studies suggest that severe dengue disease depends on uncontrolled immune cell activation, and excessive inflammation adds to the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease. Therefore, it is important to understand the process that triggers the uncontrolled activation of the immune cells. The change in immune response in mild to severe dengue may be due to direct virus-to-cell interaction or it could be a contact-independent process through the extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from infected cells. The importance of circulating EVs in the context of dengue virus infection and pathogenesis remains unexplored. Therefore, understanding the possible biological function of circulating EVs may help to delineate the role of EVs in the progression of disease. Our present study highlights that EVs from plasma of severe dengue patients can have immunosuppressive properties on CD4+ T cells which may contribute to T cell suppression and may contribute to dengue disease progression.

TI  - Facilitation of cell adhesion by immobilized dengue viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1): arginine-glycine-aspartic acid structural mimicry within the dengue viral NS1 antigen.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 186 6
SP  - 743
EP  - 51
AB  - Dengue virus infection causes life-threatening hemorrhagic fever. Increasing evidence implies that dengue viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) exhibits a tendency to elicit potentially hazardous autoantibodies, which show a wide spectrum of specificity against extracellular matrix and platelet antigens. How NS1 elicits autoantibodies remains unclear. To address the hypothesis that NS1 and matrix proteins may have structural and functional similarity, cell-matrix and cell-NS1 interactions were evaluated using a cell-adhesion assay. The present study showed that dengue NS1 immobilized on coverslips resulted in more cell adhesion than did the control proteins. This cell adhesion was inhibited by peptides containing arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD), a motif important for integrin-mediated cell adhesion. In addition, anti-NS1 antibodies blocked RGD-mediated cell adhesion. Although there is no RGD motif in the NS1 protein sequence, these data indicate that RGD structural mimicry exists within the NS1 antigen.

TI  - Factors Associated with Dengue Shock Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 7
AB  - Background The pathogenesis of dengue shock syndrome (DSS, grade 3 and 4) is not yet completely understood. Several factors are reportedly associated with DSS, a more severe form of dengue infection that reportedly causes 50 times higher mortality compared to that of dengue patients without DSS. However, the results from these reports remain inconclusive. To better understand the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, and pathogenesis of DSS for development of new therapy, we systematically reviewed and performed a meta-analysis of relevant studies that reported factors in both DSS and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF, grade 1 and 2) patients. Methods and Findings PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Dengue Bulletin, Cochrane Library, Virtual Health Library, and a manual search of reference lists of articles published before September 2010 were used to retrieve relevant studies. A meta-analysis using fixed- or random-effects models was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) or event rate with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Assessment of heterogeneity and publication bias, meta-regression analysis, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and analysis of factor-specific relationships were further performed. There were 198 studies constituting 203 data sets that met our eligibility criteria. Our meta-regression analysis showed a sustained reduction of DSS/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) ratio over a period of 40 years in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand. The meta-analysis revealed that age, female sex, neurological signs, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, hemoconcentration, ascites, pleural effusion, hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, hepatomegaly, levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, thrombocytopenia, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, primary/secondary infection, and dengue virus serotype-2 were significantly associated with DSS when pooling all original relevant studies. Conclusions The results improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of DSS by identifying the association between the epidemiology, clinical signs, and biomarkers involved in DSS.

TI  - FasL/Fas pathway is involved in dengue virus induced apoptosis of the vascular endothelial cells
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 82
AB  - The hallmark of the dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome is hematologic abnormality. The pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome remains unknown. Our work showed that the dengue virus serotype‐2 induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Fas (CD95), Tumor Necrosis Factor receptors, and Tumor Necrosis Factor‐related apoptosis‐inducing ligand receptors are the most common death receptors, which can induce apoptosis. Compared with the untreated human umbilical vein endothelial cells, Fas expression was increased both in the mRNA level and on the surface of infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells. FasL was expressed at similar levels on human umbilical vein endothelial cells over a course of dengue virus serotype‐2 infection, but the expression in mRNA level was increased in infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells. It is possible that there is soluble FasL secreted from human umbilical vein endothelial cells in the supernatant. Tumor Necrosis Factor‐related apoptosis‐inducing ligand receptor 1 and Tumor Necrosis Factor receptors 1–2 were constantly very low, whereas Tumor Necrosis Factor‐related apoptosis‐inducing ligand receptors 2–4 decreased after dengue virus serotype‐2 infection. This result suggested that dengue virus serotype‐2 may inhibit Tumor Necrosis Factor‐related apoptosis‐inducing ligand receptors‐induced apoptosis. The apoptotic rates in human umbilical vein endothelial cells were decreased upon the addition of caspase family inhibitors. In addition, activated caspase 8 and caspase 3 were also observed by Western blot following dengue virus serotype‐2 infection. Thus, it is shown that the Fas/FasL pathway may participate in dengue virus‐induced apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells in vitro. J. Med. Virol. 82:1392–1399, 2010. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

AB  - Dengue is a disease of worldwide importance. To understand more about the pathogenesis of dengue the interest in the search for genetic factors in the host has recently increased. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes coding for DC-SIGN, Fc receptor (FcyRIIA) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) are associated with severe dengue and whether in this study group the severity of dengue is associated with secondary infections. A total of 200 cases of dengue patients were investigated in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, 100 cases of classic dengue and 100 cases of dengue hemorrhagic classified according to 2007 WHO criteria. Genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP and additionally this technique was compare to the iPLEX assay (SEQUENOM ® Inc. USA). A significantly increased risk of severe disease was observed in FcyRIIA in carriers of genotype CC versus TC (Chi2 = 5.29, P = 0.02, OR = 2.22). The G allele variant of the DC-SIGN1-336 was not associated with severe dengue disease. The VDR genotype frequency of CC genotype compared whit CT scan shows a tendency to increase in severe forms compared to mild forms of the disease (Chi2= 3.36, P= 0.06, OR= 0.35). These preliminary data provide new insights into the role of genetic factors in dengue; knowledge of more SNPs associated with dengue will provide information on possible mechanisms of pathogenesis and protection.

JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology
VL  - 25

EP  - 223
AB  - Dengue virus and other flaviviruses such as the yellow fever, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses are emerging vector‐borne human pathogens that affect annually more than 100 million individuals and that may cause debilitating and potentially fatal hemorrhagic and encephalitic diseases. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs for the treatment of flavivirus‐associated disease. A better understanding of the flavivirus–host interactions during the different events of the flaviviral life cycle may be essential when developing novel antiviral strategies. The flaviviral non‐structural protein 4b (NS4b) appears to play an important role in flaviviral replication by facilitating the formation of the viral replication complexes and in counteracting innate immune responses such as the following: (i) type I IFN signaling; (ii) RNA interference; (iii) formation of stress granules; and (iv) the unfolded protein response. Intriguingly, NS4b has recently been shown to constitute an excellent target for the selective inhibition of flavivirus replication. We here review the current knowledge on NS4b. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Flaviviruses are a genus of (+)ssRNA (positive ssRNA) enveloped viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of cells of diverse species from arthropods to mammals. Many are important human pathogens such as DENV-1-4 (dengue virus types 1-4), WNV (West Nile virus), YFV (yellow fever virus), JEV (Japanese encephalitis virus) and TBEV (tick-borne encephalitis). Given their RNA genomes it is not surprising that flaviviral life cycles revolve around critical RNA transactions. It is these we highlight in the present article. First, we summarize the mechanisms governing flaviviral replication and the central role of conserved RNA elements and viral protein-RNA interactions in RNA synthesis, translation and packaging. Secondly, we focus on how host RNA-binding proteins both benefit and inhibit flaviviral replication at different stages of their life cycle in mammalian hosts. Thirdly, we cover recent studies on viral non-coding RNAs produced in flavivirus-infected cells and how these RNAs affect various aspects of cellular RNA metabolism. Together, the article puts into perspective the central role of flaviviral RNAs in modulating both viral and cellular functions.

JF  - Viruses
VL  - 7
SP  - 4640
EP  - 4656
AB  - Genome replication in flavivirus requires (−) strand RNA synthesis, (+) strand RNA synthesis, and 5′-RNA capping and methylation. To carry out viral genome replication, flavivirus assembles a replication complex, consisting of both viral and host proteins, on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Two major components of the replication complex are the viral non-structural (NS) proteins NS3 and NS5. Together they possess all the enzymatic activities required for genome replication, yet how these activities are coordinated during genome replication is not clear. We provide an overview of the flaviviral genome replication process, the membrane-bound replication complex, and recent crystal structures of full-length NS5. We propose a model of how NS3 and NS5 coordinate their activities in the individual steps of (−) RNA synthesis, (+) RNA synthesis, and 5′-RNA capping and methylation.

AB  - Replication of positive-strand RNA viruses occurs in tight association with reorganized host cell membranes. In a concerted fashion, viral and cellular factors generate distinct organelle-like structures, designated viral replication factories. These virus-induced compartments promote highly efficient genome replication, allow spatiotemporal coordination of the different steps of the viral replication cycle, and protect viral RNA from the hostile cytoplasmic environment. The combined use of ultrastructural and functional studies has greatly increased our understanding of the architecture and biogenesis of viral replication factories. Here, we review common concepts and distinct differences in replication organelle morphology and biogenesis within the Flaviviridae family, exemplified by dengue virus and hepatitis C virus. We discuss recent progress made in our understanding of the complex interplay between viral determinants and subverted cellular membrane homeostasis in biogenesis and maintenance of replication factories of this virus family.

TI  - Flaviviridae Viruses and Oxidative Stress: Implications for Viral Pathogenesis
JF  - Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
VL  - 2019
AB  - Oxidative stress is induced once the balance of generation and neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is broken in the cell, and it plays crucial roles in a variety of natural and diseased processes. Infections of Flaviviridae viruses trigger oxidative stress, which affects both the cellular metabolism and the life cycle of the viruses. Oxidative stress associated with specific viral proteins, experimental culture systems, and patient infections, as well as its correlations with the viral pathogenesis attracts much research attention. In this review, we primarily focus on hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) as representatives of Flaviviridae viruses and we summarize the mechanisms involved in the relevance of oxidative stress for virus-associated pathogenesis. We discuss the current understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of oxidative stress induced by Flaviviridae viruses and highlight the relevance of autophagy and DNA damage in the life cycle of viruses. Understanding the crosstalk between viral infection and oxidative stress-induced molecular events may offer new avenues for antiviral therapeutics.

JF  - Journal of Viral Hepatitis
VL  - 6
AB  - Sequence motifs within the non‐structural protein NS5 or NS5B of the members of the family Flaviviridae suggest that this protein is the RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase. This protein has now been expressed in various in vitro systems and used in polymerase assays. To understand the role of the RNA polymerase in RNA replication, this review will examine not only the polymerase protein but also the other proteins in the RNA replication complex. To date, several groups have investigated the interaction of these proteins both in vitro and in vivo and also the interaction of these proteins with the RNA signals at the 3’ terminus of the RNA. Infectious clones and replicons containing the non‐structural proteins have now been generated and these will be useful tools in understanding the processes of initiation and elongation of both positive and negative RNA synthesis.

TI  - Flavivirus Activates Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling To Block Caspase-Dependent Apoptotic Cell Death at the Early Stage of Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79

AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DEN) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are medically important in humans. The lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream target Akt have been implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular functions such as proliferation, and apoptosis. Since JEV and DEN appear to trigger apoptosis in cultured cells at a rather late stage of infection, we evaluated the possible roles of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in flavivirus-infected cells. We found that Akt phosphorylation was noticeable in the JEV- and DEN serotype 2 (DEN-2)-infected neuronal N18 cells in an early, transient, PI3K- and lipid raft-dependent manner. Blocking of PI3K activation by its specific inhibitor LY294002 or wortmannin greatly enhanced virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPEs), even at an early stage of infection, but had no effect on virus production. This severe CPE was characterized as apoptotic cell death as evidenced by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) staining and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Mechanically, the initiator and effector caspases involved are mainly caspase-9 and caspase-6, since only a pan-caspase inhibitor and the inhibitors preferentially target caspase-9 and -6, but not the ones antagonizing caspase-8, -3, or -7 alleviated the levels of PARP cleavage after virus infection and PI3K blockage. Furthermore, Bcl-2 appears to be a crucial mediator downstream of PI3K/Akt signaling, since overexpression of Bcl-2 reduced virus-induced apoptosis even when PI3K activation was repressed. Collectively, our results suggest an antiapoptotic role for the PI3K/Akt pathway triggered by JEV and DEN-2 to protect infected cells from early apoptotic cell death.

TI  - Flavivirus Activation of Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Delineates Key Elements of TLR7 Signaling beyond Endosomal Recognition1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 177
SP  - 7114
EP  - 7121
AB  - TLR7 senses RNA in endosomal compartments. TLR7 expression and signaling have been demonstrated in plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells. The regulation of TLR7 signaling can play a crucial role in shaping the immune response to RNA viruses with different cellular tropisms, and in developing adjuvants capable of promoting balanced humoral and cell-mediated immunity. We used unique characteristics of two ssRNA viruses, dengue virus and influenza virus, to delineate factors that regulate viral RNA-human TLR7 signaling beyond recognition in endosomal compartments. Our data show that TLR7 recognition of enveloped RNA virus genomes is linked to virus fusion or uncoating from the endosome. The signaling threshold required to activate TLR7-type I IFN production is greater than that required to activate TLR7-NF-κB-IL-8 production. The higher order structure of viral RNA appears to be an important determinant of TLR7-signaling potency. A greater understanding of viral RNA-TLR7 activity relationships will promote rational approaches to interventional and vaccine strategies for important human viral pathogens.

TI  - Flavivirus Capsid Is a Dimeric Alpha-Helical Protein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 77

EP  - 7149
AB  - ABSTRACT The capsid proteins of two flaviviruses, yellow fever virus and dengue virus, were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity suitable for biochemical characterization and structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance. The oligomeric properties of the capsid protein in solution were investigated. In the absence of nucleic acid, both proteins were predominately dimeric in solution. Further analysis of both proteins with far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that they were largely alpha-helical. The secondary structure elements of the dengue virus capsid were determined by chemical shift indexing of the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments. The dengue virus capsid protein devoid of its C-terminal signal sequence was found to be composed of four alpha helices. The longest alpha helix, 20 residues, is located at the C terminus and has an amphipathic character. In contrast, the N terminus was found to be unstructured and could be removed without disrupting the structural integrity of the protein.

TI  - Flavivirus Capsid Proteins Inhibit the Interferon Response
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) establishes persistent infections in multiple human tissues, a phenomenon that likely plays a role in its ability to cause congenital birth defects and neurological disease. Multiple nonstructural proteins encoded by ZIKV, in particular NS5, are known to suppress the interferon (IFN) response by attacking different steps in this critical antiviral pathway. Less well known are the potential roles of structural proteins in affecting the host immune response during ZIKV infection. Capsid proteins of flaviviruses are of particular interest because a pool of these viral proteins is targeted to the nuclei during infection and, as such, they have the potential to affect host cell gene expression. In this study, RNA-seq analyses revealed that capsid proteins from six different flaviviruses suppress expression of type I IFN and IFN-stimulated genes. Subsequent interactome and in vitro ubiquitination assays showed that ZIKV capsid protein binds to and prevents activating ubiquitination of RIG-I CARD domains by TRIM25, a host factor that is important for the induction arm of the IFN response. The other flavivirus capsid proteins also interacted with TRIM25, suggesting that these viral proteins may attenuate antiviral signaling pathways at very early stages of infection, potentially even before nonstructural proteins are produced.

JF  - Viruses
VL  - 6
SP  - 69
EP  - 88
AB  - Flaviviruses enter host cells by endocytosis initiated when the virus particles interact with cell surface receptors. The current model suggests that flaviviruses use at least two different sets of molecules for infectious entry: attachment factors that concentrate and/or recruit viruses on the cell surface and primary receptor(s) that bind to virions and direct them to the endocytic pathway. Here, we present the currently available knowledge regarding the flavivirus receptors described so far with specific attention to C-type lectin receptors and the phosphatidylserine receptors, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) and TYRO3, AXL and MER (TAM). Their role in flavivirus attachment and entry as well as their implication in the virus biology will be discussed in depth.

TI  - Flavivirus Infection Activates the XBP1 Pathway of the Unfolded Protein Response To Cope with Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 11868
EP  - 11880
AB  - ABSTRACT The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a coordinated change in gene expression triggered by perturbations in functions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). XBP1, a key transcription factor of the UPR, is activated by an IRE1-mediated splicing event, which results in a frameshift and encodes a protein with transcriptional activity. Here, we report that XBP1 was activated during flaviviral infection, as evidenced by XBP1 mRNA splicing and protein expression, as well as induction of the downstream genes ERdj4, EDEM1, and p58(IPK) in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)- and dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN-2)-infected cells. Reporter systems based on IRE1-mediated XBP1 splicing were established, and several flaviviral proteins associated with the ER, including glycoproteins and small hydrophobic membrane-anchored proteins, were found to trigger the splicing event. Notably, nonstructural protein NS2B-3 of DEN-2, but not of JEV, was a potent inducer of XBP1 splicing through an unclear mechanism(s). Reduction of XBP1 by a small interfering RNA had no effect on cells' susceptibility to the two viruses but exacerbated the flavivirus-induced cytopathic effects. Overall, flaviviruses trigger the XBP1 signaling pathway and take advantage of this cellular response to alleviate virus-induced cytotoxicity.

TI  - Flavivirus Infection Impairs Peroxisome Biogenesis and Early Antiviral Signaling
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 12349
EP  - 12361
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses are significant human pathogens that have an enormous impact on the global health burden. Currently, there are very few vaccines against or therapeutic treatments for flaviviruses, and our understanding of how these viruses cause disease is limited. Evidence suggests that the capsid proteins of flaviviruses play critical nonstructural roles during infection, and therefore, elucidating how these viral proteins affect cellular signaling pathways could lead to novel targets for antiviral therapy. We used affinity purification to identify host cell proteins that interact with the capsid proteins of West Nile and dengue viruses. One of the cellular proteins that formed a stable complex with flavivirus capsid proteins is the peroxisome biogenesis factor Pex19. Intriguingly, flavivirus infection resulted in a significant loss of peroxisomes, an effect that may be due in part to capsid expression. We posited that capsid protein-mediated sequestration and/or degradation of Pex19 results in loss of peroxisomes, a situation that could result in reduced early antiviral signaling. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that induction of the lambda interferon mRNA in response to a viral RNA mimic was reduced by more than 80%. Together, our findings indicate that inhibition of peroxisome biogenesis may be a novel mechanism by which flaviviruses evade the innate immune system during early stages of infection. IMPORTANCE RNA viruses infect hundreds of millions of people each year, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Chief among these pathogens are the flaviviruses, which include dengue virus and West Nile virus. Despite their medical importance, there are very few prophylactic or therapeutic treatments for these viruses. Moreover, the manner in which they subvert the innate immune response in order to establish infection in mammalian cells is not well understood. Recently, peroxisomes were reported to function in early antiviral signaling, but very little is known regarding if or how pathogenic viruses affect these organelles. We report for the first time that flavivirus infection results in significant loss of peroxisomes in mammalian cells, which may indicate that targeting of peroxisomes is a key strategy used by viruses to subvert early antiviral defenses.

TI  - Flavivirus Infection Uncouples Translation Suppression from Cellular Stress Responses
JF  - mBio
VL  - 8
AB  - ABSTRACT As obligate parasites, viruses strictly depend on host cell translation for the production of new progeny, yet infected cells also synthesize antiviral proteins to limit virus infection. Modulation of host cell translation therefore represents a frequent strategy by which viruses optimize their replication and spread. Here we sought to define how host cell translation is regulated during infection of human cells with dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), two positive-strand RNA flaviviruses. Polysome profiling and analysis of de novo protein synthesis revealed that flavivirus infection causes potent repression of host cell translation, while synthesis of viral proteins remains efficient. Selective repression of host cell translation was mediated by the DENV polyprotein at the level of translation initiation. In addition, DENV and ZIKV infection suppressed host cell stress responses such as the formation of stress granules and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α (α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2). Mechanistic analyses revealed that translation repression was uncoupled from the disruption of stress granule formation and eIF2α signaling. Rather, DENV infection induced p38-Mnk1 signaling that resulted in the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E and was essential for the efficient production of virus particles. Together, these results identify the uncoupling of translation suppression from the cellular stress responses as a conserved strategy by which flaviviruses ensure efficient replication in human cells. IMPORTANCE For efficient production of new progeny, viruses need to balance their dependency on the host cell translation machinery with potentially adverse effects of antiviral proteins produced by the infected cell. To achieve this, many viruses evolved mechanisms to manipulate host cell translation. Here we find that infection of human cells with two major human pathogens, dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), leads to the potent repression of host cell translation initiation, while the synthesis of viral protein remains unaffected. Unlike other RNA viruses, these flaviviruses concomitantly suppress host cell stress responses, thereby uncoupling translation suppression from stress granule formation. We identified that the p38-Mnk1 cascade regulating phosphorylation of eIF4E is a target of DENV infection and plays an important role in virus production. Our results define several molecular interfaces by which flaviviruses hijack host cell translation and interfere with stress responses to optimize the production of new virus particles.

JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 11
AB  - Flaviviruses are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses and major human pathogens. They are responsible for causing outbreaks and therefore they represent a serious health issue worldwide (1). Because of the clinical significance of flaviviruses and the severity of epidemics they cause globally, developing efficient vaccines and drugs is critical for the success of disease control measures. Importantly, many flaviviruses, including Dengue virus (DENV), Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Yellow Fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), are vectored though arthropods (arboviruses), mainly mosquitoes and ticks (2). Although most previous efforts have primarily focused on advancing the design of therapeutic strategies for alleviating the disease symptoms caused by flaviviruses, it is equally significant to also be able to interpret the molecular nature of the interactions that take place between flaviviruses and the insect vector and determine whether these interactions affect pathophysiological processes during infection and transmission. Interactions between mosquito vectors and flaviviruses have been studied in several occasions (3). For instance, ZIKV is mainly transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and recent studies have begun to examine vector-virus relationships and transmission dynamics of this virus pathogen (4). Ae. aegypti mosquitoes infected with ZIKV activate the RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism by upregulating several virus-produced short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs and microRNAs. Many of the latter are also regulated by DENV and WNVs, but not by the alphavirus Chikungunya, indicating conservation in the mosquito response to flavivirus infection (5). Flavivirus infection in mosquito vectors activates innate immune signaling, which promotes the induction of antiviral response through the production of effector molecules (6). Activation of JAK/ STAT together with Toll signaling elevates the Ae. aegypti resistance to ZIKV infection, silencing the Toll pathway adaptor MyD88 increases DENV infection in the Ae. aegypti midgut, and DENV infection in this mosquito vector decreases the signaling activity of immune deficiency (Imd) pathway (7–9). Interestingly, the secreted protein Vago limits WNV replication in Culex mosquito cells through induction of JAK/STAT signaling (10). Studies in mosquitoes are expected to contribute toward developing efficient procedures for preventing the spread of flaviviruses. Results from research with insect vectors further stress the need for insect immunologists studying antiviral immunity to draw more attention to the outcome of flavivirus infection in insects rather than focusing exclusively on the replication efficacy of the virus. Therefore, this opinion article aims at highlighting recent studies that have started to dissect the interaction between

TI  - Flavivirus NS1 Structures Reveal Surfaces for Associations with Membranes and the Immune System
JF  - Science
VL  - 343
SP  - 881
EP  - 885
AB  - Two-Faced Viral Protein Flaviviruses cause human diseases such as West Nile fever and dengue fever. The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has multiple functions in flavivirus biology and is a target for vaccine development. Dimeric NS1 is essential for replication of the viral genome inside host cells, while hexameric NS1 is secreted and plays a role in evasion of the immune system. Akey et al. (p. 881, published online 6 February; see the Perspective by Shi) report crystal structures for full-length glycosylated NS1 from West Nile and dengue viruses. The structures show a hexamer comprised of three dimers. The structural analysis together with liposome and mutational studies identify a membrane interacting surface on one face of the dimer and an immune evasion surface on the other. The structure of a viral protein provides a basis for understanding its function and could guide vaccine development. [Also see Perspective by Shi] Flaviviruses, the human pathogens responsible for dengue fever, West Nile fever, tick-borne encephalitis, and yellow fever, are endemic in tropical and temperate parts of the world. The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) functions in genome replication as an intracellular dimer and in immune system evasion as a secreted hexamer. We report crystal structures for full-length, glycosylated NS1 from West Nile and dengue viruses. The NS1 hexamer in crystal structures is similar to a solution hexamer visualized by single-particle electron microscopy. Recombinant NS1 binds to lipid bilayers and remodels large liposomes into lipoprotein nanoparticles. The NS1 structures reveal distinct domains for membrane association of the dimer and interactions with the immune system and are a basis for elucidating the molecular mechanism of NS1 function.

TI  - Flavivirus NS1 Triggers Tissue-Specific Disassembly of Intercellular Junctions Leading to Barrier Dysfunction and Vascular Leak in a GSK-3β-Dependent Manner
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected cells and contributes to endothelial barrier dysfunction and vascular leak in a tissue-dependent manner. This phenomenon occurs in part via disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) lining the endothelium. Additionally, we and others have shown that soluble DENV NS1 induces disassembly of intercellular junctions (IJCs), a group of cellular proteins critical for maintaining endothelial homeostasis and regulating vascular permeability; however, the specific mechanisms by which NS1 mediates IJC disruption remain unclear. Here, we investigated the relative contribution of five flavivirus NS1 proteins, from dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), and yellow fever (YFV) viruses, to the expression and localization of the intercellular junction proteins β-catenin and VE-cadherin in endothelial cells from human umbilical vein and brain tissues. We found that flavivirus NS1 induced the mislocalization of β-catenin and VE-cadherin in a tissue-dependent manner, reflecting flavivirus disease tropism. Mechanistically, we observed that NS1 treatment of cells triggered internalization of VE-cadherin, likely via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and phosphorylation of β-catenin, part of a canonical IJC remodeling pathway during breakdown of endothelial barriers that activates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Supporting this model, we found that a chemical inhibitor of GSK-3β reduced both NS1-induced permeability of human umbilical vein and brain microvascular endothelial cell monolayers in vitro and vascular leakage in a mouse dorsal intradermal model. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction and identify GSK-3β as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of vascular leakage during severe dengue disease.

TI  - Flavivirus NS1 protein in infected host sera enhances viral acquisition by mosquitoes
JF  - Nature microbiology
VL  - 1
SP  - 16087
EP  - 16087
AB  - The arbovirus life cycle involves viral transfer between a vertebrate host and an arthropod vector, and acquisition of virus from an infected mammalian host by a vector is an essential step in this process. Here, we report that flavivirus nonstructural protein-1 (NS1), which is abundantly secreted into the serum of an infected host, plays a critical role in flavivirus acquisition by mosquitoes. The presence of dengue virus (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis virus NS1s in the blood of infected interferon-α and γ receptor-deficient mice (AG6) facilitated virus acquisition by their native mosquito vectors because the protein enabled the virus to overcome the immune barrier of the mosquito midgut. Active immunization of AG6 mice with a modified DENV NS1 reduced DENV acquisition by mosquitoes and protected mice against a lethal DENV challenge, suggesting that immunization with NS1 could reduce the number of virus-carrying mosquitoes as well as the incidence of flaviviral diseases. Our study demonstrates that flaviviruses utilize NS1 proteins produced during their vertebrate phases to enhance their acquisition by vectors, which might be a result of flavivirus evolution to adapt to multiple host environments.

TI  - Flavivirus NS4A-induced Autophagy Protects Cells against Death and Enhances Virus Replication*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 286
SP  - 22147
EP  - 22159
AB  - Flaviviruses include the most prevalent and medically challenging viruses. Persistent infection with flaviviruses of epithelial cells and hepatocytes that do not undergo cell death is common. Here, we report that, in epithelial cells, up-regulation of autophagy following flavivirus infection markedly enhances virus replication and that one flavivirus gene, NS4A, uniquely determines the up-regulation of autophagy. Dengue-2 and Modoc (a murine flavivirus) kill primary murine macrophages but protect epithelial cells and fibroblasts against death provoked by several insults. The flavivirus-induced protection derives from the up-regulation of autophagy, as up-regulation of autophagy by starvation or inactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin also protects the cells against insult, whereas inhibition of autophagy via inactivation of PI3K nullifies the protection conferred by flavivirus. Inhibition of autophagy also limits replication of both Dengue-2 and Modoc virus in epithelial cells. Expression of flavivirus NS4A is sufficient to induce PI3K-dependent autophagy and to protect cells against death; expression of other viral genes, including NS2A and NS4B, fails to protect cells against several stressors. Flavivirus NS4A protein induces autophagy in epithelial cells and thus protects them from death during infection. As autophagy is vital to flavivirus replication in these cells, NS4A is therefore also identified as a critical determinant of flavivirus replication.

TI  - Flavivirus NS5 associates with host-cell proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis-2 (RIMS2) via an internal PDZ binding mechanism
VL  - 390
SP  - 319
EP  - 323
AB  - Abstract Dengue virus (DENV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are flaviviruses, which can cause lethal hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that the TBEV-NS5 and DENV-NS5 proteins use an internal binding mechanism to target human PDZ proteins. TBEV-NS5 has high affinity to regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis-2 (RIMS2) and Scribble, whereas DENV-NS5 binds primarily to the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Targeting of TBEV-NS5 to the plasma membrane is stabilised by ZO-1; however, DENV-NS5 co-localises with ZO-1 in the nucleus. These interactions have potential important roles in the ability of flaviviruses to manipulate cell proliferation, junction permeability and the interferon pathways.

AB  - Viral infections of the nervous system (NS) can be caused by many types of viruses, including rhabdoviruses, alpha and beta herpes viruses, retroviruses, picornaviruses, arenaviruses and flaviviruses (van den Pol, 2006) The replication of these viruses can occur both in neurons and in non-neuronal cells and each type of cell responds differently (Griffin, 2003). The final result of these infections is the alteration of function of the nervous system.

TI  - Flavivirus Nonstructural Protein NS5 Dysregulates HSP90 to Broadly Inhibit JAK/STAT Signaling
JF  - Cells
VL  - 9
AB  - Pathogenic flaviviruses antagonize host cell Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling downstream of interferons α/β. Here, we show that flaviviruses inhibit JAK/STAT signaling induced by a wide range of cytokines beyond interferon, including interleukins. This broad inhibition was mapped to viral nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) binding to cellular heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), resulting in reduced Janus kinase–HSP90 interaction and thus destabilization of unchaperoned JAKs (and other kinase clients) of HSP90 during infection by Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. Our studies implicate viral dysregulation of HSP90 and the JAK/STAT pathway as a critical determinant of cytokine signaling control during flavivirus infection.

TI  - Flavivirus RNA methylation.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 95 Pt 4
SP  - 763
EP  - 78
AB  - The 5' end of eukaryotic mRNA contains the type-1 (m7GpppNm) or type-2 (m7GpppNmNm) cap structure. Many viruses have evolved various mechanisms to develop their own capping enzymes (e.g. flavivirus and coronavirus) or to 'steal' caps from host mRNAs (e.g. influenza virus). Other viruses have developed 'cap-mimicking' mechanisms by attaching a peptide to the 5' end of viral RNA (e.g. picornavirus and calicivirus) or by having a complex 5' RNA structure (internal ribosome entry site) for translation initiation (e.g. picornavirus, pestivirus and hepacivirus). Here we review the diverse viral RNA capping mechanisms. Using flavivirus as a model, we summarize how a single methyltransferase catalyses two distinct N-7 and 2'-O methylations of viral RNA cap in a sequential manner. For antiviral development, a structural feature unique to the flavivirus methyltransferase was successfully used to design selective inhibitors that block viral methyltransferase without affecting host methyltransferases. Functionally, capping is essential for prevention of triphosphate-triggered innate immune activation; N-7 methylation is critical for enhancement of viral translation; and 2'-O methylation is important for subversion of innate immune response during viral infection. Flaviviruses defective in 2'-O methyltransferase are replicative, but their viral RNAs lack 2'-O methylation and are recognized and eliminated by the host immune response. Such mutant viruses could be rationally designed as live attenuated vaccines. This concept has recently been proved with Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue virus. The findings obtained with flavivirus should be applicable to other RNA viruses.

TI  - Flavivirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Interacts with Genome UTRs and Viral Proteins to Facilitate Flavivirus RNA Replication
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - Flaviviruses, most of which are emerging and re-emerging human pathogens and significant public health concerns worldwide, are positive-sense RNA viruses. Flavivirus replication occurs on the ER and is regulated by many mechanisms and factors. NS5, which consists of a C-terminal RdRp domain and an N-terminal methyltransferase domain, plays a pivotal role in genome replication and capping. The C-terminal RdRp domain acts as the polymerase for RNA synthesis and cooperates with diverse viral proteins to facilitate productive RNA proliferation within the replication complex. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of the functions and characteristics of the RdRp, including the subcellular localization of NS5, as well as the network of interactions formed between the RdRp and genome UTRs, NS3, and the methyltransferase domain. We posit that a detailed understanding of RdRp functions may provide a target for antiviral drug discovery and therapeutics.

The genus comprises more than seventy small, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, which are responsible for a spectrum of human and animal diseases ranging in symptoms from mild, influenza-like infection to fatal encephalitis and haemorrhagic fever. Despite genomic and structural similarities across the genus, infections by different flaviviruses result in disparate clinical presentations. This review focusses on two haemorrhagic flaviviruses, dengue virus and yellow fever virus, and two neurotropic flaviviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus and Zika virus. We review current knowledge on host-pathogen interactions, virus entry strategies and tropism.

TI  - Flavivirus Replication Organelle Biogenesis in the Endoplasmic Reticulum: Comparison with Other Single-Stranded Positive-Sense RNA Viruses
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 20
AB  - Some single-stranded positive-sense RNA [ssRNA(+)] viruses, including Flavivirus, generate specific organelle-like structures in the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These structures are called virus replication organelles and consist of two distinct subdomains, the vesicle packets (VPs) and the convoluted membranes (CMs). The VPs are clusters of small vesicle compartments and are considered to be the site of viral genome replication. The CMs are electron-dense amorphous structures observed in proximity to the VPs, but the exact roles of CMs are mostly unknown. Several recent studies have revealed that flaviviruses recruit several host factors that are usually used for the biogenesis of other conventional organelles and usurp their function to generate virus replication organelles. In the current review, we summarize recent studies focusing on the role of host factors in the formation of virus replication organelles and discuss how these intricate membrane structures are organized.

TI  - Flavivirus induces and antagonizes antiviral RNA interference in both mammals and mosquitoes
JF  - Science Advances
VL  - 6
AB  - Flaviviruses such as dengue use the same strategy to evade RNAi-based intrinsic antiviral defenses in both mammals and mosquitoes. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses infect both mammals and mosquitoes. RNA interference (RNAi) has been demonstrated as an anti-flavivirus mechanism in mosquitoes; however, whether and how flaviviruses induce and antagonize RNAi-mediated antiviral immunity in mammals remains unknown. We show that the nonstructural protein NS2A of dengue virus-2 (DENV2) act as a viral suppressor of RNAi (VSR). When NS2A-mediated RNAi suppression was disabled, the resulting mutant DENV2 induced Dicer-dependent production of abundant DENV2-derived siRNAs in differentiated mammalian cells. VSR-disabled DENV2 showed severe replication defects in mosquito and mammalian cells and in mice that were rescued by RNAi deficiency. Moreover, NS2As of multiple flaviviruses act as VSRs in vitro and during viral infection in both organisms. Overall, our findings demonstrate that antiviral RNAi can be induced by flavivirus, while flavivirus uses NS2A as a bona fide VSR to evade RNAi in mammals and mosquitoes, highlighting the importance of RNAi in flaviviral vector-host life cycles.

TI  - Flavivirus infections induce a Golgi stress response in vertebrate and mosquito cells
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 11
AB  - The stress of the Golgi apparatus is an autoregulatory mechanism that is induced to compensate for greater demand in the Golgi functions. No examples of Golgi stress responses due to physiological stimuli are known. Furthermore, the impact on this organelle of viral infections that occupy the vesicular transport during replication is unknown. In this work, we evaluated if a Golgi stress response is triggered during dengue and Zika viruses replication, two flaviviruses whose replicative cycle is heavily involved with the Golgi complex, in vertebrate and mosquito cells. Using GM-130 as a Golgi marker, and treatment with monensin as a positive control for the induction of the Golgi stress response, a significant expansion of the Golgi cisternae was observed in BHK-21, Vero E6 and mosquito cells infected with either virus. Activation of the TFE3 pathway was observed in the infected cells as indicated by the translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of TFE3 and increased expression of pathway targeted genes. Of note, no sign of activation of the stress response was observed in CRFK cells infected with Feline Calicivirus (FCV), a virus released by cell lysis, not requiring vesicular transport. Finally, dilatation of the Golgi complex and translocation of TFE3 was observed in vertebrate cells expressing dengue and Zika viruses NS1, but not NS3. These results indicated that infections by dengue and Zika viruses induce a Golgi stress response in vertebrate and mosquito cells due to the increased demand on the Golgi complex imposed by virion and NS1 processing and secretion.

TI  - Flavivirus internalization is regulated by a size-dependent endocytic pathway
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 115
SP  - 4246
EP  - 4251
AB  - Significance Flaviviruses are a globally important group of human viral pathogens. These viruses enter cells by hijacking an endocytic pathway, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, used by cells to take up growth factors and nutrients. While most cargo is small, virions are large, and we identified host factors specifically required for the internalization of large cargo including these viruses. These studies define a set of requirements for viral internalization and which may be amenable to therapeutic interventions. Flaviviruses enter host cells through the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the spectrum of host factors required for this process are incompletely understood. Here we found that lymphocyte antigen 6 locus E (LY6E) promotes the internalization of multiple flaviviruses, including West Nile virus, Zika virus, and dengue virus. Perhaps surprisingly, LY6E is dispensable for the internalization of the endogenous cargo transferrin, which is also dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis for uptake. Since viruses are substantially larger than transferrin, we reasoned that LY6E may be required for uptake of larger cargoes and tested this using transferrin-coated beads of similar size as flaviviruses. LY6E was indeed required for the internalization of transferrin-coated beads, suggesting that LY6E is selectively required for large cargo. Cell biological studies found that LY6E forms tubules upon viral infection and bead internalization, and we found that tubule formation was dependent on RNASEK, which is also required for flavivirus internalization, but not transferrin uptake. Indeed, we found that RNASEK is also required for the internalization of transferrin-coated beads, suggesting it functions upstream of LY6E. These LY6E tubules resembled microtubules, and we found that microtubule assembly was required for their formation and flavivirus uptake. Since microtubule end-binding proteins link microtubules to downstream activities, we screened the three end-binding proteins and found that EB3 promotes virus uptake and LY6E tubularization. Taken together, these results highlight a specialized pathway required for the uptake of large clathrin-dependent endocytosis cargoes, including flaviviruses.

TI  - Flavivirus prM interacts with MDA5 and MAVS to inhibit RLR antiviral signaling
JF  - Cell & Bioscience
VL  - 13
AB  - Background Vector-borne flaviviruses, including tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), pose a growing threat to public health worldwide, and have evolved complex mechanisms to overcome host antiviral innate immunity. However, the underlying mechanisms of flavivirus structural proteins to evade host immune response remain elusive. Results We showed that TBEV structural protein, pre-membrane (prM) protein, could inhibit type I interferon (IFN-I) production. Mechanically, TBEV prM interacted with both MDA5 and MAVS and interfered with the formation of MDA5-MAVS complex, thereby impeding the nuclear translocation and dimerization of IRF3 to inhibit RLR antiviral signaling. ZIKV and WNV prM was also demonstrated to interact with both MDA5 and MAVS, while dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) and YFV prM associated only with MDA5 or MAVS to suppress IFN-I production. In contrast, JEV prM could not suppress IFN-I production. Overexpression of TBEV and ZIKV prM significantly promoted the replication of TBEV and Sendai virus. Conclusion Our findings reveal the immune evasion mechanisms of flavivirus prM, which may contribute to understanding flavivirus pathogenicity, therapeutic intervention and vaccine development.

TI  - Flaviviruses Are Sensitive to Inhibition of Thymidine Synthesis Pathways
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 9411
EP  - 9419
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus has emerged as a global health threat to over one-third of humankind. As a positive-strand RNA virus, dengue virus relies on the host cell metabolism for its translation, replication, and egress. Therefore, a better understanding of the host cell metabolic pathways required for dengue virus infection offers the opportunity to develop new approaches for therapeutic intervention. In a recently described screen of known drugs and bioactive molecules, we observed that methotrexate and floxuridine inhibited dengue virus infections at low micromolar concentrations. Here, we demonstrate that all serotypes of dengue virus, as well as West Nile virus, are highly sensitive to both methotrexate and floxuridine, whereas other RNA viruses (Sindbis virus and vesicular stomatitis virus) are not. Interestingly, flavivirus replication was restored by folinic acid, a thymidine precursor, in the presence of methotrexate and by thymidine in the presence of floxuridine, suggesting an unexpected role for thymidine in flavivirus replication. Since thymidine is not incorporated into RNA genomes, it is likely that increased thymidine production is indirectly involved in flavivirus replication. A possible mechanism is suggested by the finding that p53 inhibition restored dengue virus replication in the presence of floxuridine, consistent with thymidine-less stress triggering p53-mediated antiflavivirus effects in infected cells. Our data reveal thymidine synthesis pathways as new and unexpected therapeutic targets for antiflaviviral drug development.

TI  - Flaviviruses Induce Pro-inflammatory and Anti-inflammatory Cytokines from Murine Dendritic Cells through MyD88-dependent Pathway
JF  - Immune Network
VL  - 7
SP  - 66
EP  - 74
AB  - The genus Flavivirus consists of many emerging arboviruses, including Dengue virus (DV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV). Effective preventive vaccines remain elusive for these diseases. Mice are being increasingly used as the animal model for vaccine studies. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of these viruses are not clearly understood. Here, we investigated the interaction of DV and JEV with murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (bmDC). Methods: ELISA and FACS analysis were employed to investigate cytokine production and phenotypic changes of DCs obtained from bone marrow following flavivirus infection. Results: We observed that these viruses altered the cytokine profile and phenotypic markers. Although both viruses belong to the same family, JEV-infected bmDC produced anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) along with pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas DV infection induced production of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) and no IL-10 from murine bmDCs. Both flaviviruses also up-regulated the expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40, CD80 and CD86. JEV infection led to down-regulation of MHC II expression on infected bmDCs. We also found that cytokine production induced by JEV and DV is MyD88-dependent. This dependence was complete for DV, as cytokine production was completely abolished in the absence of MyD88. With regard to JEV, the absence of MyD88 led to a partial reduction in cytokine levels. Conclusion: Here, we demonstrate that MyD88 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of flaviviruses. Our study provides insight into the pathogenesis of JEV and DV in the murine model.

TI  - Flaviviruses and the Central Nervous System: Revisiting Neuropathological Concepts.
JF  - Annual review of virology
VL  - 5 1
SP  - 255
EP  - 272
AB  - Flaviviruses are major emerging human pathogens on a global scale. Some flaviviruses can infect the central nervous system of the host and therefore are regarded as neurotropic. The most clinically relevant classical neurotropic flaviviruses include Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. In this review, we focus on these flaviviruses and revisit the concepts of flaviviral neurotropism, neuropathogenicity, neuroinvasion, and resultant neuropathogenesis. We attempt to synthesize the current knowledge about interactions between the central nervous system and flaviviruses from the neuroanatomical and neuropathological perspectives and address some misconceptions and controversies. We hope that revisiting these neuropathological concepts will improve the understanding of flaviviral neuroinfections. This, in turn, may provide further guiding foundations for relevant studies of other emerging or geographically expanding flaviviruses with neuropathogenic potential, such as Zika virus and dengue virus, and pave the way for intelligent therapeutic strategies harnessing potentially beneficial, protective host responses to interfere with disease progression and outcome.

TI  - Flaviviruses: Innate Immunity, Inflammasome Activation, Inflammatory Cell Death, and Cytokines
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 13
AB  - The innate immune system is the host’s first line of defense against the invasion of pathogens including flavivirus. The programmed cell death controlled by genes plays an irreplaceable role in resisting pathogen invasion and preventing pathogen infection. However, the inflammatory cell death, which can trigger the overflow of a large number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell contents, will initiate a severe inflammatory response. In this review, we summarized the current understanding of the innate immune response, inflammatory cell death pathway and cytokine secretion regulation during Dengue virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and other flavivirus infections. We also discussed the impact of these flavivirus and viral proteins on these biological processes. This not only provides a scientific basis for elucidating the pathogenesis of flavivirus, but also lays the foundation for the development of effective antiviral therapies.

TI  - Flavors of Flaviviral RNA Structure: towards an Integrated View of RNA Function from Translation through Encapsidation
JF  - Bioessays
VL  - 41
AB  - For many viruses, RNA is the holder of genetic information and serves as the template for both replication and translation. While host and viral proteins play important roles in viral decision‐making, the extent to which viral RNA (vRNA) actively participates in translation and replication might be surprising. Here, the focus is on flaviviruses, which include common human scourges such as dengue, West Nile, and Zika viruses, from an RNA‐centric viewpoint. In reviewing more recent findings, an attempt is made to fill knowledge gaps and revisit some canonical views of vRNA structures involved in replication. In particular, alternative views are offered on the nature of the flaviviral promoter and genome cyclization, and the feasibility of refining in vitro‐derived models with modern RNA probing and sequencing methods is pointed out. By tracing vRNA structures from translation through encapsidation, a dynamic molecule closely involved in the self‐regulation of viral replication is revealed.

TI  - Flexibility between the Protease and Helicase Domains of the Dengue Virus NS3 Protein Conferred by the Linker Region and Its Functional Implications
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 285
SP  - 18817
EP  - 18827
AB  - The dengue virus (DENV) NS3 protein is essential for viral polyprotein processing and RNA replication. It contains an N-terminal serine protease region (residues 1–168) joined to an RNA helicase (residues 180–618) by an 11-amino acid linker (169–179). The structure at 3.15 Å of the soluble NS3 protein from DENV4 covalently attached to 18 residues of the NS2B cofactor region (NS2B18NS3) revealed an elongated molecule with the protease domain abutting subdomains I and II of the helicase (Luo, D., Xu, T., Hunke, C., Grüber, G., Vasudevan, S. G., and Lescar, J. (2008) J. Virol. 82, 173–183). Unexpectedly, using similar crystal growth conditions, we observed an alternative conformation where the protease domain has rotated by ∼161° with respect to the helicase domain. We report this new crystal structure bound to ADP-Mn2+ refined to a resolution of 2.2 Å. The biological significance for interdomain flexibility conferred by the linker region was probed by either inserting a Gly residue between Glu173 and Pro174 or replacing Pro174 with a Gly residue. Both mutations resulted in significantly lower ATPase and helicase activities. We next increased flexibility in the linker by introducing a Pro176 to Gly mutation in a DENV2 replicon system. A 70% reduction in luciferase reporter signal and a similar reduction in the level of viral RNA synthesis were observed. Our results indicate that the linker region has evolved to an optimum length to confer flexibility to the NS3 protein that is required both for polyprotein processing and RNA replication.

AB  - ABSTRACT We examined the function of the conserved Val/Ile residue within the dengue virus NS5 interdomain linker (residues 263 to 272) by site-directed mutagenesis. Gly substitution or Gly/Pro insertion after the conserved residue increased the linker flexibility and created slightly attenuated viruses. In contrast, Pro substitution abolished virus replication by imposing rigidity in the linker and restricting NS5's conformational plasticity. Our biochemical and reverse genetics experiments demonstrate that NS5 utilizes conformational regulation to achieve optimum viral replication.

TI  - Flying under the radar – impact and factors influencing asymptomatic DENV infections
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - The clinical outcome of DENV and other Flaviviruses infections represents a spectrum of severity that ranges from mild manifestations to severe disease, which can ultimately lead to death. Nonetheless, most of these infections result in an asymptomatic outcome that may play an important role in the persistent circulation of these viruses. Also, although little is known about the mechanisms that lead to these asymptomatic infections, they are likely the result of a complex interplay between viral and host factors. Specific characteristics of the infecting viral strain, such as its replicating efficiency, coupled with host factors, like gene expression of key molecules involved in the immune response or in the protection against disease, are among crucial factors to study. This review revisits recent data on factors that may contribute to the asymptomatic outcome of the world’s widespread DENV, highlighting the importance of silent infections in the transmission of this pathogen and the immune status of the host.

TI  - Full-genome dengue virus sequencing in mosquito saliva shows lack of convergent positive selection during transmission by Aedes aegypti
JF  - Virus Evolution
VL  - 3
AB  - Abstract Like other pathogens with high mutation and replication rates, within-host dengue virus (DENV) populations evolve during infection of their main mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. Within-host DENV evolution during transmission provides opportunities for adaptation and emergence of novel virus variants. Recent studies of DENV genetic diversity failed to detect convergent evolution of adaptive mutations in mosquito tissues such as midgut and salivary glands, suggesting that convergent positive selection is not a major driver of within-host DENV evolution in the vector. However, it is unknown whether this conclusion extends to the transmitted viral subpopulation because it is technically difficult to sequence DENV genomes in mosquito saliva. Here, we achieved DENV full-genome sequencing by pooling saliva samples collected non-sacrificially from 49 to 163 individual Ae. aegypti mosquitoes previously infected with one of two DENV-1 genotypes. We compared the transmitted viral subpopulations found in the pooled saliva samples collected in time series with the input viral population present in the infectious blood meal. In all pooled saliva samples examined, the full-genome consensus sequence of the input viral population was unchanged. Although the pooling strategy prevents analysis of individual saliva samples, our results demonstrate the lack of strong convergent positive selection during a single round of DENV transmission by Ae. aegypti. This finding reinforces the idea that genetic drift and purifying selection are the dominant evolutionary forces shaping within-host DENV genetic diversity during transmission by mosquitoes.

EP  - 33108
AB  - Fundamental aspects of interactions of the Dengue virus type 3 full-length polymerase with the single-stranded and double-stranded RNA and DNA have been quantitatively addressed. The polymerase exists as a monomer with an elongated shape in solution. In the absence of magnesium, the total site size of the polymerase-ssRNA complex is 26 ± 2 nucleotides. In the presence of Mg2+, the site size increases to 29 ± 2 nucleotides, indicating that magnesium affects the enzyme global conformation. The enzyme shows a preference for the homopyrimidine ssRNAs. Positive cooperativity in the binding to homopurine ssRNAs indicates that the type of nucleic acid base dramatically affects the enzyme orientation in the complex. Both the intrinsic affinity and the cooperative interactions are accompanied by a net ion release. The polymerase binds the dsDNA with an affinity comparable with the ssRNAs affinity, indicating that the binding site has an open conformation in solution. The lack of detectable dsRNA or dsRNA-DNA hybrid affinities indicates that the entry to the binding site is specific for the sugar-phosphate backbone and/or conformation of the duplex.

EP  - 14372
AB  - Flavivirus NS5 protein encodes methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities. Structural analysis of flavivirus RdRp domains uncovered two conserved cavities (A and B). Both cavities are located in the thumb subdomains and represent potential targets for development of allosteric inhibitors. In this study, we used dengue virus as a model to analyze the function of the two RdRp cavities. Amino acids from both cavities were subjected to mutagenesis analysis in the context of genome-length RNA and recombinant NS5 protein; residues critical for viral replication were subjected to revertant analysis. For cavity A, we found that only one (Lys-756) of the seven selected amino acids is critical for viral replication. Alanine substitution of Lys-756 did not affect the RdRp activity, suggesting that this residue functions through a nonenzymatic mechanism. For cavity B, all four selected amino acids (Leu-328, Lys-330, Trp-859, and Ile-863) are critical for viral replication. Biochemical and revertant analyses showed that three of the four mutated residues (Leu-328, Trp-859, and Ile-863) function at the step of initiation of RNA synthesis, whereas the fourth residue (Lys-330) functions by interacting with the viral NS3 helicase domain. Collectively, our results have provided direct evidence for the hypothesis that cavity B, but not cavity A, from dengue virus NS5 polymerase could be a target for rational drug design.

TI  - Functional Information Stored in the Conserved Structural RNA Domains of Flavivirus Genomes
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - The genus Flavivirus comprises a large number of small, positive-sense single-stranded, RNA viruses able to replicate in the cytoplasm of certain arthropod and/or vertebrate host cells. The genus, which has some 70 member species, includes a number of emerging and re-emerging pathogens responsible for outbreaks of human disease around the world, such as the West Nile, dengue, Zika, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Like other RNA viruses, flaviviruses have a compact RNA genome that efficiently stores all the information required for the completion of the infectious cycle. The efficiency of this storage system is attributable to supracoding elements, i.e., discrete, structural units with essential functions. This information storage system overlaps and complements the protein coding sequence and is highly conserved across the genus. It therefore offers interesting potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes our knowledge of the features of flavivirus genome functional RNA domains. It also provides a brief overview of the main achievements reported in the design of antiviral nucleic acid-based drugs targeting functional genomic RNA elements.

TI  - Functional Profiling of Recombinant NS3 Proteases from All Four Serotypes of Dengue Virus Using Tetrapeptide and Octapeptide Substrate Libraries*[boxs]
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 280
SP  - 28766
EP  - 28774
AB  - Regulated proteolysis by the two-component NS2B/NS3 protease of dengue virus is essential for virus replication and the maturation of infectious virions. The functional similarity between the NS2B/NS3 proteases from the four genetically and antigenically distinct serotypes was addressed by characterizing the differences in their substrate specificity using tetrapeptide and octapeptide libraries in a positional scanning format, each containing 130,321 substrates. The proteases from different serotypes were shown to be functionally homologous based on the similarity of their substrate cleavage preferences. A strong preference for basic amino acid residues (Arg/Lys) at the P1 positions was observed, whereas the preferences for the P2-4 sites were in the order of Arg > Thr > Gln/Asn/Lys for P2, Lys > Arg > Asn for P3, and Nle > Leu > Lys > Xaa for P4. The prime site substrate specificity was for small and polar amino acids in P1′ and P3′. In contrast, the P2′ and P4′ substrate positions showed minimal activity. The influence of the P2 and P3 amino acids on ground state binding and the P4 position for transition state stabilization was identified through single substrate kinetics with optimal and suboptimal substrate sequences. The specificities observed for dengue NS2B/NS3 have features in common with the physiological cleavage sites in the dengue polyprotein; however, all sites reveal previously unrecognized suboptimal sequences.

TI  - Functional RNA Elements in the Dengue Virus Genome
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 3
SP  - 1739
EP  - 1756
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) genome amplification is a process that involves the viral RNA, cellular and viral proteins, and a complex architecture of cellular membranes. The viral RNA is not a passive template during this process; it plays an active role providing RNA signals that act as promoters, enhancers and/or silencers of the replication process. RNA elements that modulate RNA replication were found at the 5′ and 3′ UTRs and within the viral coding sequence. The promoter for DENV RNA synthesis is a large stem loop structure located at the 5′ end of the genome. This structure specifically interacts with the viral polymerase NS5 and promotes RNA synthesis at the 3′ end of a circularized genome. The circular conformation of the viral genome is mediated by long range RNA-RNA interactions that span thousands of nucleotides. Recent studies have provided new information about the requirement of alternative, mutually exclusive, structures in the viral RNA, highlighting the idea that the viral genome is flexible and exists in different conformations. In this article, we describe elements in the promoter SLA and other RNA signals involved in NS5 polymerase binding and activity, and provide new ideas of how dynamic secondary and tertiary structures of the viral RNA participate in the viral life cycle.

TI  - Functional Roles and Host Interactions of Orthoflavivirus Non-Structural Proteins During Replication
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - Orthoflavivirus, a genus encompassing arthropod-borne, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses in the Flaviviridae family, represents clinically relevant viruses that pose significant threats to human and animal health worldwide. With warming climates and persistent urbanization, arthropod vectors and the viruses they transmit continue to widen their geographic distribution, expanding endemic zones. Flaviviruses such as dengue virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus cause debilitating and fatal infections globally. In 2024, the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization declared the current dengue situation a Multi-Country Grade 3 Outbreak, the highest level. FDA-approved treatment options for diseases caused by flaviviruses are limited or non-existent, and vaccines are suboptimal for many flaviviruses. Understanding the molecular characteristics of the flavivirus life cycle, virus-host interactions, and resulting pathogenesis in various cells and model systems is critical for developing effective therapeutic intervention strategies. This review will focus on the virus-host interactions of mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses from the virus replication and assembly perspective, emphasizing the interplay between viral non-structural proteins and host pathways that are hijacked for their advantage. Highlighting interaction pathways, including innate immunity, intracellular movement, and membrane modification, emphasizes the need for rigorous and targeted antiviral research and development against these re-emerging viruses.

TI  - Functional Verification of Differentially Expressed Genes Following DENV2 Infection in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 17
AB  - The dengue virus (DENV) is primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti. Investigating genes associated with mosquito susceptibility to DENV2 offers a theoretical foundation for targeted interventions to regulate or block viral replication and transmission within mosquitoes. Based on the transcriptomic analyses of the midgut and salivary glands from Aedes aegypti infected with DENV2, alongside analyses of Aag2 cell infections, 24 genes potentially related to the regulation of Aedes aegypti infection with DENV2 were selected. By establishing transient transfection and overexpression models of Aedes aegypti Aag2 cells, and mosquito target gene interference models, the difference in viral load before and after treatment was compared, and the effects of DEGs on viral replication were evaluated. After overexpressing 24 DEGs in Aag2 cells, 19 DEGs showed a significant difference in DENV2 RNA copies in the cell supernatant (p < 0.05). In adult mosquitoes, knocking down defensin-A, defensin-A-like, and SMCT1 respectively reduced the DENV2 RNA copies, while knocking down UGT2B1 and ND4 respectively increased the DENV2 RNA copies. In this study, to assess the role of genes related to DENV2 replication, and transient transfection and overexpression models in Aag2 cells and mosquito gene knockdown models were established, and five genes, defensin-A, defensin-A-like, SMCT1, UGT2B1, and ND4, were found to have an impact on the replication of DENV2, providing a reference basis for studying the complex mechanism of mosquito–virus interactions.

TI  - Functional analysis of flavivirus replicase by deep mutational scanning of dengue NS5
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Flavivirus NS5 is multi-functional viral protein that play critical roles in virus replication, evolution, and immune antagonism against the hosts. Its error-prone replicase activity copies viral RNA for progeny virus particles and shapes virus evolution. Its methyltransferase activity and STAT2-targeting activity compromise type-I interferon signalling, dampening protective immune response during infection. It interacts with several host factors to shape the host-cell environment for virus replication. Thus, NS5 represents a critical target for both vaccine and antiviral drug development. Here, we performed deep mutational scanning (DMS) on the NS5 of dengue virus serotype 2 in mammalian cells. In combination with available structural and biochemical data, the comprehensive single amino-acid mutational data corroborated key residues and interactions involved in enzymatic functions of the replicase and suggested potential plasticity in NS5 guanylyl transferase. Strikingly, we identified that a set of strictly conserved residues in the motifs lining the replicase active site could tolerate mutations, suggesting additional roles of the priming loop in viral RNA synthesis and possible strategies to modulate the error rate of viral replicase activity through active-site engineering. Our DMS dataset and NS5 libraries could provide a framework and a resource to investigate molecular, evolutionary, and immunological aspects of NS5 functions, with relevance to vaccine and antiviral drug development.

VL  - 89 Pt 2
SP  - 474
EP  - 84
AB  - Entry of dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) into Aedes albopictus mosquito C6/36 cells was analysed using biochemical and molecular inhibitors, together with confocal and electron microscopy observations. Treatment with monodansylcadaverine, chlorpromazine, sucrose and ammonium chloride inhibited DENV-2 virus yield and protein expression, whereas nystatin, a blocker of caveolae-mediated endocytosis, did not have any effect. Using confocal microscopy, co-localization of DENV-2 E glycoprotein and the marker protein transferrin was observed at the periphery of the cytoplasm. To support the requirement of clathrin function for DENV-2 entry, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of Eps15 in C6/36 cells was shown to impair virus entry. The disruption of actin microfilaments by cytochalasin D also significantly affected DENV-2 replication. In contrast, microtubule disruption by colchicine treatment did not impair DENV-2 infectivity, suggesting that DENV-2 does not require transport from early to late endosomes for successful infection of mosquito cells. Furthermore, using transmission electron microscopy, DENV-2 particles of approximately 44-52 nm were found attached within electron-dense invaginations of the plasma membrane and in coated vesicles that resembled those of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, respectively. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that DENV-2 enters insect cells by receptor-mediated, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, requiring traffic through an acidic pH compartment for subsequent uncoating and completion of a productive infection.

TI  - Functional importance of dengue virus maturation: infectious properties of immature virions.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 89 Pt 12
SP  - 3047
EP  - 51
AB  - Prior to the release of flavivirus particles from infected cells, the viral surface protein prM is cleaved to M by the cellular enzyme furin. For dengue virus (DENV), this maturation process appears to be very inefficient since a high proportion of progeny virions contain uncleaved prM. Furthermore, it has been reported that prM-containing DENV particles are infectious. These observations contradict the general assumption that prM processing is required to render virus particles infectious. Therefore, in this study, we reinvestigated the infectious properties of immature DENV virions. DENV particles were produced in furin-deficient LoVo cells. We observed that DENV-infected LoVo cells secrete high numbers of prM-containing particles. Subsequent analysis of the infectious titre revealed that immature particles lack the ability to infect cells, the infectious unit to particle ratio being 10 000-fold reduced compared with that of wild-type virus. Our results indicate that cleavage of prM to M is required for DENV infectivity.

SP  - 796
EP  - 806
AB  - Host factors interacting with the dengue virus (DENV) 3' UTR are involved in virus replication, but their roles remain poorly understood. We used RNA affinity capture and mass spectrometry to identify p100 as a host cellular protein associated with the DENV 3' UTR. By using RNA immunoprecipitation and confocal immunofluorescence analysis we demonstrated an interaction between p100 and the 3' UTR in DENV-infected cells. We identified the A4 region (the extensive stem-loop structure at the 3' end) as the binding site of p100 by studying deletion mutants. p100 knockdown specifically reduced the levels of viral RNA and viral protein in DENV-infected cells. Furthermore, downregulation of p100 reduced the expression of a heterologously expressed luciferase-3' UTR(DENV) mRNA in an A4-dependent manner, confirming the binding data and the effects of p100 knockdown on viral replication. These results provide evidence that p100 interacts with the 3' UTR of DENV and is required for normal DENV replication.

The demonstration of such a mechanism for three flaviviruses suggests that vertical transmission of all mosquito-borne flaviviruses may occur in the same manner.

JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 6
AB  - Flaviviruses cause a wide range of severe diseases ranging from encephalitis to hemorrhagic fever. Discovery of host factors that regulate the fate of flaviviruses in infected cells could provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of infection and therefore facilitate the development of anti-flaviviral drugs. We performed genome-scale siRNA screens to discover human host factors required for yellow fever virus (YFV) propagation. Using a 2×2 siRNA pool screening format and a duplicate of the screen, we identified a high confidence list of YFV host factors. To find commonalities between flaviviruses, these candidates were compared to host factors previously identified for West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV). This comparison highlighted a potential requirement for the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family, GRKs, for flaviviral infection. The YFV host candidate GRK2 (also known as ADRBK1) was validated both in siRNA-mediated knockdown HuH-7 cells and in GRK−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Additionally, we showed that GRK2 was required for efficient propagation of DENV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) indicating that GRK2 requirement is conserved throughout the Flaviviridae. Finally, we found that GRK2 participates in multiple distinct steps of the flavivirus life cycle by promoting both entry and RNA synthesis. Together, our findings identified GRK2 as a novel regulator of flavivirus infection and suggest that inhibition of GRK2 function may constitute a new approach for treatment of flavivirus associated diseases.

TI  - G3BP1, G3BP2 and CAPRIN1 Are Required for Translation of Interferon Stimulated mRNAs and Are Targeted by a Dengue Virus Non-coding RNA
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 10
AB  - Viral RNA-host protein interactions are critical for replication of flaviviruses, a genus of positive-strand RNA viruses comprising major vector-borne human pathogens including dengue viruses (DENV). We examined three conserved host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) G3BP1, G3BP2 and CAPRIN1 in dengue virus (DENV-2) infection and found them to be novel regulators of the interferon (IFN) response against DENV-2. The three RBPs were required for the accumulation of the protein products of several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), and for efficient translation of PKR and IFITM2 mRNAs. This identifies G3BP1, G3BP2 and CAPRIN1 as novel regulators of the antiviral state. Their antiviral activity was antagonized by the abundant DENV-2 non-coding subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA), which bound to G3BP1, G3BP2 and CAPRIN1, inhibited their activity and lead to profound inhibition of ISG mRNA translation. This work describes a new and unexpected level of regulation for interferon stimulated gene expression and presents the first mechanism of action for an sfRNA as a molecular sponge of anti-viral effectors in human cells.

TI  - Galectin-1 Exerts Inhibitory Effects during DENV-1 Infection
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped RNA virus that is mosquito-transmitted and can infect a variety of immune and non-immune cells. Response to infection ranges from asymptomatic disease to a severe disorder known as dengue hemorrhagic fever. Despite efforts to control the disease, there are no effective treatments or vaccines. In our search for new antiviral compounds to combat infection by dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1), we investigated the role of galectin-1, a widely-expressed mammalian lectin with functions in cell-pathogen interactions and immunoregulatory properties. We found that DENV-1 infection of cells in vitro exhibited caused decreased expression of Gal-1 in several different human cell lines, suggesting that loss of Gal-1 is associated with virus production. In test of this hypothesis we found that exogenous addition of human recombinant Gal-1 (hrGal-1) inhibits the virus production in the three different cell types. This inhibitory effect was dependent on hrGal-1 dimerization and required its carbohydrate recognition domain. Importantly, the inhibition was specific for hrGal-1, since no effect was observed using recombinant human galectin-3. Interestingly, we found that hrGal-1 directly binds to dengue virus and acts, at least in part, during the early stages of DENV-1 infection, by inhibiting viral adsorption and its internalization to target cells. To test the in vivo role of Gal-1 in DENV infection, Gal-1-deficient-mice were used to demonstrate that the expression of endogenous Galectin-1 contributes to resistance of macrophages to in vitro-infection with DENV-1 and it is also important to physiological susceptibility of mice to in vivo infection with DENV-1. These results provide novel insights into the functions of Gal-1 in resistance to DENV infection and suggest that Gal-1 should be explored as a potential antiviral compound.

TI  - Gamma Interferon (IFN-γ) Receptor Restricts Systemic Dengue Virus Replication and Prevents Paralysis in IFN-α/β Receptor-Deficient Mice
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 12561
EP  - 12570
AB  - ABSTRACT We previously reported that mice lacking alpha/beta and gamma interferon receptors (IFN-α/βR and -γR) uniformly exhibit paralysis following infection with the dengue virus (DENV) clinical isolate PL046, while only a subset of mice lacking the IFN-γR alone and virtually no mice lacking the IFN-α/βR alone develop paralysis. Here, using a mouse-passaged variant of PL046, strain S221, we show that in the absence of the IFN-α/βR, signaling through the IFN-γR confers approximately 140-fold greater resistance against systemic vascular leakage-associated dengue disease and virtually complete protection from dengue-induced paralysis. Viral replication in the spleen was assessed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, which revealed a reduction in the number of infected cells due to IFN-γR signaling by 2 days after infection, coincident with elevated levels of IFN-γ in the spleen and serum. By 4 days after infection, IFN-γR signaling was found to restrict DENV replication systemically. Clearance of DENV, on the other hand, occurred in the absence of IFN-γR, except in the central nervous system (CNS) (brain and spinal cord), where clearance relied on IFN-γ from CD8+ T cells. These results demonstrate the roles of IFN-γR signaling in protection from initial systemic and subsequent CNS disease following DENV infection and demonstrate the importance of CD8+ T cells in preventing DENV-induced CNS disease.

TI  - Gamma interferon augments Fc gamma receptor-mediated dengue virus infection of human monocytic cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 62
SP  - 3928
EP  - 3933
AB  - It has been reported that anti-dengue antibodies at subneutralizing concentrations augment dengue virus infection of monocytic cells. This is due to the increased uptake of dengue virus in the form of virus-antibody complexes by cells via Fc gamma receptors. We analyzed the effects of recombinant human gamma interferon (rIFN-gamma) on dengue virus infection of human monocytic cells. U937 cells, a human monocytic cell line, were infected with dengue virus in the form of virus-antibody complexes after rIFN-gamma treatment. Pretreatment of U937 cells with rIFN-gamma resulted in a significant increase in the number of dengue virus-infected cells and in the yield of infectious virus. rIFN-gamma did not augment dengue virus infection when cells were infected with virus in the absence of anti-dengue antibodies. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) produced by peripheral blood lymphocytes from dengue-immune donors after in vitro stimulation with dengue antigens also augmented dengue virus infection of U937 cells. IFN-gamma did not augment dengue virus infections when cells were infected with virus in the presence of F(ab')2 prepared from anti-dengue immunoglobulin G. Human immunoglobulin inhibited IFN-gamma-induced augmentation. IFN-gamma increased the number of Fc gamma receptors on U937 cells. The increase in the percentage of dengue antigen-positive cells correlated with the increase in the number of Fc gamma receptors after rIFN-gamma treatment. These results indicate that IFN-gamma-induced augmentation of dengue virus infection is Fc gamma receptor mediated. Based on these results we conclude that IFN-gamma increases the number of Fc gamma receptors and that this leads to an augmented uptake of dengue virus in the form of dengue virus-antibody complexes, which results in augmented dengue virus infection.

TI  - Gene Expression Profiling of Early Acute Febrile Stage of Dengue Infection and Its Comparative Analysis With Streptococcus pneumoniae Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Infectious diseases are the disorders caused by organisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. Although many of them are permentantly hazardous, a number of them live in and on our bodies and they are normally harmless or even helpful. Under certain circumstances, some organisms may cause diseases and these infectious diseases may be passed directly from person to person or via intermediate vectors including insects and other animals. Dengue virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the critical and common sources of infectious diseases. So, it is critical to understand the gene expression profiling and their inferred functions in comparison to the normal and virus infected conditions. Here, we have analyzed the gene expression profiling for dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue fever, and normal human dataset. Similar to it, streptococcus pneumoniae infectious data were analyzed and both the outcomes were compared. Our study leads to the conclusion that the dengue hemorrhagic fever arises in result to potential change in the gene expression pattern, and the inferred functions obviously belong to the immune system, but also there are some additional potential pathways which are critical signaling pathways. In the case of pneumoniae infection, 19 pathways were enriched, almost all these pathways are associated with the immune system and 17 of the enriched pathways were common with dengue infection except platelet activation and antigen processing and presentation. In terms of the comparative study between dengue virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, we conclude that cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), MAPK signaling pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction are commonly enriched in all the three cases of dengue infection and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, focal adhesion was enriched between classical dengue fever — dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever—normal samples, and SP, and antigen processing and presentation and Leukocyte transendothelial migration were enriched in classical dengue fever —normal samples, dengue hemorrhagic fever—normal samples, and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection.

TI  - Gene Expression in Human Macrophages Infected with Dengue Virus Serotype‐2
JF  - Scandinavian Journal of Immunology
VL  - 60
AB  - Infection by any of the four serotypes of dengue viruses (DEN‐1, ‐2, ‐3 and ‐4) may result in either a relatively benign fever, called dengue fever (DF), a fatal disease, such as dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Several lines of evidence suggest that soluble immune response mediators may be involved in the severity of dengue infections. For instance, elevated seric levels of IL‐8 are a common feature in DHF patients. Because other chemokines, cytokines, adhesion molecules, chemokine and cytokine receptors, as well as cytokine‐related molecules may also be involved in dengue virus pathogenesis, we aimed at analysing the gene expression of such molecules in the course of an in vitro DEN‐2 infection of human peripheral blood monocyte‐derived macrophages, a cell type regarded as a primary target for DEN. Nylon membrane gene arrays containing 375 different human cytokine‐related genes were used as a first step to search for differentially expressed genes upon infection. Transcripts for IL‐8, IL‐1β, osteopontin, GRO‐α, ‐β and ‐γ, I‐309, and some other molecules showed to be upregulated upon infection, whereas others such as MIC‐1, CD27L and CD30L, were downregulated. Four genes were selected for reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction based gene‐expression analysis as a way to partially confirm microarray results. This approach pointed out 25 macrophage‐expressed cytokine‐related genes that could be relevant in DEN‐2 pathogenesis.

TI  - Gene Polymorphisms and Serum Levels of Pro- and Anti-Inflammatory Markers in Dengue Viral Infections.
JF  - Viral immunology

SP  - 379
EP  - 88
AB  - Pro- and anti-inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, TNF-β, interferon [IFN]-γ, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, IL-10, and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were investigated in 80 patients infected with dengue viruses, 100 patients presenting with febrile illness but negative for dengue, and 99 healthy subjects. Immunoenzyme methods were used for quantitative assays in the plasma. Polymorphisms of TNF-α, TNF-β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 genes were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism and allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO)-PCR for the IFN-γ. The highest mean serum levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-8, and CRP were observed in dengue-positive individuals. TNF-β, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in the dengue-negative individuals. No cytokine expression pattern was evidenced according to virus serotype. Genotypic frequency distributions were statistically significant for the polymorphisms of TNF-α and IFN-γ among positive, negative, and control dengue groups and IFN-γ among groups DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and controls. Modulation of cytokine expression and polymorphisms is a complex matter and needs further explanation considering the ethnic origins of the Brazilian population.

TI  - Gene distribution of ABO blood type system on the Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) patients in the working area of Puskesmas Bonto Bangun, District of Rilau Ale, Bulukumba
JF  - Journal of Physics: Conference Series
VL  - 979
AB  - This research is about gene distribution of ABO blood type system on the Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) patients in the working area of Puskesmas Bonto Bangun, District of Rilau Ale, Bulukumba. This research aimed to determine the blood type which is most affected by DHF using ABO blood type system. In this research, there are 104 samples, 8 of them were attacked by DF and 96 were attacked by DHF. From the 96 patients of DHF, there were 38 patients with A-blood type, 17 patients with B-blood type, 36 patients with O-blood type and 5 patients of AB-blood type. The data were tested using genotype frequency test and the results showed that the percentage of A-homozygous blood type (IAIA) is 0:09%; A heterozygous blood type (IAIo) is 0:36%; B-homozygous blood type (IBIB) is 0.01%; B heterozygous blood type (IB Io) is 0.12%; AB blood type (IAIB) is 0.06% and O blood type (IoIo) is 12:36%. So the biggest frequency of genotype are IAIo (0.36%) and IoIo (0.36%). The results showed that O blood type gene is the most affected by DHF. Then continued by the regression test between blood type and DHF, it is obtained that the correlation value is 1 which indicated that there is a strong relationship.

TI  - Gene expression profiling by microarray analysis reveals an important role for caspase‐1 in dengue virus‐induced p53‐mediated apoptosis
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 81
AB  - Recently, a dengue virus‐induced apoptosis p53‐ and mitochondria‐mediated were reported in human and animal cells. To understand further the underlying mechanisms, a p53‐deficient cell line, H1299, and a p53‐knockin cell line, H273, were infected with dengue type 1 virus and the cellular gene expression profiles at the mRNA level were analyzed by affymetrix array analysis. The results showed 183 genes with at least twofold increase at mRNA expression level in dengue virus‐infected cells. Among the 183 genes, 68 genes were up‐regulated in both H1299 and H273 cells and 78 genes were found to be up‐regulated in only H273 cells. Eleven selected genes, mainly involved in IFN‐pathway, cell cycle, signal transduction, and ubiquitin–proteasome pathways were confirmed using qualitative and quantitative PCR. Interestingly, an approximately 32‐fold increase in caspase‐1 expression was observed in the p53‐knockin cell line, H273. Gene silencing of caspase‐1 or inhibition of caspase‐1 activity led to reduction in dengue virus‐induced apoptosis with minimal effect on virus replication. J. Med.

TI  - Gene expression profiling of dengue infected human primary cells identifies secreted mediators in vivo
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 81
AB  - We used gene expression profiling of human primary cells infected in vitro with dengue virus (DENV) as a tool to identify secreted mediators induced in response to the infection. Affymetrix GeneChip analysis of human primary monocytes, B cells and dendritic cells infected with DENV in vitro showed strong induction of monocyte chemotactic protein 2 (MCP‐2/CCL8), interferon gamma‐induced protein 10 (IP‐10/CXCL10) and tumor necrosis factor‐related apoptosis‐inducing ligand (TRAIL/TNFSF10). The expression of these genes was confirmed in dendritic cells infected with DENV in vitro at mRNA and protein levels. A prospectively enrolled cohort of DENV‐infected Venezuelan patients was used to measure the levels of these proteins in serum during three different periods of the disease. Results showed significant increase of MCP‐2, IP‐10, and TRAIL levels in patients infected with DENV during the febrile period, when compared to healthy donors and patients with other febrile illnesses. MCP‐2 and IP‐10 levels were still elevated during the post‐febrile period while TRAIL levels dropped close to normal after defervescense. Patients with primary infections had higher TRAIL levels than patients with secondary infections during the febrile period of the disease. Increased levels of IP‐10, TRAIL and MCP‐2 in acute DENV infections suggest a role for these mediators in the immune response to the infection. MCP‐2 was identified in this work as a new unreported and important dengue‐related protein and IP‐10 was confirmed as a novel and strong pro‐inflammatory marker in acute disease. J. Med.

TI  - Generation of Anti-platelet Autoantibody During Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - American Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 4
SP  - 50
EP  - 59
AB  - Dengue virus infection causes dengue fever, Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). Thrombocytopenia is common in dengue fever and is always found in DHF/DSS. The pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia is poorly understood. To further understand the relationship between anti-dengue virus antibody and anti-platelet antibody, we generated monoclonal anti-dengue virus antibodies from the dengue virus infected mice that developed transient thrombocytopenia post dengue infection. The analysis of a panel of monoclonal anti-NS-1 antibodies reveals three different patterns of platelet binding: strong, intermediate, or dull. Their isotypes are different, some are IgM while others are IgG1. Most of anti-platelet antibodies are cross-reactive with NS-1 of dengue virus and can be competitively inhibited by recombinant NS-1 protein, suggesting a molecular mimicry between dengue virus NS-1 protein and platelet. A clone, 13-F4-G5, preferentially bound activated platelets, can recognize two or three proteins around 150 kD on platelets. The binding to platelet would lyse the platelet in the presence of complement or enhance the ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Furthermore, some of these monoclonal antibodies would also react with the cellular antigens of BHK. Based on the data, we conclude that dengue virus infection induces auto anti-platelet antibodies which thereafter may involve in the manifestation of thrombocytopenia. A molecular mimicry between NS-1 and platelet is demonstrated.

JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 63
AB  - Dengue virus infection causes a wide range of diseases from dengue fever to life‐threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). The mechanisms involved in DHF/DSS pathogenesis remain unclear. Patient sera collected from an outbreak in southern Taiwan from November 1998 to January 1999 were studied. The presence of antibodies which cross‐reacted with platelets could be detected in patient sera, and the isotype of these autoantibodies was IgM. The anti‐platelet IgM levels were higher in DHF/DSS than in dengue fever patient sera in disease acute phase. These autoantibodies were still detectable in convalescent stage (1–3 weeks after acute phase) and even eight to nine months after illness. The platelet binding activity was not observed in other virus‐infected patient sera tested. Further investigation showed that dengue patient sera caused platelet lysis in the presence of complement. The platelet cytotoxicity induced by DHF/DSS patient sera was higher than that by dengue fever sera. Dengue patient sera also inhibited platelet aggregation which, however, appeared to be not related to DHF/DSS development. J. Med. Virol. 63:143–149, 2001. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

TI  - Genetic Association Studies of MICB and PLCE1 with Severity of Dengue in Indonesian and Taiwanese Populations

VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue is an arboviral disease that has spread globally and become a major public health concern. A small proportion of patients may progress from symptomatic dengue fever (DF) to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Findings from a previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) demonstrated that variations in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related B (MICB) and the phospholipase C epsilon 1 (PLCE1) genes were related to DSS in a Vietnamese population. This study investigated associations of variations in MICB (rs3132468) and PLCE1 (rs3740360, rs3765524) with dengue severity and thrombocytopenia in both the Indonesian and Taiwanese populations. We sampled 160 patients from the Indonesian population and 273 patients from the Taiwanese population. None of the patients had DSS in the Taiwanese population. Based on age demographics, we found that dengue is more prevalent among younger individuals in the Indonesian population, whereas it has a greater impact on adults in the Taiwanese population. Our results showed the association between MICB rs3132468 and DSS. In addition, an association was identified between PLCE1 rs3740360 and DHF in secondary dengue in Indonesian patients. However, there is no association of MICB or PLCE1 variants with thrombocytopenia. This study highlights the value of genetic testing, which might be included in the clinical pathway for specific patients who can be protected from severe dengue.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases constitute a large portion of infectious diseases, causing more than 700,000 deaths annually. Mosquito-transmitted viruses, such as yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, have re-emerged recently and remain a public health threat worldwide. Global climate change, rapid urbanization, burgeoning international travel, expansion of mosquito populations, vector competence, and host and viral genetics may all together contribute to the re-emergence of arboviruses. In this brief review, we summarize the host and viral genetic determinants that may enhance infectivity in the host, viral fitness in mosquitoes and viral transmission by mosquitoes.

TI  - Genetic Interaction of Flavivirus Nonstructural Proteins NS1 and NS4A as a Determinant of Replicase Function
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 73
SP  - 4611
EP  - 4621
AB  - ABSTRACT Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of yellow fever virus (YF) is a glycoprotein localized to extracytoplasmic compartments within infected cells. We have previously shown that NS1 can be supplied intrans and is required for viral RNA replication, a process thought to occur in membrane-bound cytoplasmic complexes. Here we report that the NS1 gene from a related virus, dengue virus (DEN), is unable to function in the process of YF RNA replication. This virus-specific incompatibility leads to a lack of initial minus-strand accumulation, suggesting that DEN NS1 is unable to productively interact with the YF replicase. Based on a YF deletion mutant that requires NS1 in trans, a genetic screen for suppressor mutants was used to select virus variants able to utilize DEN NS1. In three independent selections, a single mutation was mapped to the NS4A gene, which encodes a putative transmembrane replicase component. This mutation, as well as several additional mutations, was engineered into the NS1-deficient genome and confirmed a genetic interaction between NS1 and NS4A. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for integrating NS1 into the cytoplasmic process of RNA replication.

TI  - Genetic Mapping of Specific Interactions between Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes and Dengue Viruses
JF  - PLoS Genetics
VL  - 9
AB  - Specific interactions between host genotypes and pathogen genotypes (G×G interactions) are commonly observed in invertebrate systems. Such specificity challenges our current understanding of invertebrate defenses against pathogens because it contrasts the limited discriminatory power of known invertebrate immune responses. Lack of a mechanistic explanation, however, has questioned the nature of host factors underlying G×G interactions. In this study, we aimed to determine whether G×G interactions observed between dengue viruses and their Aedes aegypti vectors in nature can be mapped to discrete loci in the mosquito genome and to document their genetic architecture. We developed an innovative genetic mapping strategy to survey G×G interactions using outbred mosquito families that were experimentally exposed to genetically distinct isolates of two dengue virus serotypes derived from human patients. Genetic loci associated with vector competence indices were detected in multiple regions of the mosquito genome. Importantly, correlation between genotype and phenotype was virus isolate-specific at several of these loci, indicating G×G interactions. The relatively high percentage of phenotypic variation explained by the markers associated with G×G interactions (ranging from 7.8% to 16.5%) is consistent with large-effect host genetic factors. Our data demonstrate that G×G interactions between dengue viruses and mosquito vectors can be assigned to physical regions of the mosquito genome, some of which have a large effect on the phenotype. This finding establishes the existence of tangible host genetic factors underlying specific interactions between invertebrates and their pathogens in a natural system. Fine mapping of the uncovered genetic loci will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of mosquito-virus specificity.

TI  - Genetic Polymorphisms of HLA and HLA-Related Proteins: Implications on Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Mosquito Research
VL  - 3
AB  - Dengue diseases pathogenesis is not yet completely understood. Several human immunities are controlled by the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and expressions of HLA molecules are increased in dengue viral (DENV) infection. The role of cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognizing DENV epitopes presented by the HLA is the basis for immunity of DENV infection. The genes encoding classical HLA class I (HLA-A, -B, -C) and class II (HLA-DR, DQ and DP) are the most polymorphic in the human genome, and specific polymorphisms in human HLA gene regions influence peptide epitope binding. Here we have reviewed the implication of HLA and HLA-related gene polymorphisms on DENV infection susceptibility, protection and severity. We found several studies have identified HLA alleles associated with DENV infection susceptibility and severity such as A*0207, A*1, A*2, A*24, A*31, B blank, B*13, B*40, B*46, B*51, B*52, B*53, B*57, DR1, DRB1*08, DRB1*12, DRB1*15 and TNF-α i?½308A allele. Whereas some HLA alleles such as A*0203, A*03, A*29, A*33, B*13, B*14, B*15, B*18, B*44, B*49, B*52, B*62, B*76, B*77, DRB1*0901, DRB1*02, DRB1*03, DRB1*04, and DRB1*07 are associated with DENV infection protection. In addition, HLA class III and HLA-related proteins - mayor histocompatibility complex class I chain-related protein A and B (MICA and MICB) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA) - also associated with DENV infection. In summary, HLA and several HLA-related proteins clearly play important roles on DENV infection susceptibility, protection and severity.

AB  - To evaluate the association of the -308 and -238 tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) gene polymorphisms with clinical manifestations of dengue and TNF-α serum levels in a northwestern Mexican population. The study populations included dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) patients, and a group of healthy controls (HCs) without history of dengue. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay were performed to determine genotypes and serum concentration of TNF-α, respectively. There were no significant differences in alleles, genotypes, and haplotype frequencies between patients and HCs. However, when patients were separated into DF and DHF, there was an increased prevalence of the -308 GA genotype in HCs compared to DHF (odds ratio [OR] = 0.129, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.018-0.945, p = 0.025), as well as the GG haplotype (OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.273-0.880, p = 0.01757) in DF. The genotypes of both polymorphisms were not associated with hematologic manifestations. Serum TNF-α levels were significantly higher in patients than in HCs (p = 0.004). Our results suggest a minimal effect of the -308 and -238 TNF-α gene polymorphisms in dengue patients and that their increased serum levels of TNF-α are independent of genotypes.

AB  - This article focuses on the host genetic predisposition to 2 viruses, West Nile virus and dengue virus, which belong to the genus Flavivirus. Although by definition these viruses have shared characteristics (e.g. similar size, single stranded, RNA viruses, both transmitted by the bite from an infected mosquito), they differ greatly in epidemiology and clinical manifestations. The text below not only summarizes the genetic factors that predispose to complications of these 2 important flaviviruses, but also illustrates the challenges in determining the genomic basis for complications to these viruses.

TI  - Genetic Variance and Genotype-by-Environment Interaction of Immune Response in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)
VL  - 47
SP  - 111
EP  - 120
AB  - ABSTRACT 
 Immune response can be negatively affected by resource limitation, so it is expected that organisms evolve strategies to minimize the impact of this environmental outcome. Phenotypic plasticity in immune response could represent a genetic response to face such situations. We investigated the effects of high and low quality and quantity of food at the larval stage on two important immune components, phenoloxidase activity (PO) and nitric oxide production (NO) measured in adults of the Dengue vector, Aedes aegypti. We reared families to determine the magnitude and pattern of expression of genetic variance, environmental variance and genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI). In addition, we quantified whether there were differences in plastic immune responses in both sexes. Our results indicated additive variance for PO and NO, but rearing environment did not produce differences among individuals. For NO and PO in males, there were large differences among families in plasticity, as indicated by the different slopes produced by each reaction norm. Therefore, there is additive genetic variation in plasticity for NO production and PO activity. One possible interpretation of these results is that different genotypes may be favored to fight pathogens under the different food quality situations. Males and females showed similar overall GEI strategies but there were differences in PO and NO. Males showed a phenotypic correlation between PO and NO, but we did not find genetic correlations between immune parameters in both sexes.

TI  - Genetic Variants of MICB and PLCE1 and Associations with Non-Severe Dengue
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 8
AB  - Background A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified susceptibility loci for dengue shock syndrome (DSS) at MICB rs3132468 and PLCE1 rs3740360. The aim of this study was to define the extent to which MICB (rs3132468) and PLCE1 (rs3740360) were associated with less severe clinical phenotypes of pediatric and adult dengue. Methods 3961 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases and 5968 controls were genotyped at MICB rs3132468 and PLCE1 rs3740360. Per-allele odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each patient cohort. Pooled analyses were performed for adults and paediatrics respectively using a fixed effects model. Results Pooled analysis of the paediatric and adult cohorts indicated a significant association between MICB rs3132468 and dengue cases without shock (OR  =  1.15; 95%CI: 1.07 – 1.24; P  =  0.0012). Similarly, pooled analysis of pediatric and adult cohorts indicated a significant association between dengue cases without shock and PLCE1 rs3740360 (OR  =  0.92; 95%CI: 0.85 – 0.99; P  =  0.018). We also note significant association between both SNPs (OR  =  1.48; P  =  0.0075 for MICB rs3132468 and OR  =  0.75, P  =  0.041 for PLCE1 rs3740360) and dengue in infants. Discussion This study confirms that the MICB rs3132468 and PLCE1 rs3740360 risk genotypes are not only associated with DSS, but are also associated with less severe clinical phenotypes of dengue, as well as with dengue in infants. These findings have implications for our understanding of dengue pathogenesis.

TI  - Genetic association study of interferon lambda 3, CD27, and human leukocyte antigen-DPB1 with dengue severity in Thailand
JF  - BMC Infectious Diseases
VL  - 20
AB  - Background Dengue patients develop different disease severity ranging from mild (dengue fever [DF]) to severe forms (dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] and the fatal dengue shock syndrome [DSS]). Host genetics are considered to be one factor responsible for the severity of dengue outcomes. To identify genes associated with dengue severity that have not been studied yet, we performed genetic association analyses of interferon lambda 3 (IFNL3) , CD27 , and human leukocyte antigen-DPB1 (HLA-DPB1) genes in Thai dengue patients. Methods A case–control association study was performed in 877 children (age ≤ 15 years) with dengue infection (DF, n  = 386; DHF, n  = 416; DSS, n  = 75). A candidate single nucleotide polymorphism of each of IFNL3, CD27, and HLA-DPB1 was selected to be analyzed. Genotyping was performed by TaqMan real-time PCR assay, and the association with dengue severity was examined. Results The rs9277534 variant of HLA-DPB1 was weakly associated with DHF. The genotype GG and G allele conferred protection against DHF ( p  = 0.04, odds ratio 0.74 for GG genotype, p  = 0.03, odds ratio 0.79 for G allele). The association became borderline significant after adjusting for confounders ( p  = 0.05, odds ratio 0.82). No association was detected for IFNL3 or CD27 . Conclusions The present study demonstrated the weak association of the rs9277534 variant of HLA-DPB1 with protection against DHF. This variant is in the 3′ untranslated region and affects HLA-DPB1 surface protein expression. Our finding suggests that HLA-DPB1 may be involved in DHF pathogenesis.

AB  - The dengue virus (DENV) belongs to the flavivirus family. Each of the four distinct serotypes of this virus is capable of causing human disease, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. The majority of people infected with DENV manifest asymptomatic or dengue fever with flu-like self-limited symptoms. However, a small portion of patients emerge with severe manifestations referred to as dengue hemorrhagic fever, which has a high mortality rate if not treated promptly. The host immune system, which plays important roles throughout the whole process of DENV infection, has been confirmed to have double-edged effects on DENV infection. Recently, much attention has been paid to the genetic heterogeneity of molecules involved in the host immune response to DENV infection. This heterogeneity has been proved to be the determining factor for DENV disease orientation. The present review discusses the primary functions and single nucleotide polymorphisms of some critical molecules in the human DENV immunological defense, especially the polymorphism locus associated with the DENV pathogenesis and disease susceptibility.

Laboratory variables were compared between genotypes and stratified by DENV serotype.ResultsThe analysis showed no association between MICB and PLCE1 genotype and early viraemia level, platelet nadir, white cell count nadir, or maximum haematocrit in both overall analysis and in analysis stratified by serotype.DiscussionThe lack of an association between genotype and viremia level may reflect the sampling procedures within the included studies.

JF  - RNA
VL  - 14 12

EP  - 56
AB  - Genomes of RNA viruses encounter a continual threat from host cellular ribonucleases. Therefore, viruses have evolved mechanisms to protect the integrity of their genomes. To study the mechanism of 3'-end repair in dengue virus-2 in mammalian cells, a series of 3'-end deletions in the genome were evaluated for virus replication by detection of viral antigen NS1 and by sequence analysis. Limited deletions did not cause any delay in the detection of NS1 within 5 d. However, deletions of 7-10 nucleotides caused a delay of 9 d in the detection of NS1. Sequence analysis of RNAs from recovered viruses showed that at early times, virus progenies evolved through RNA molecules of heterogeneous lengths and nucleotide sequences at the 3' end, suggesting a possible role for terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity of the viral polymerase (NS5). However, this diversity gradually diminished and consensus sequences emerged. Template activities of 3'-end mutants in the synthesis of negative-strand RNA in vitro by purified NS5 correlate well with the abilities of mutant RNAs to repair and produce virus progenies. Using the Mfold program for RNA structure prediction, we show that if the 3' stem-loop (3' SL) structure was abrogated by mutations, viruses eventually restored the 3' SL structure. Taken together, these results favor a two-step repair process: non-template-based nucleotide addition followed by evolutionary selection of 3'-end sequences based on the best-fit RNA structure that can support viral replication.

TI  - Genome Investigations of Vector Competence in Aedes aegypti to Inform Novel Arbovirus Disease Control Approaches
JF  - Insects
VL  - 7
AB  - Dengue (DENV), yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika virus transmission to humans by a mosquito host is confounded by both intrinsic and extrinsic variables. Besides virulence factors of the individual arboviruses, likelihood of virus transmission is subject to variability in the genome of the primary mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. The “vectorial capacity” of A. aegypti varies depending upon its density, biting rate, and survival rate, as well as its intrinsic ability to acquire, host and transmit a given arbovirus. This intrinsic ability is known as “vector competence”. Based on whole transcriptome analysis, several genes and pathways have been predicated to have an association with a susceptible or refractory response in A. aegypti to DENV infection. However, the functional genomics of vector competence of A. aegypti is not well understood, primarily due to lack of integrative approaches in genomic or transcriptomic studies. In this review, we focus on the present status of genomics studies of DENV vector competence in A. aegypti as limited information is available relative to the other arboviruses. We propose future areas of research needed to facilitate the integration of vector and virus genomics and environmental factors to work towards better understanding of vector competence and vectorial capacity in natural conditions.

TI  - Genome-Wide Analysis to Identify HLA Factors Potentially Associated With Severe Dengue
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 9
AB  - The pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), following dengue virus (DENV) infection, is a complex and poorly understood phenomenon. In view of the clinical need of identifying patients with higher likelihood of developing this severe outcome, we undertook a comparative genome-wide association analysis of epitope variants from sequences available in the ViPR database that have been reported to be differentially related to dengue fever and DHF. Having enumerated the incriminated epitope variants, we determined the corresponding HLA alleles in the context of which DENV infection could potentially precipitate DHF. Our analysis considered the development of DHF in three different perspectives: (a) as a consequence of primary DENV infection, (b) following secondary DENV infection with a heterologous serotype, (c) as a result of DENV infection following infection with related flaviviruses like Zika virus, Japanese Encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, etc. Subject to experimental validation, these viral and host markers would be valuable in triaging DENV-infected patients for closer supervision owing to the relatively higher risk of poor prognostic outcome and also for the judicious allocation of scarce institutional resources during large outbreaks.

TI  - Genome-Wide CRISPR Screen Identifies RACK1 as a Critical Host Factor for Flavivirus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Cellular factors are critical in all facets of viral lifecycles, where overlapping interactions between the virus and host can be exploited as possible avenues for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Using a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening approach to identify novel cellular factors important for flavivirus replication we identified RACK1 as a pro-viral host factor for both mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2. ABSTRACT Cellular factors have important roles in all facets of the flavivirus replication cycle. Deciphering viral-host protein interactions is essential for understanding the flavivirus life cycle as well as development of effective antiviral strategies. To uncover novel host factors that are co-opted by multiple flaviviruses, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome wide knockout (KO) screen was employed to identify genes required for replication of Zika virus (ZIKV). Receptor for Activated Protein C Kinase 1 (RACK1) was identified as a novel host factor required for ZIKV replication, which was confirmed via complementary experiments. Depletion of RACK1 via siRNA demonstrated that RACK1 is important for replication of a wide range of mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses, including West Nile Virus (WNV), Dengue Virus (DENV), Powassan Virus (POWV) and Langat Virus (LGTV) as well as the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, but not for YFV, EBOV, VSV or HSV. Notably, flavivirus replication was only abrogated when RACK1 expression was dampened prior to infection. Utilising a non-replicative flavivirus model, we show altered morphology of viral replication factories and reduced formation of vesicle packets (VPs) in cells lacking RACK1 expression. In addition, RACK1 interacted with NS1 protein from multiple flaviviruses; a key protein for replication complex formation. Overall, these findings reveal RACK1’s crucial role to the biogenesis of pan-flavivirus replication organelles. IMPORTANCE Cellular factors are critical in all facets of viral lifecycles, where overlapping interactions between the virus and host can be exploited as possible avenues for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Using a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening approach to identify novel cellular factors important for flavivirus replication we identified RACK1 as a pro-viral host factor for both mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2. Using an innovative flavivirus protein expression system, we demonstrate for the first time the impact of the loss of RACK1 on the formation of viral replication factories known as 'vesicle packets' (VPs). In addition, we show that RACK1 can interact with numerous flavivirus NS1 proteins as a potential mechanism by which VP formation can be induced by the former.

TI  - Genome-Wide Expression Profiling Deciphers Host Responses Altered during Dengue Shock Syndrome and Reveals the Role of Innate Immunity in Severe Dengue
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 5
AB  - Background Deciphering host responses contributing to dengue shock syndrome (DSS), the life-threatening form of acute viral dengue infections, is required to improve both the differential prognosis and the treatments provided to DSS patients, a challenge for clinicians. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on a prospective study, we analyzed the genome-wide expression profiles of whole blood cells from 48 matched Cambodian children: 19 progressed to DSS while 16 and 13 presented respectively classical dengue fever (DF) or dengue hemorrhagic fever grades I/II (DHF). Using multi-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and adjustment of p-values to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR<10%), we identified a signature of 2959 genes differentiating DSS patients from both DF and DHF, and showed a strong association of this DSS-gene signature with the dengue disease phenotype. Using a combined approach to analyse the molecular patterns associated with the DSS-gene signature, we provide an integrative overview of the transcriptional responses altered in DSS children. In particular, we show that the transcriptome of DSS children blood cells is characterized by a decreased abundance of transcripts related to T and NK lymphocyte responses and by an increased abundance of anti-inflammatory and repair/remodeling transcripts. We also show that unexpected pro-inflammatory gene patterns at the interface between innate immunity, inflammation and host lipid metabolism, known to play pathogenic roles in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with systemic vascular dysfunction, are transcriptionnally active in the blood cells of DSS children. Conclusions/Significance We provide a global while non exhaustive overview of the molecular mechanisms altered in of DSS children and suggest how they may interact to lead to final vascular homeostasis breakdown. We suggest that some mechanisms identified should be considered putative therapeutic targets or biomarkers of progression to DSS.

TI  - Genome-Wide Mutagenesis of Dengue Virus Reveals Plasticity of the NS1 Protein and Enables Generation of Infectious Tagged Reporter Viruses
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a major global pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. An improved understanding of the regions within the DENV genome and its encoded proteins that are required for the virus replication cycle will expedite the development of urgently required therapeutics and vaccines. We subjected an infectious DENV genome to unbiased insertional mutagenesis and used next-generation sequencing to identify sites that tolerate 15-nucleotide insertions during the virus replication cycle in hepatic cell culture. This revealed that the regions within capsid, NS1, and the 3′ untranslated region were the most tolerant of insertions. In contrast, prM- and NS2A-encoding regions were largely intolerant of insertions. Notably, the multifunctional NS1 protein readily tolerated insertions in regions within the Wing, connector, and β-ladder domains with minimal effects on viral RNA replication and infectious virus production. Using this information, we generated infectious reporter viruses, including a variant encoding the APEX2 electron microscopy tag in NS1 that uniquely enabled high-resolution imaging of its localization to the surface and interior of viral replication vesicles. In addition, we generated a tagged virus bearing an mScarlet fluorescent protein insertion in NS1 that, despite an impact on fitness, enabled live cell imaging of NS1 localization and traffic in infected cells. Overall, this genome-wide profile of DENV genome flexibility may be further dissected and exploited in reporter virus generation and antiviral strategies. IMPORTANCE Regions of genetic flexibility in viral genomes can be exploited in the generation of reporter virus tools and should arguably be avoided in antiviral drug and vaccine design. Here, we subjected the DENV genome to high-throughput insertional mutagenesis to identify regions of genetic flexibility and enable tagged reporter virus generation. In particular, the viral NS1 protein displayed remarkable tolerance of small insertions. This genetic flexibility enabled generation of several novel NS1-tagged reporter viruses, including an APEX2-tagged virus that we used in high-resolution imaging of NS1 localization in infected cells by electron microscopy. For the first time, this analysis revealed the localization of NS1 within viral replication factories known as “vesicle packets” (VPs), in addition to its acknowledged localization to the luminal surface of these VPs. Together, this genetic profile of DENV may be further refined and exploited in the identification of antiviral targets and the generation of reporter virus tools.

TI  - Genome-wide Associations of Flavivirus Capsid Proteins
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are both positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses. They are packaged within the virion with a capsid (C) protein to form the nucleocapsid. Based on cryo-electron microscopy imaging, the nucleocapsid has been described as lacking symmetry, whilst there is distinguishable separation of the C proteins from the viral RNA (vRNA) genome. Here, to elucidate the architecture of the nucleocapsid of DENV serotype 2 and ZIKV, we used a nuclease digestion assay and next-generation sequencing to map the respective vRNA genome wide association with the C protein in vitro. The C protein exhibited non-uniform binding along the vRNA, and as C protein concentration increased, the normalized read counts also increased. A saturation point of 1:100 (vRNA:C protein monomers) was found, and binding regions showed variable saturation patterns. We also observed that C protein had a preference for G-rich sequences for both viruses. Taken together, we demonstrate that the DENV 2 and ZIKV C proteins bind vRNA in a non-uniform manner with distinct patterns of association. Singificance Statement Our study demonstrates that flavivirus capsid proteins associate with the viral genome at specific sites rather than in a uniform manner as commonly expected. We estimate the number of capsid proteins binding to a single genomic RNA. We proceed to locate the capsid binding sites along the viral genomes of Dengue and Zika viruses. We characterize the binding sites in terms of affinity and analyze the nucleotide composition and sequence motifs at binding sites. We cross-reference binding sites against SHAPE reactivity data corresponding to local RNA secondary structure, which allows us to identify structural motifs of capsid binding sites. As capsid proteins are essential for viral packaging, these interactions may form attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Genome-wide analyses reveal a highly conserved Dengue virus envelope peptide which is critical for virus viability and antigenic in humans
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 6
AB  - Targeting regions of proteins that show a high degree of structural conservation has been proposed as a method of developing immunotherapies and vaccines that may bypass the wide genetic variability of RNA viruses. Despite several attempts, a vaccine that protects evenly against the four circulating Dengue virus (DV) serotypes remains elusive. To find critical conserved amino acids in dengue viruses, 120 complete genomes of each serotype were selected at random and used to calculate conservation scores for nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The identified peptide sequences were analysed for their structural conservation and localisation using crystallographic data. The longest, surface exposed, highly conserved peptide of Envelope protein was found to correspond to amino acid residues 250 to 270. Mutation of this peptide in DV1 was lethal, since no replication of the mutant virus was detected in human cells. Antibodies against this peptide were detected in DV naturally infected patients indicating its potential antigenicity. Hence, this study has identified a highly conserved, critical peptide in DV that is a target of antibodies in infected humans.

TI  - Genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for Dengue shock syndrome at MICB and PLCE1
JF  - Nature genetics
VL  - 43
SP  - 1139
EP  - 1141
AB  - Hypovolemic shock (dengue shock syndrome (DSS)) is the most common life-threatening complication of dengue. We conducted a genome-wide association study of 2,008 pediatric cases treated for DSS and 2,018 controls from Vietnam. Replication of the most significantly associated markers was carried out in an independent Vietnamese sample of 1,737 cases and 2,934 controls. SNPs at two loci showed genome-wide significant association with DSS. We identified a susceptibility locus at MICB (major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I polypeptide-related sequence B), which was within the broad MHC region on chromosome 6 but outside the class I and class II HLA loci (rs3132468, Pmeta = 4.41 × 10−11, per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.34 (95% confidence interval: 1.23–1.46)). We identified associated variants within PLCE1 (phospholipase C, epsilon 1) on chromosome 10 (rs3765524, Pmeta = 3.08 × 10−10, per-allele OR = 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.75–0.86)). We identify two loci associated with susceptibility to DSS in people with dengue, suggesting possible mechanisms for this severe complication of dengue.

TI  - Genome-wide identification of Aedes albopictus long noncoding RNAs and their association with dengue and zika virus infection
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Ae. albopictus), is an important vector that transmits arboviruses such as dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). On the other hand, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to regulate various biological processes. Knowledge on Ae. albopictus lncRNAs and their functional role in virus-host interactions are still limited. Here, we identified and characterized the lncRNAs in the genome of an arbovirus vector, Ae. albopictus, and evaluated their potential involvement in DENV and ZIKV infection. We used 148 public datasets, and identified a total of 10, 867 novel lncRNA transcripts, of which 5,809, 4,139, and 919 were intergenic, intronic and antisense respectively. The Ae. albopictus lncRNAs shared many characteristics with other species such as short length, low GC content, and low sequence conservation. RNA-sequencing of Ae. albopictus cells infected with DENV and ZIKV showed that the expression of lncRNAs was altered upon virus infection. Target prediction analysis revealed that Ae. albopictus lncRNAs may regulate the expression of genes involved in immunity and other metabolic and cellular processes. To verify the role of lncRNAs in virus infection, we generated mutation in lncRNA loci using CRISPR-Cas9, and discovered that two lncRNA loci mutations, namely XLOC_029733 (novel lncRNA transcript id: lncRNA_27639.2) and LOC115270134 (known lncRNA transcript id: XR_003899061.1) resulted in enhancement of DENV and ZIKV replication. The results presented here provide an important foundation for future studies of lncRNAs and their relationship with virus infection in Ae. albopictus. Author summary Ae. albopictus is an important vector of arboviruses such as dengue and Zika. Studies on virus-host interaction at gene expression and molecular level are crucial especially in devising methods to inhibit virus replication in Aedes mosquito. Previous reports showed that, besides protein-coding genes, noncoding RNAs such as lncRNAs are also involved in virus-host interaction. In this study, we report a comprehensive catalog of novel lncRNA transcripts in the genome of Ae. albopictus. We also show that the expression of lncRNAs was altered upon infection with dengue and Zika. Additionally, depletion of certain lncRNAs resulted in increased replication of dengue and Zika; hence, suggesting potential association of lncRNAs in virus infection. Results of this study provide a new avenue to the investigation of mosquito-virus interactions that may potentially pave way to the development of novel methods in vector control.

AB  - Dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are recurrent diseases that are widespread in the tropics. Here, we identified candidate genes associated with these diseases by performing integrated analyses of DF (GSE51808) and DHF (GSE18090) microarray datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). In all, we identified 7635 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DF and 8147 DEGs in DHF as compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05). In addition, we discovered 215 differentially expressed long non‐coding RNAs (DElncRNAs) in DF and 225 DElncRNAs in DHF. There were 1256 common DEGs and eight common DElncRNAs in DHF vs DF, DHF vs normal control, and DF vs normal control groups. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that signal transduction (false discovery rate = 8.33E‐10), ‘toxoplasmosis’, and ‘protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum’ were significantly enriched pathways for common DEGs. We conclude that the MAGED1,STAT1, and IL12A genes may play crucial roles in DF and DHF, and suggest that our findings may facilitate the identification of biomarkers and the development of new drug design strategies for DF and DHF treatment.

TI  - Glutathionylation of dengue and Zika NS5 proteins affects guanylyltransferase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase activities
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 13
AB  - It has been estimated for dengue infection that the global population at risk is 3.5 billion people, which makes dengue an important public health problem. The causative agents of dengue are dengue viruses. For dengue virus replication, the dengue virus NS5 protein is of special importance as it has several enzyme activities important for viral replication. Previous reports of phosphorylation and SUMOylation of dengue NS5 have shown these protein modifications have important consequences for NS5 functions. In this report we identify glutathionylation, another reversible post translation modification that impacts on NS5 enzyme activity. Using dengue virus infected cells we employed specific antibodies and mass spectrometry to identify 3 cysteine residues of NS5 protein as being glutathionylated. Glutathionylation is a post translational protein modification where glutathione is covalently attached to a cysteine residue. We showed glutathionylation occurs on 3 conserved cysteine residues of dengue NS5. Then we generated two flavivirus recombinant full length proteins, dengue NS5 and Zika NS5, to characterize two of the NS5 enzyme activities, namely, guanylyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities. We show glutathionylation of dengue and Zika NS5 affects enzyme activities of the two flavivirus proteins. The data suggests that glutathionylation is a general feature of the flavivirus NS5 protein and the modification has the potential to modulate several of the NS5 enzyme functions.

TI  - Glycerophospholipid remodeling is critical for orthoflavivirus infection
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 15
AB  - Flavivirus infection is tightly connected to host lipid metabolism. Here, we performed shotgun lipidomics of cells infected with neurotropic Zika, West Nile, and tick-borne encephalitis virus, as well as dengue and yellow fever virus. Early in infection specific lipids accumulate, e.g., neutral lipids in Zika and some lysophospholipids in all infections. Ceramide levels increase following infection with viruses that cause a cytopathic effect. In addition, fatty acid desaturation as well as glycerophospholipid metabolism are significantly altered. Importantly, depletion of enzymes involved in phosphatidylserine metabolism as well as phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis reduce orthoflavivirus titers and cytopathic effects while inhibition of fatty acid monounsaturation only rescues from virus-induced cell death. Interestingly, interfering with ceramide synthesis has opposing effects on virus replication and cytotoxicity depending on the targeted enzyme. Thus, lipid remodeling by orthoflaviviruses includes distinct changes but also common patterns shared by several viruses that are needed for efficient infection and replication.

TI  - Glycogen synthase kinase 3ß participates in late stages of Dengue virus-2 infection
JF  - Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz
VL  - 115
AB  - BACKGROUND Viruses can modulate intracellular signalling pathways to complete their infectious cycle. Among these, the PI3K/Akt pathway allows prolonged survival of infected cells that favours viral replication. GSK3β, a protein kinase downstream of PI3K/Akt, gets inactivated upon activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, and its association with viral infections has been recently established. In this study, the role of GSK3β during Dengue virus-2 (DENV-2) infection was investigated. METHODS GSK3β participation in the DENV-2 replication process was evaluated with pharmacological and genetic inhibition during early [0-12 h post-infection (hpi)], late (12-24 hpi), and 24 hpi in Huh7 and Vero cells. We assessed the viral and cellular processes by calculating the viral titre in the supernatants, In-Cell Western, western blotting and fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS Phosphorylation of GSK3β-Ser9 was observed at the early stages of infection; neither did treatment with small molecule inhibitors nor pre-treatment prior to viral infection of GSK3β reduce viral titres of the supernatant at these time points. However, a decrease in viral titres was observed in cells infected and treated with the inhibitors much later during viral infection. Consistently, the infected cells at this stage displayed plasma membrane damage. Nonetheless, these effects were not elicited with the use of genetic inhibitors of GSK3β. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that GSK3β participates at the late stages of the DENV replication cycle, where viral activation may promote apoptosis and release of viral particles.

TI  - Glycogen synthetase kinase 3 inhibition drives MIC‐A/B to promote cytokine production by human natural killer cells in Dengue virus type 2 infection
JF  - European Journal of Immunology
VL  - 50
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most widespread arbovirus worldwide and is responsible for major outbreaks. The host's immune response plays a crucial role in controlling this infection but might also contribute to the promotion of viral spread and immunopathology. In response to DENV infection, NK cells preferentially produce cytokines and are cytotoxic in the presence of specific antibodies. Here, we identified that DENV‐2 inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK‐3) activity to subsequently induce MHC class‐1‐related chain (MIC) A and MIC‐B expression and IL‐12 production in monocyte‐derived DCs, independently of the STAT‐3 pathway. The inhibition of GSK‐3 by DENV‐2 or small molecules induced MIC‐A/B expression on monocyte‐derived DCs, resulting in autologous NK cells of a specific increase in IFN‐γ and TNF‐α production, in the absence of direct cytotoxicity. Together, these findings identified GSK‐3 as a regulator of MIC‐A/B expression and suggested its role in DENV‐2 infection to specifically induce cytokine production by NK cells.

TI  - Glycolysis is reduced in dengue virus 2 infected liver cells
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 14
AB  - Infections with dengue virus (DENV) remain a worldwide public health problem. A number of bona fide cellular targets of DENV have been identified including liver cells. Despite the many lines of evidence confirming the involvement of hepatocytes during DENV infection, only a few studies have used proteomic analysis to understand the modulation of the cellular proteome occurring upon DENV infection. We utilized a 2D-gel electrophoresis analysis to identify proteins that were differentially regulated by DENV 2 infection of liver (Hep3B) cells at 12 h post infection (hpi) and at 48 hpi. The analysis identifies 4 proteins differentially expressed at 12 hpi, and 14 differentially regulated at 48 hpi. One candidate protein identified as downregulated at 48 hpi in the proteomic analysis (GAPDH) was validated in western blotting in Hep3B cells, and subsequently in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived human hepatocytes. The reduced expression of GAPDH was coupled with an increase in NADH, and a significantly reduced NAD + /NADH ratio, strongly suggesting that glycolysis is down regulated in response to DENV 2 infection. Metformin, a well characterized drug used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, is an inhibitor of hepatic gluconeogenesis was shown to reduce the level of DENV 2 infection and new virus production. Collectively these results show that although glycolysis is reduced, glucose is still required, possibly for use by the pentose phosphate pathway to generate nucleosides required for viral replication.

TI  - Glycosphingolipid GM3 is Indispensable for Dengue Virus Genome Replication
JF  - International Journal of Biological Sciences
VL  - 12
SP  - 872
EP  - 883
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease of humans worldwide. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are involved in virus infection by regulating various steps of viral-host interaction. However, the distinct role of GSLs during DENV infection remains unclear. In this study, we used mouse melanoma B16 cells and their GSL-deficient mutant counterpart GM95 cells to study the influence of GSLs on DENV infection. Surprisingly, GM95 cells were highly resistant to DENV infection compared with B16 cells. Pretreatment of B16 cells with synthetase inhibitor of GM3, the most abundant GSLs in B16 cells, or silencing GM3 synthetase T3GAL5, significantly inhibited DENV infection. DENV attachment and endocytosis were not impaired in GM95 cells, but DENV genome replication was obviously inhibited in GM95 cells compared to B16 cells. Furthermore, GM3 was colocalized with DENV viral replication complex on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) inside the B16 cells. Finally, GM3 synthetase inhibitor significantly reduced the mortality rate of suckling mice that challenged with DENV by impairing the viral replication in mouse brain. Taken together, these data indicated that GM3 was not required for DENV attachment and endocytosis, however, essential for viral genome replication. Targeting GM3 could be a novel strategy to inhibit DENV infection.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 75 ( Pt 5)
SP  - 1183
EP  - 7
AB  - The non-structural glycoprotein NS1 of dengue virus type 2 contains sites for N-linked glycosylation at Asn-130 and Asn-207. NS1 synthesized in infected cells is glycosylated at both locations. We have now examined the dimerization and secretion of NS1 lacking one or both of these sites by transient expression of mutagenized cDNA inserted into a simian virus 40-based vector. Immunoblotting and radioimmunoprecipitation were used to detect NS1 associated with transfected cells and in the extracellular medium. Elimination of one or both glycosylation sites did not abolish dimerization and secretion of NS1. However, NS1 lacking Asn-207 showed reduced dimer stability and secretion. Treatment of secreted NS1 with endoglycosidase H demonstrated that complex glycans were attached at Asn-130 and high-mannose glycans at Asn-207.

JF  - Virulence
VL  - 13

EP  - 683
AB  - ABSTRACT Glycans are among the most important cell molecular components. However, given their structural diversity, their functions have not been fully explored. Glycosylation is a vital post-translational modification for various proteins. Many bacteria and viruses rely on N-linked and O-linked glycosylation to perform critical biological functions. The diverse functions of glycosylation on viral proteins during viral infections, including Dengue, Zika, influenza, and human immunodeficiency viruses as well as coronaviruses have been reported. N-linked glycosylation is the most common form of protein modification, and it modulates folding, transportation and receptor binding. Compared to N-linked glycosylation, the functions of O-linked viral protein glycosylation have not been comprehensively evaluated. In this review, we summarize findings on viral protein glycosylation, with particular attention to studies on N-linked glycosylation in viral life cycles. This review informs the development of virus-specific vaccines or inhibitors.

AB  - Mosquito-borne viruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV), are global threats that continue to infect millions annually. Historically, efforts to combat the spread of these diseases have sought to eradicate the mosquito population. This has had limited success. Recent efforts to combat the spread of these diseases have targeted the mosquito population and the mosquito's ability to transmit viruses by altering the mosquito's microbiome. The introduction of particular strains of Wolbachia bacteria into mosquitos suppresses viral growth and blocks disease transmission. This novel strategy is being tested worldwide to reduce DENV and has early indications of success. The Wolbachia genus comprised divergent strains that are divided in major phylogenetic clades termed supergroups. All Wolbachia field trials currently utilize supergroup A Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti mosquitos to limit virus transmission. Here we discuss our studies of Wolbachia strains not yet used in virus control strategies but that show strong potential to reduce ZIKV replication. These strains are important opportunities in the search for novel tools to reduce the levels of mosquito-borne viruses and provide additional models for mechanistic studies.

JF  - Intervirology
VL  - 49
SP  - 161
EP  - 172
AB  - Objectives: Although dengue is one of the most common mosquito-borne viral diseases, few studies have investigated the relationship between the dengue virus and mosquito cells, and this study sought to describe the binding and propagation of the dengue viruses in C6/36 cells. Methods: The internalization and production of the dengue virus was assayed by standard plaque assay methodologies, while dengue virus receptor proteins were examined by a virus overlay protein-binding assay and candidate gene analysis coupled with virus inhibition studies. Results: All four serotypes were internalized linearly, and de novo virus production occurred 14–19 h postinfection. Virus overlay protein-binding assay identified a band of 50 kDa for dengue serotypes 2, 3 and 4 which comigrated with a protein that reacts with antibodies directed against the human 37/67-kDa high-affinity laminin receptor. Both antibodies directed against the human 37/67-kDa high-affinity laminin receptor protein and soluble laminin inhibited the binding and internalization of serotypes 3 and 4, but not serotypes 1 and 2. Conclusions: The results suggest that multiple receptors may be used by the dengue virus to enter into insect cells, and that one of these proteins may be a laminin-binding protein.

TI  - Growth-restricted dengue virus mutants containing deletions in the 5' noncoding region of the RNA genome.
JF  - Virology
VL  - 207 1
SP  - 68
EP  - 76
AB  - The dengue type 4 virus (DEN4) RNA genome contains a 101-nt 5' noncoding (NC) sequence which is predicted to form a stable secondary structure. DEN4 cDNA from which infectious RNA can be transcribed was used to engineer deletions in the 5' NC region for functional analysis of RNA structure and for isolation of DEN4 mutants that could be evaluated as candidates for use in a live attenuated vaccine. Eleven distinct deletions in the region of the DEN4 genome between nts 18 and 98 were constructed; each mutation was predicted to alter or disrupt the local base-parings in the 5' NC RNA structure. An infectious virus was not recovered from the RNA transcripts of five of these deletion mutants. Significantly, four of the five apparently lethal deletions were located in a 5- to 6-nt base-paired region of a predicted long stem or adjacent to it. In contrast, with one exception, mutants which yielded infectious virus had deletions which were located in a loop or short stem region. The effect of the deletions on the efficiency of translation of viral RNA transcripts was examined in vitro. The RNA transcripts of deletion constructs which did not yield viable virus were translated at an efficiency ranging from 40 to 160% that of wild-type virus transcripts. The translation efficiency of infectious RNA transcripts also varied. Deletion mutants recovered from RNA transcripts that exhibited low to moderate efficiency of translation had a small plaque morphology and exhibited reduced growth in simian LLC-MK2 and mosquito C6/36 cells compared to the wild-type virus. Among the 11 mutant constructs, deletion of nts 82-87 caused the greatest reduction in translation efficiency. Nevertheless, an infectious virus was recovered from LLC-MK2 cells transfected with the RNA transcripts of mutant d(82-87). The progeny of this mutant produced small plaques on LLC-MK2 cells and grew to low titer in these cells. Unlike wild-type DEN4 or other DEN4 deletion mutants tested, mutant d(82-87) failed to produce plaques on C6/36 cells and was also replication-defective in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus following intrathoracic inoculation.

TI  - Guanylate-binding protein 1 participates in cellular antiviral response to dengue virus
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 9
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), the causative agent of human Dengue hemorrhagic fever, is a mosquito-borne virus found in tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world. Vaccines against DENV are currently unavailable. Guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) is one of the Interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs) and has been shown important for host immune defense against various pathogens. However, the role of GBP1 during DENV infection remains unclarified. In this study, we evaluated the relevance of GBP1 to DENV infection in in vitro model. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot showed that the expression of mouse Gbp1 was dramatically upregulated in DENV-infected RAW264.7 cells. The intracellular DENV loads were significantly higher in Gbp1 silenced cells compared with controls. The expression levels of selective anti-viral cytokines were decreased in Gbp1 siRNA treated cells, while the transcription factor activity of NF-κB was impaired upon GBP1 silencing during infection. Our data suggested that GBP1 plays an antiviral role during DENV infection.

TI  - HEPARAN SULFATE: LANDING SITE FOR THE DENGUE VIRAL STRAINS TO GAIN ENTRY TO THE HOST CELLS
JF  - Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research
AB  - Humans usually contract dengue by being bitten by arthropods, and more than 3.6 billion people are at risk per year. Although studies are conducted to screen and trace out the possible pathophysiology of the virus, an adequate receptor-based study has not been completed. Understanding how the dengue virus (DV) engraves its landing sites requires identification of such cellular receptors. In many model studies, heparan sulfate (HS) has been reported to act as a DV receptor under various conditions. However, the physiological relevance of these findings remains uncertain. Therefore, it is still unclear whether HS is used by viral strains or not, and if at all used by clinical or non-cell culture-adapted strains of DV. The present review aims to identify relevant experimental evidences that confirm the possible interaction between envelope protein and HS chains. We collected data from a series of studies to conclude the interactive role.

TI  - HLA Class I Supertype Associations With Clinical Outcome of Secondary Dengue Virus Infections in Ethnic Thais.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 212 6
SP  - 939
EP  - 47
AB  - BACKGROUND
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) supertypes are groups of functionally related alleles that present structurally similar antigens to the immune system.


OBJECTIVES
To analyze HLA class I supertype associations with clinical outcome in hospitalized Thai children with acute dengue illness.


METHODS
Seven hundred sixty-two patients and population-matched controls recruited predominantly in Bangkok were HLA-A and -B typed. HLA supertype frequencies were compared and tested for significant dengue disease associations using logistic regression analyses. Multivariable models were built by conducting forward stepwise selection procedures.


RESULTS
In the final logistic regression model, the HLA-B44 supertype was protective against dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in secondary infections (odds ratio [OR] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI], .30-.72), while the HLA-A02 supertype (OR = 1.92, 95% CI, 1.30-2.83) and the HLA-A01/03 supertype (OR = 3.01, 95% CI, 1.01-8.92) were associated with susceptibility to secondary dengue fever. The B07 supertype was associated with susceptibility to secondary DHF in the univariate analysis (OR = 1.60, 95% CI, 1.05-2.46), whereas that was not retained in the final model.


CONCLUSIONS
As the HLA-B44 supertype is predicted to target conserved epitopes in dengue, our results suggest that B44 supertype-restricted immune responses to highly conserved regions of the dengue proteome may protect against secondary DHF.

TI  - HLA Class I and Class II Associations in Dengue Viral Infections in a Sri Lankan Population
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 6
AB  - Background HLA class I and class II alleles have been shown to be associated with the development of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in different populations. However, the majority of studies have been based on limited numbers of patients. In this study we aimed to investigate the HLA-class I and class II alleles that are positively and negatively associated with the development of DSS in a cohort of patients with DHF and also the alleles associated with development of DHF during primary dengue infections in a Sri Lankan population. Methodology/Principal Findings The allele frequencies of HLA class I and class II alleles were compared in 110 patients with DHF and 119 individuals from the population who had never reported a symptomatic dengue infection at the time of recruitment. We found that HLA-A*31 (corrected P = 0.01) and DRB1*08 (corrected P = 0.009) were associated with susceptibility to DSS when infected with the dengue virus, during secondary dengue infection. The frequency of DRB1*08 allele was 28.7 times higher than in the normal population in patients with DSS. HLA-A*31 allele was increased 16.6 fold in DHF who developed shock when compared to those who did not develop shock. A*24 (corrected P = 0.03) and DRB1*12 (corrected P = 0.041) were strongly associated with the development of DHF during primary dengue infection. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that certain HLA alleles confer susceptibility/protection to severe dengue infections. As T cell epitope recognition depend on the HLA type of an individual, it would be now important to investigate how epitope specific T cells associate with primary and secondary dengue infections and in severe dengue infections.

TI  - HLA Upregulation During Dengue Virus Infection Suppresses the Natural Killer Cell Response
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 9
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus in the world and a major cause of morbidity in the tropics and subtropics. Upregulation of HLA class I molecules has long been considered a feature of DENV infection, yet this has not been evaluated in the setting of natural infection. Natural killer (NK) cells, an innate immune cell subset critical for mounting an early response to viral infection, are inhibited by self HLA class I, suggesting that upregulation of HLA class I during DENV infection could dampen the NK cell response. Here we addressed whether upregulation of HLA class I molecules occurs during in vivo DENV infection and, if so, whether this suppresses the NK cell response. We found that HLA class I expression was indeed upregulated during acute DENV infection across multiple cell lineages in vivo. To better understand the role of HLA class I upregulation, we infected primary human monocytes, a major target of DENV infection, in vitro. Upregulation of total HLA class I is dependent on active viral replication and is mediated in part by cytokines and other soluble factors induced by infection, while upregulation of HLA-E occurs in the presence of replication-incompetent virus. Importantly, blocking DENV-infected monocytes with a pan-HLA class I Fab nearly doubles the frequency of degranulating NK cells, while blocking HLA-E does not significantly improve the NK cell response. These findings demonstrate that upregulation of HLA class I during DENV infection suppresses the NK cell response, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis.

TI  - HLA-A and -B allele associations with secondary dengue virus infections correlate with disease severity and the infecting viral serotype in ethnic Thais.
JF  - Tissue antigens
VL  - 60 4

EP  - 18
AB  - Little is known of the role of classical HLA-A and -B class I alleles in determining resistance, susceptibility, or the severity of acute viral infections. Appropriate paradigms for immunogenetic studies of acute viral infections are dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Both primary and secondary infections with dengue virus (DEN) serotypes 1, 2, 3 or 4, can result in either clinically less severe DF or the more severe DHF. In secondary exposures, a memory response is induced in immunologically primed individuals, which can both clear the infecting dengue virus and contribute to its pathology. In a case-control study of 263 ethnic Thai patients infected with either DEN-1, -2, -3 or -4, we detected HLA class I associations with secondary infections, but not in immunologically naive patients with primary infections. HLA-A*0203 was associated with the less severe DF, regardless of the secondary infecting virus serotype. By contrast, HLA-A*0207 was associated with susceptibility to the more severe DHF in patients with secondary DEN-1 and DEN-2 infections only. Conversely, HLA-B*51 was associated with the development of DHF in patients with secondary infections, and HLA-B*52 was associated with DF in patients with secondary DEN-1 and DEN-2 infections. Moreover, HLA-B44, B62, B76 and B77 also appeared to be protective against developing clinical disease after secondary dengue virus infection. These results confirm that classical HLA class I alleles are associated with the clinical outcome of exposure to dengue virus, in previously exposed and immunologically primed individuals.

TI  - HLA-A*01 allele: a risk factor for dengue haemorrhagic fever in Brazil's population.
JF  - Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz
VL  - 107 2
SP  - 224
EP  - 30
AB  - Severe forms of dengue, such as dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome, are examples of a complex pathogenic mechanism in which the virus, environment and host immune response interact. The influence of the host's genetic predisposition to susceptibility or resistance to infectious diseases has been evidenced in several studies. The association of the human leukocyte antigen gene (HLA) class I alleles with DHF susceptibility or resistance has been reported in ethnically and geographically distinct populations. Due to these ethnic and viral strain differences, associations occur in each population, independently with a specific allele, which most likely explains the associations of several alleles with DHF. As the potential role of HLA alleles in the progression of DHF in Brazilian patients remains unknown, we then identified HLA-A alleles in 67 patients with dengue fever and 42 with DHF from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, selected from 2002-2008 by the sequence-based typing technique. Statistical analysis revealed an association between the HLA-A*01 allele and DHF [odds ratio (OR) = 2.7, p = 0.01], while analysis of the HLA-A*31 allele (OR = 0.5, p = 0.11) suggested a potential protective role in DHF that should be further investigated. This study provides evidence that HLA class I alleles might be important risk factors for DHF in Brazilian patients.

TI  - HLA-A*33:01 as Protective Allele for Severe Dengue in a Population of Filipino Children
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue virus infection is a leading cause of morbidity among children in the Philippines in recent years. In order to investigate the association of HLA Class I and II alleles and dengue disease severity in a cohort of Filipino children, we performed a case control study in 2 hospitals in Metro Manila from June 2008 to December 2009. A total of 250 laboratory confirmed dengue patients and 300 healthy individuals aged 5 to 15 years old were typed for HLA-A, B and DRB1 alleles. The frequency of HLA-A*33:01 was significantly decreased in severe dengue (DHF/ DSS; Pc = 0.0016)) and DSS (Pc = 0.0032) compared to the background population. These findings support a previous study that this allele may confer protection against the severe form of dengue and provide the first evidence of HLA association with dengue in the Philippines. Future studies should be directed in investigating the possible mechanisms of protection.

AB  - Dengue virus infection (DEN) is one of the most prevalent arbovirus diseases in the tropical and subtropical areas. Some human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have been reported to be a protective or risk factor to DEN. Due to the limited sample sizes and regional limitations, the results of individual studies were various. This meta-analysis aimed at investigating the relationship between HLA alleles and dengue disease. Relevant studies of the relationship between HLA and dengue disease were searched through PubMed, Embase, Web of science, and Cochrane databases. Subgroups according to ethnicity or sub-alleles and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the potential source of heterogeneity, which was performed to confirm the findings. The relationships between HLA and dengue disease were defined by odds ratios (ORs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Fourteen studies were finally confirmed. Results indicated that A*0203 (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.30-3.69) and A*24 in the Asian group (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.21-1.71) were positively associated with an increased risk of DEN when compared with normal controls. A*33 (OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.34-0.69) in Southeast Asia was negatively associated with DEN when compared with normal controls, suggesting a protective role against DEN. In addition, DRB1*11 (OR = 4.10, 95% CI = 1.23-13.69) was positively associated with severe dengue (SD) when compared with dengue fever, whereas DRB1*03 (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.28-0.82) and DRB1*09 (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.55-0.96) were negatively associated with SD when compared with normal controls. The meta-analysis confirmed that HLA-A*0203, A*24, A*33, DRB1*03, DRB1*09, and DRB1*11 have significantly affected dengue disease, and the associations are related to race and regions.

TI  - HLA-B∗44 Is Associated with Dengue Severity Caused by DENV-3 in a Brazilian Population
JF  - Journal of Tropical Medicine
VL  - 2013
AB  - Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have been correlated with susceptibility or resistance to severe dengue; however, few immunogenetic studies have been performed in Latin American (LA) populations. We have conducted immunogenetic studies of HLA class I and II alleles in a cohort of 187 patients with DENV-3 infection and confirmed clinical diagnosis of either severe dengue, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), or the less severe form, dengue fever (DF), in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. An association analysis was performed using Fisher's association test, with odds ratios (ORs) calculated using conditional maximum likelihood estimates. HLA-B∗44 (P = 0.047, OR = 2.025, 95% CI = 0.97–4.24) was found to be associated with increased susceptibility to DHF in response to DENV-3 infection. In addition, HLA-B∗07 (P = 0.048, OR = 0.501, one-sided 95% CI = 0–0.99) and HLA-DR∗13 (P = 0.028, OR = 0.511, one-sided 95% CI = 0–0.91) were found to be associated with resistance to secondary dengue infection by DENV-3. These results suggest that HLA-B∗44 supertype alleles and their respective T-cell responses might be involved in susceptibility to severe dengue infections, whereas the HLA-B∗07 supertype alleles and DR∗13 might be involved in cross-dengue serotype immunity.

TI  - HLA-DRB1 Alleles Are Associated With Different Magnitudes of Dengue Virus-Specific CD4+ T-Cell Responses.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 214 7
SP  - 1117
EP  - 24
AB  - BACKGROUND
Each year dengue virus (DENV) infects 400 million human but causes symptomatic disease in only a subset of patients, suggesting that host genetic factors may play a role. HLA molecules that restrict T-cell responses are one of the most polymorphic host factors in humans.


METHODS
Here we map HLA DRB1-restricted DENV-specific epitopes in individuals previously exposed to DENV, to identify the breadth and specificity of CD4(+) T-cell responses. To investigate whether HLA-specific variations in the magnitude of response might predict associations between dengue outcomes and HLA-DRB1 alleles, we assembled samples from hospitalized patients with known severity of disease.


RESULTS
The capsid protein followed by nonstructural protein 3 (NS3), NS2A, and NS5 were the most targeted proteins. We further noticed a wide variation in magnitude of T-cell responses as a function of the restricting DRB1 allele and found several HLA alleles that showed trends toward a lower risk of hospitalized disease were associated with a higher magnitude of T-cell responses.


CONCLUSIONS
Comprehensive identification of unique CD4(+) T-cell epitopes across the 4 DENV serotypes allows the testing of T-cell responses by use of a simple, approachable technique and points to important implications for vaccine design.

TI  - Harnessing Wolbachia to Reduce Dengue Transmission - a Review
JF  - Indian Journal of Entomology
AB  - In this article, we discuss the possible, underlying molecular and biological basis of dengue case reduction by Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, their field releases trial, and mathematical modelling of reduction in transmission of DENV attributable to the presence of Wolbachia. This study suggests that Wolbachia-infected DENV control could reduce dengue incidences up to 40.3 to 96% in the field release sites and A laboratory-based trial reported 100% suppression when Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes were released. Moreover, Mathematical modeling predicted promising results in dengue reduction by Wolbachia. Documented evidence in this study support Wolbachia as a novel vector control approach to limit dengue transmission.

TI  - Harnessing engineered symbionts to combat concurrent malaria and arboviruses transmission
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 16
AB  - Concurrent malaria and arbovirus infections pose significant public health challenges in tropical and subtropical regions, demanding innovative control strategies. Here, we describe a strategy that employs multifunctional engineered symbiotic bacteria to suppress concurrent transmission of malaria parasites, dengue, and Zika viruses by various vector mosquitoes. The symbiotic bacterium Serratia AS1, which efficiently spreads through Anopheles and Aedes populations, is engineered to simultaneously produce anti-Plasmodium and anti-arbovirus effector proteins controlled by a selected blood-induced promoter. Laboratory and outdoor field-cage studies show that the multifunctional engineered symbiotic strains effectively inhibit Plasmodium infection in Anopheles mosquitoes and arbovirus infection in Aedes mosquitoes. Our findings provide the foundation for the use of engineered symbiotic bacteria as a powerful tool to combat the concurrent transmission of malaria and arbovirus diseases.

TI  - Heat Shock Protein 90 and Heat Shock Protein 70 Are Components of Dengue Virus Receptor Complex in Human Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 4557
EP  - 4567
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus requires the presence of an unidentified cellular receptor on the surface of the host cell. By using a recently published affinity chromatography approach, an 84-kDa molecule, identified as heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, was isolated from neuroblastoma and U937 cells. Based on the ability of HSP90 (84 kDa) to interact with HSP70 (74 kDa) on the surface of monocytes during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling and evidence that LPS inhibits dengue virus infection, the presence of HSP70 was demonstrated in affinity chromatography eluates and by pull-down experiments. Infection inhibition assays support the conclusion that HSP90 and HSP70 participate in dengue virus entry as a receptor complex in human cell lines as well as in monocytes/macrophages. Additionally, our results indicate that both HSPs are associated with membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) in response to dengue virus infection. Moreover, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, a raft-disrupting drug, inhibits dengue virus infection, supporting the idea that cholesterol-rich membrane fractions are important in dengue virus entry.

TI  - Heme oxygenase‐1 inhibits DENV‐induced endothelial hyperpermeability and serves as a potential target against dengue hemorrhagic fever
JF  - The FASEB Journal
VL  - 36
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a cause of vascular endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage, which are characterized as hallmarks of dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome, which become a severe global health emergency with substantial morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are still no promising therapeutics to alleviate the dengue‐associated vascular hemorrhage in a clinical setting. In the present study, we first observed that heme oxygenase‐1 (HO‐1) expression level was highly suppressed in severe DENV‐infected patients. In contrast, the overexpression of HO‐1 could attenuate DENV‐induced pathogenesis, including plasma leakage and thrombocytopenia, in an AG129 mouse model. Our data indicate that overexpression of HO‐1 or its metabolite biliverdin can maintain endothelial integrity upon DENV infection in vitro and in vivo. We further characterized the positive regulatory effect of HO‐1 on the endothelial adhesion factor vascular endothelial‐cadherin to decrease DENV‐induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Subsequently, we confirmed that two medicinal plant‐derived compounds, andrographolide, and celastrol, widely used as a nutritional or medicinal supplement are useful to attenuate DENV‐induced plasma leakage through induction of the HO‐1 expression in DENV‐infected AG129 mice. In conclusion, our findings reveal that induction of the HO‐1 signal pathway is a promising option for the treatment of DENV‐induced vascular pathologies.

TI  - Heparan sulfate proteoglycans initiate dengue virus infection of hepatocytes
JF  - Hepatology
VL  - 32
AB  - Dengue viruses (DEN) cause a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations including potentially life‐threatening conditions such as hemorrhagic shock syndrome and less frequently acute hepatitis with liver failure and encephalopathy. In addition, dengue viruses provide a potential model to understand the initiation of hepatocyte infection by the structurally closely related hepatitis C virus (HCV), because this virus at present cannot be grown in cell culture. Although the initial steps of viral infection are a critical determinant of tissue tropism and therefore pathogenesis, little is known about the molecular basis of binding and endocytic trafficking of DEN or of any other flavivirus. Our studies revealed that binding of radiolabeled DEN to the human hepatoma cell line HuH‐7 was strictly pH dependent and substantially inhibitable by the glycosaminoglycan heparin. Ligand‐blot analysis, performed as a viral overlay assay, showed two heparan sulfate (HS) containing cell‐surface binding proteins resolving at 33 and 37 kd. Based on the sensitivity of unprotected virus and the viral binding site on the cell surface to trypsin, viral internalization was quantified as an increase in trypsin protected virus over time. Virus trafficking to the site of degradation was inhibited by pH dissociation of the clathrin coat and dependent on IP3‐mediated homotypic endosomal fusion. These findings confirm the hypothesis that binding and internalization of DEN by hepatocytes are mediated primarily by HS containing proteoglycans and suggest that flaviviruses traffic the major clathrin‐dependent endocytic pathway during infection.

JF  - Virology
VL  - 292 1
SP  - 162
EP  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus type 2 and Yellow fever virus are arthropod-borne flaviviruses causing hemorrhagic fever in humans. Identification of virus receptors is important in understanding flavivirus pathogenesis. The aim of this work was to study the role of cellular heparan sulfate in the adsorption of infectious Yellow fever and Dengue type 2 viruses. Virus attachment was assessed by adsorbing virus to cells, washing unbound virus away, releasing cell-bound virus by freezing/thawing, and then titrating the released infectious virus. Treatment of cells by heparin-lyase, desulfation of cellular heparan sulfate, or treatment of the virus with heparin inhibited cell binding of both viruses. Heparin also inhibited Yellow fever virus infection by 97%. Using infectious virus, the present work shows the importance of heparan sulfate in binding and infection of these two flaviviruses.

TI  - High Anti-Dengue Virus Activity of the OAS Gene Family Is Associated With Increased Severity of Dengue.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 212 12
SP  - 2011
EP  - 20
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that afflicts millions of individuals worldwide every year. Infection by any of the 4 dengue virus (DENV) serotypes can result in a spectrum of disease severity. We investigated the impact of variants of interferon-regulated innate immunity genes with a potent antiviral effect on the outcome of DENV infection. We compared the effect of OAS gene family variants on 2 DENV serotypes in cell culture. While both OAS1-p42 and p46 showed antiviral activity against DENV-2, only OAS1-p42 presented anti-DENV-1 activity. Conversely, whereas both OAS3_S381 and R381 variants were able to block DENV-1 infection, the anti-DENV-2 activity observed for OAS3_S381 was largely lost for the R381 variant. By means of an allelic association study of a cohort of 740 patients with dengue, we found a protective effect of OAS3_R381 against shock (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; P < .001). This effect was due to DENV-2 infections (OR, 0.13; P = .007) but was absent for DENV-1, in accordance with the serotype-dependent OAS3 activity found in the functional study. Severe dengue has long been associated with a cytokine storm of unclear origin. This work identifies an early innate immunity process that could lead to the immune overreaction observed in severe dengue and could be triggered by a specific host genotype-pathogen genotype interaction.

TI  - High Expression of FcγII (CD32) Receptor on Monocytes in Dengue Infected Patients
JF  - The Indonesian Biomedical Journal
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathogenesis of severe dengue infection has not been elucidated. Immune complex of pre-existing antibodies and heterotypic dengue virus bind to FcγII (cluster of differentiation (CD32)) receptor (FcγIIR) on monocyte facilitates entry and replication of dengue virus. Aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of FcγIIR on monocytes in patients infected with dengue and in healthy subjects.METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design that included patients infected with dengue who were hospitalized in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Panembahan Senopati Hospital, and Sleman Hospital, who met the inclusion criteria and selected consecutively. Examinations were completed using a lyse, no-wash method of flow cytometry. Computerized statistical analysis was conducted and was considered to be significant if p<0.05.RESULTS: Sixty-five study subjects were divided into healthy subjects (24 subjects) and patients with dengue infection (41 subjects). There were no significant differences in hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) values between the groups, but differences were found in the number of leukocytes, absolute number of monocytes and platelet count (p<0.001, 0.002 and <0.001, respectively). The mean expression of FcγIIR monocytes in patients with dengue infection (208.77±32.06 median fluorescent intensity (MFI)) and the healthy subjects (124.03±47.76 MFI) with p<0.0001.CONCLUSION: The mean expression of FcγIIR monocytes in patients with dengue infection was higher than in healthy subjects.KEYWORDS: dengue infection, FcγII (CD32) receptor monocyte, flow cytometry

JF  - International Journal of Medical Sciences
VL  - 12
SP  - 177
EP  - 186
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection usually presents with mild self-limiting dengue fever (DF). Few however, would present with the more severe form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). In the present study, the association between IL-12B, IL-10 and TNF-α gene polymorphisms and dengue severity was investigated. Methods: A case-control study was performed on a total of 120 unrelated controls, 86 DF patients and 196 DHF/DSS patients. The polymorphisms in IL-12B, IL-10 and TNF-α genes were genotyped using PCR-RFLP and PCR-sequencing methods. Results: A protective association of TNF-α -308A allele and -308GA genotype against DHF/DSS was observed, while TNF-α -238A allele and -238GA genotype were associated with DHF/DSS. A combination of TNF-α -308GA+AA genotype and IL-10 non-GCC haplotypes, IL-12B pro homozygotes (pro1/pro1, pro2/pro2) and IL-12B 3'UTR AC were significantly correlated with protective effects against DHF/DSS. An association between the cytokine gene polymorphisms and protection against the clinical features of severe dengue including thrombocytopenia and increased liver enzymes was observed in this study. Conclusion: The overall findings of the study support the correlation of high-producer TNF-α genotypes combined with low-producer IL-10 haplotypes and IL-12B genotypes in reduced risk of DHF/DSS.

AB  - Infection with any 1 of 4 dengue viruses produces a spectrum of clinical illness ranging from a mild undifferentiated febrile illness to dengue fever (DF) to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), a potentially life-threatening disease. The morbidity and mortality of DHF can be reduced by early hospitalization and careful supportive care. To determine its usefulness as a predictor of DHF, plasma levels of the secreted dengue virus nonstructural protein NS1 (sNS1) were measured daily in 32 children with dengue-2 virus infections participating in a prospective, hospital-based study. Free sNS1 levels in plasma correlated with viremia levels and were higher in patients with DHF than in those with DF. An elevated free sNS1 level (> or =600 ng/mL) within 72 h of illness onset identified patients at risk for developing DHF.

TI  - High dengue virus load differentially modulates human microvascular endothelial barrier function during early infection.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 98 12
SP  - 2993
EP  - 3007
AB  - Plasma leakage is the main pathophysiological feature in severe dengue, resulting from altered vascular barrier function associated with an inappropriate immune response triggered upon infection. The present study investigated functional changes using an electric cell-substrate impedance sensing system in four (brain, dermal, pulmonary and retinal) human microvascular endothelial cell (MEC) lines infected with purified dengue virus, followed by assessment of cytokine profiles and the expression of inter-endothelial junctional proteins. Modelling of changes in electrical impedance suggests that vascular leakage in dengue-infected MECs is mostly due to the modulation of cell-to-cell interactions, while this loss of vascular barrier function observed in the infected MECs varied between cell lines and DENV serotypes. High levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α), chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL11, CX3CL1, CCL2 and CCL20) and adhesion molecules (VCAM-1) were differentially produced in the four infected MECs. Further, the tight junctional protein, ZO-1, was down-regulated in both the DENV-1-infected brain and pulmonary MECs, while claudin-1, PECAM-1 and VE-cadherin were differentially expressed in these two MECs after infection. Non-purified virus stock was also studied to investigate the impact of virus stock purity on dengue-specific immune responses, and the results suggest that virus stock propagated through cell culture may include factors that mask or alter the DENV-specific immune responses of the MECs. The findings of the present study show that high DENV load differentially modulates human microvascular endothelial barrier function and disrupts the function of inter-endothelial junctional proteins during early infection with organ-specific cytokine production.

TI  - High resolution proteomics of Aedes aegypti salivary glands infected with either dengue, Zika or chikungunya viruses identify new virus specific and broad antiviral factors
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 11
AB  - Arboviruses such as dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses infect close to half a billion people per year, and are primarily transmitted through Aedes aegypti bites. Infection-induced changes in mosquito salivary glands (SG) influence transmission by inducing antiviral immunity, which restricts virus replication in the vector, and by altering saliva composition, which influences skin infection. Here, we profiled SG proteome responses to DENV serotype 2 (DENV2), ZIKV and CHIKV infections by using high-resolution isobaric-tagged quantitative proteomics. We identified 218 proteins with putative functions in immunity, blood-feeding or related to the cellular machinery. We observed that 58, 27 and 29 proteins were regulated by DENV2, ZIKV and CHIKV infections, respectively. While the regulation patterns were mostly virus-specific, we separately depleted four uncharacterized proteins that were upregulated by all three viral infections to determine their effects on these viral infections. Our study suggests that gamma-interferon responsive lysosomal thiol-like (GILT-like) has an anti-ZIKV effect, adenosine deaminase (ADA) has an anti-CHIKV effect, salivary gland surface protein 1 (SGS1) has a pro-ZIKV effect and salivary gland broad-spectrum antiviral protein (SGBAP) has an antiviral effect against all three viruses. The comprehensive description of SG responses to three global pathogenic viruses and the identification of new restriction factors improves our understanding of the molecular mechanisms influencing transmission.

TI  - High-dimensional CyTOF analysis of dengue virus-infected human DCs reveals distinct viral signatures.
JF  - JCI insight
VL  - 2 13
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus causing human disease. Of the 4 DENV serotypes, epidemiological data suggest that DENV-2 secondary infections are associated with more severe disease than DENV-4 infections. Mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) was used to dissect immune changes induced by DENV-2 and DENV-4 in human DCs, the initial targets of primary infections that likely affect infection outcomes. Strikingly, DENV-4 replication peaked earlier and promoted stronger innate immune responses, with increased expression of DC activation and migration markers and increased cytokine production, compared with DENV-2. In addition, infected DCs produced higher levels of inflammatory cytokines compared with bystander DCs, which mainly produced IFN-induced cytokines. These high-dimensional analyses during DENV-2 and DENV-4 infections revealed distinct viral signatures marked by different replication strategies and antiviral innate immune induction in DCs, which may result in different viral fitness, transmission, and pathogenesis.

TI  - Highly Conserved Residues in the Helical Domain of Dengue Virus Type 1 Precursor Membrane Protein Are Involved in Assembly, Precursor Membrane (prM) Protein Cleavage, and Entry*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 289
SP  - 33149
EP  - 33160
AB  - Background: The role of α-helical domain (MH) of prM protein in DENV replication remains unknown. Results: Alanine substitutions of nine highly conserved MH domain residues affected assembly of replicon particles and entry, which correlated with impairment in prM cleavage. Conclusion: MH domain residues modulate assembly, maturation, and entry. Significance: These highly conserved residues are potential targets of antiviral strategy. The envelope and precursor membrane (prM) proteins of dengue virus (DENV) are present on the surface of immature virions. During maturation, prM protein is cleaved by furin protease into pr peptide and membrane (M) protein. Although previous studies mainly focusing on the pr region have identified several residues important for DENV replication, the functional role of M protein, particularly the α-helical domain (MH), which is predicted to undergo a large conformational change during maturation, remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of nine highly conserved MH domain residues in the replication cycle of DENV by site-directed mutagenesis in a DENV1 prME expression construct and found that alanine substitutions introduced to four highly conserved residues at the C terminus and one at the N terminus of the MH domain greatly affect the production of both virus-like particles and replicon particles. Eight of the nine alanine mutants affected the entry of replicon particles, which correlated with the impairment in prM cleavage. Moreover, seven mutants were found to have reduced prM-E interaction at low pH, which may inhibit the formation of smooth immature particles and exposure of prM cleavage site during maturation, thus contributing to inefficient prM cleavage. Taken together, these results are the first report showing that highly conserved MH domain residues, located at 20–38 amino acids downstream from the prM cleavage site, can modulate the prM cleavage, maturation of particles, and virus entry. The highly conserved nature of these residues suggests potential targets of antiviral strategy.

TI  - Hijacking of Lipid Droplets by Hepatitis C, Dengue and Zika Viruses—From Viral Protein Moonlighting to Extracellular Release
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 21
AB  - Hijacking and manipulation of host cell biosynthetic pathways by human enveloped viruses are essential for the viral lifecycle. Flaviviridae members, including hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses, extensively manipulate host lipid metabolism, underlining the importance of lipid droplets (LDs) in viral infection. LDs are dynamic cytoplasmic organelles that can act as sequestration platforms for a unique subset of host and viral proteins. Transient recruitment and mobilization of proteins to LDs during viral infection impacts host-cell biological properties, LD functionality and canonical protein functions. Notably, recent studies identified LDs in the nucleus and also identified that LDs are transported extracellularly via an autophagy-mediated mechanism, indicating a novel role for autophagy in Flaviviridae infections. These developments underline an unsuspected diversity and localization of LDs and potential moonlighting functions of LD-associated proteins during infection. This review summarizes recent breakthroughs concerning the LD hijacking activities of hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses and potential roles of cytoplasmic, nuclear and extracellular LD-associated viral proteins during infection.

TI  - Hijacking of plasminogen by dengue virus: The kringle‐4 and ‐5 domains of plasminogen binds synergistically to the domain I of envelope protein
JF  - Protein Science : A Publication of the Protein Society
VL  - 34
AB  - Abstract Dengue fever is a serious health issue, particularly in tropical countries like Singapore. We have previously found that dengue virus (DENV) recruits human plasmin in blood meal to enhance the permeability of the mosquito midgut for infection. Here, using biolayer interferometry, we found that neither kringle‐4 nor kringle‐5 plasmin domains alone binds well to dengue virus. However, the domains together lead to a synergistic effect, with both kringle‐4 and ‐5 domains required and sufficient for binding. Site‐directed mutagenesis experiments showed that the N‐terminal and C‐terminal aspartic acid residues in the “DXD” acidic motifs of the kringle‐4 and ‐5 domains likely have different roles when engaged with DENV. Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry experiments on the plasmin:DENV complex led to the identification of two Lys‐containing regions on domain I of the E‐protein of DENV that are buried by plasmin and could be potential plasmin binding sites. These findings contradict with published literature that domain III of the DENV E‐protein interacts with the kringle‐1–3 domains of plasmin. We provide a plausible explanation for the observed discrepancies.

TI  - Hijacking the Host Immune Cells by Dengue Virus: Molecular Interplay of Receptors and Dengue Virus Envelope
JF  - Microorganisms
VL  - 7
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the lethal pathogens in the hot climatic regions of the world and has been extensively studied to decipher its mechanism of pathogenesis and the missing links of its life cycle. With respect to the entry of DENV, multiple receptors have been recognized in different cells of the human body. However, scientists still argue whether these identified receptors are the exclusive entry mediators for the virus. Adding to the complexity, DENV has been reported to be infecting multiple organ types in its human host. Also, more than one receptor in a particular cell has been discerned to take part in mediating the ingress of DENV. In this review, we aim to discuss the different cells of the human immune system that support DENV infection and their corresponding receptors that DENV deploy to gain access to the cells.

TI  - Histidine 39 in the dengue virus type 2 M protein has an important role in virus assembly.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 85 Pt 12
SP  - 3627
EP  - 36
AB  - The mature flavivirus particle comprises a nucleocapsid core surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing the membrane (M) (derived from the precursor prM) and envelope (E) proteins. The formation of intracellular prM/E heterodimers occurs rapidly after translation and is believed to be important for the assembly and secretion of immature virus particles. In this study, the role of the His residue at position 39 in the M protein (M39) of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) in the virus life cycle was investigated. Mutations encoding basic (Arg), non-polar (Leu and Pro) and uncharged polar (Asn, Gln and Tyr) amino acids at M39 were introduced into a DENV-2 genomic-length cDNA clone and their effects on virus replication were examined. Substitution of the His residue with non-polar amino acids abolished virus replication, whereas substitution with basic or uncharged polar amino acids decreased virus replication moderately ( approximately 2 log(10) p.f.u. ml(-1) decrease in viral titre for Arg and Asn) or severely (>3.5 log(10) p.f.u. ml(-1) decrease in viral titre for Gln and Tyr). Selected mutations were introduced into a prM-E gene cassette and expressed transiently in COS cells to investigate whether the mutations impaired prM/E association or secretion. None of the mutations was found to disrupt the formation of intracellular prM/E heterodimers. However, the mutations that abolished virus replication prevented secretion of prM/E complexes. The results of this study pinpoint a critical residue in the M protein that potentially plays a role in viral morphogenesis, secretion and entry.

AB  - Histocompatibility antigen (HLA) A and B typing on lymphocytes from 87 unrelated Thai children who had been hospitalized with dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and/or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) was compared with that found in 138 controls who had not been hospitalized with clinical dengue infection. These data are presented as descriptive information; however, a statistical analysis was performed to identify potentially important relationships for future study. Several deviations (P less than 0.05) were detected in the distribution of four HLA-A and three HLA-B antigens. The prevalence of one HLA-A antigen and two HLA-B antigens appeared to relate to the development of DSS, with a positive association seen for HLA-A2 and HLA-B blank and a negative relationship for HLA-B13. These findings require confirmation, but they do suggest that genetic susceptibility may be important in the development of DHF/DSS and indicate that further broader studies of genetic markers might be rewarding.

TI  - Homologs of Human Dengue-Resistance Genes, FKBP1B and ATCAY, Confer Antiviral Resistance in Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes
JF  - Insects
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted by mosquitoes and is a major public health concern. The study of innate mosquito defense mechanisms against DENV have revealed crucial roles for the Toll, Imd, JAK-STAT, and RNAi pathways in mediating DENV in the mosquito. Often overlooked in such studies is the role of intrinsic cellular defense mechanisms that we hypothesize to work in concert with the classical immune pathways to affect organismal defense. Our understanding of the molecular interaction of DENV with mosquito host cells is limited, and we propose to expand upon the recent results from a genome-scale, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based study that identified mammalian host proteins associated with resistance to dengue/West Nile virus (DENV/WNV) infection. The study identified 22 human DENV/WNV resistance genes (DVR), and we hypothesized that a subset would be functionally conserved in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, imparting cellular defense against flaviviruses in this species. We identified 12 homologs of 22 human DVR genes in the Ae. aegypti genome. To evaluate their possible role in cellular resistance/antiviral defense against DENV, we used siRNA silencing targeted against each of the 12 homologs in an Ae. aegypti cell line (Aag2) infected with DENV2 and identified that silencing of the two candidates, AeFKBP1 and AeATCAY, homologs of human FKBP1B and ATCAY, were associated with a viral increase. We then used dsRNA to silence each of the two genes in adult mosquitoes to validate the observed antiviral functions in vivo. Depletion of AeFKBP1 or AeATCAY increased viral dissemination through the mosquito at 14 days post-infection. Our results demonstrated that AeFKBP1 and AeATCAY mediate resistance to DENV akin to what has been described for their homologs in humans. AeFKBP1 and AeATCAY provide a rare opportunity to elucidate a DENV-resistance mechanism that may be evolutionarily conserved between humans and Ae. aegypti.

SP  - 1167

AB  - The crystal structure coordinates of the hepatitis C virus NS3 protease (HCVpro) were used to develop an homology model of the dengue 2 virus NS3 protease (DEN2pro). The amino acid sequence of DEN2pro accommodates the same alpha-helices, beta-sheets and protein-binding domains as its HCVpro counterpart, but the model predicts a number of significant differences for DEN2pro and its interactions with substrates and cofactor. Whereas HCVpro contains a Zn2+-binding site, there is no equivalent metal-binding motif in DEN2pro. It is possible that the structural role played by the zinc ion may be provided by a salt bridge between Glu93 and Lys145. The two-component viral protease comprises NS3 and a virus-encoded cofactor, NS4A for HCV and NS2B for DEN2. Previous studies have identified a central 40 amino acid cofactor domain of the dengue virus NS2B that is required for protease activity. Modelling of the putative interactions between DEN2pro and its cofactor suggests that a 12 amino acid hydrophobic region within this sequence (70GSSPILSITISE81) may associate directly with NS3. Modelling also suggests that the substrate binds in an extended conformation to the solvent-exposed surface of the protease, with a P1-binding site that is significantly different from its HCV counterpart. The model described in this study not only reveals unique features of the flavivirus protease but also provides a structural basis for both cofactor and substrate binding that should prove useful in the early design and development of inhibitors.

TI  - Host Cell Targets for Unconventional Antivirals against RNA Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - The recent COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the importance of RNA-based viruses. The most prominent members of this group are SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus), HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), EBOV (Ebola virus), DENV (dengue virus), HCV (hepatitis C virus), ZIKV (Zika virus), CHIKV (chikungunya virus), and influenza A virus. With the exception of retroviruses which produce reverse transcriptase, the majority of RNA viruses encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerases which do not include molecular proofreading tools, underlying the high mutation capacity of these viruses as they multiply in the host cells. Together with their ability to manipulate the immune system of the host in different ways, their high mutation frequency poses a challenge to develop effective and durable vaccination and/or treatments. Consequently, the use of antiviral targeting agents, while an important part of the therapeutic strategy against infection, may lead to the selection of drug-resistant variants. The crucial role of the host cell replicative and processing machinery is essential for the replicative cycle of the viruses and has driven attention to the potential use of drugs directed to the host machinery as therapeutic alternatives to treat viral infections. In this review, we discuss small molecules with antiviral effects that target cellular factors in different steps of the infectious cycle of many RNA viruses. We emphasize the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs with broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Finally, we postulate that the ferruginol analog (18-(phthalimide-2-yl) ferruginol) is a potential host-targeted antiviral.

AB  - Dengue is a pandemic-prone viral disease which is endemic in more than 100 countries and which puts half of the world's population at risk. While the disease presents as subclinical infection or mild fever in the majority of cases, approximately a quarter of the infected individuals experience severe forms of disease like dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome that cause significant rates of mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of this differential outcome of infection is determined by a complex interplay of factors associated with the virus, vector, and host; much of which is not completely understood. In this review, we present an update on the various host genetic polymorphisms that have been reported to influence the susceptibility to dengue. For the convenience of discussion, we have categorized the genetic factors according to the different arms of the immune system with which the corresponding immune determinants are associated.

TI  - Host Immune Response to Dengue Virus Infection: Friend or Foe?
JF  - Immuno
AB  - DENV belongs to the Flaviviridae family and possesses a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. DENV infection manifests in mild subclinical forms or severe forms that may be dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Despite a lot of effort worldwide, the exact mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of severe DENV infection remains elusive. It is believed that both host and viral factors contribute to the outcome of dengue disease. The host factors are age at the time of infection, sex, nutrition, and immune status, including the presence of pre-existing antibodies or reactive T cells. Viral factors include the serotype, genotype, and mutation(s) due to error-prone RNA-dependent polymerase leading to the development of quasispecies. Accumulating bodies of literature have depicted that DENV has many ways to invade and escape the immune system of the host. These invading strategies are directed to overcome innate and adaptive immune responses. Like other viruses, once the infection is established, the host also mounts a series of antiviral responses to combat and eliminate the virus replication. Nevertheless, DENV has evolved a variety of mechanisms to evade the immune system. In this review, we have emphasized the strategies that DENV employs to hijack the host innate (interferon, IFN; toll-like receptors, TLR; major histocompatibility complex, MHC; autophagy; complement; apoptosis; RNAi) and adaptive (antibody-dependent enhancement, ADE; T cell immunity) immune responses, which contribute to the severity of DENV disease.

AB  - Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) proteomic analyses have revealed that host proteins are often captured in extracellular virions. These proteins may play a role in viral replication or infectivity and can represent targets for broad-spectrum antiviral agent development. We utilized LCMS to determine the host protein composition of Lassa virus-like particles (LASV VLPs). Multiple host proteins incorporated in LASV VLPs are also incorporated in unrelated viruses, notably ribosomal proteins. We assembled a data set of host proteins incorporated into extracellular viral particles. The frequent incorporation of specific host proteins into viruses of diverse families suggests that interactions of these proteins with viral factors may be important for effective viral replication. Drugs that target virion-associated host proteins could affect the protein in the extracellular virion or the host cell. Compounds that target proteins incorporated into virions with high frequency, but with no known antiviral activity, were assayed in a scalable viral screening platform, and hits were tested in competent viral systems. One of these molecules, GAPDH modulating small molecule CGP 3466B maleate (Omigapil), exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of HIV, dengue virus, and Zika virus.

JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology
VL  - 32
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito‐borne flavivirus that causes frequent outbreaks in tropical countries. Due to the four different serotypes and ever‐mutating RNA genome, it is challenging to develop efficient therapeutics. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent the severe form of dengue, leading to mortality. In the past decade, rapid advancement in the high throughput sequencing technologies has shed light on the crucial regulating role of non‐coding RNAs (ncRNAs), also known as the “dark matter” of the genome, in various pathological processes. In addition to the human host ncRNAs like microRNAs and circular RNAs, DENV also produces ncRNAs such as subgenomic flaviviral RNAs that can modulate the virus life cycle and regulate disease outcomes. This review outlines the advances in understanding the interplay between the human host and DENV ncRNAs, their regulation of the innate immune system of the host, and the prospects of the ncRNAs in clinical applications such as dengue diagnosis and promising therapeutics.

TI  - Host heme oxygenase‐1: Friend or foe in tackling pathogens?
JF  - IUBMB Life
VL  - 70
AB  - Infectious diseases are a major challenge in management of human health worldwide. Recent literature suggests that host immune system could be modulated to ameliorate the pathogenesis of infectious disease. Heme oxygenase (HMOX1) is a key regulator of cellular signaling and it could be modulated using pharmacological reagents. HMOX1 is a cytoprotective enzyme that degrades heme to generate carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin, and molecular iron. CO and biliverdin (or bilirubin derived from it) can restrict the growth of a few pathogens. Both of these also induce antioxidant pathways and anti‐inflammatory pathways. On the other hand, molecular iron can induce proinflammatory pathway besides making the cellular environment oxidative in nature. Since microbial infections often induce oxidative stress in host cells/tissues, role of HMOX1 has been analyzed in the pathogenesis of number of infections. In this review, we have described the role of HMOX1 in pathogenesis of bacterial infections caused by Mycobacterium species, Salmonella and in microbial sepsis. We have also provided a succinct overview of the role of HMOX1 in parasitic infections such as malaria and leishmaniasis. In the end, we have also elaborated the role of HMOX1 in viral infections such as AIDS, hepatitis, dengue, and influenza. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(9):869–880, 2018

TI  - Host immune response against DENV and ZIKV infections
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue is a major public health concern, affecting almost 400 million people worldwide, with about 70% of the global burden of disease in Asia. Despite revised clinical classifications of dengue infections by the World Health Organization, the wide spectrum of the manifestations of dengue illness continues to pose challenges in diagnosis and patient management for clinicians. When the Zika epidemic spread through the American continent and then later to Africa and Asia in 2015, researchers compared the characteristics of the Zika infection to Dengue, considering both these viruses were transmitted primarily through the same vector, the Aedes aegypti female mosquitoes. An important difference to note, however, was that the Zika epidemic diffused in a shorter time span compared to the persisting feature of Dengue infections, which is endemic in many Asian countries. As the pathogenesis of viral illnesses is affected by host immune responses, various immune modulators have been proposed as biomarkers to predict the risk of the disease progression to a severe form, at a much earlier stage of the illness. However, the findings for most biomarkers are highly discrepant between studies. Meanwhile, the cross-reactivity of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells response to Dengue and Zika viruses provide important clues for further development of potential treatments. This review discusses similarities between Dengue and Zika infections, comparing their disease transmissions and vectors involved, and both the innate and adaptive immune responses in these infections. Consideration of the genetic identity of both the Dengue and Zika flaviviruses as well as the cross-reactivity of relevant T cells along with the actions of CD4+ cytotoxic cells in these infections are also presented. Finally, a summary of the immune biomarkers that have been reported for dengue and Zika viral infections are discussed which may be useful indicators for future anti-viral targets or predictors for disease severity. Together, this information appraises the current understanding of both Zika and Dengue infections, providing insights for future vaccine design approaches against both viruses.

TI  - Host reverse transcriptase is required to maintain persistent dengue virus infections in C6/36 insect cells
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - It has been long known that C6/36 cells challenged with Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) show initial cytopathic effects (CPE) but overcome these within 3 split passages to resume normal growth and morphology. It is also known that establishment of persistent infections requires combined action of host reverse-transcriptase (RT) activity and RNA-mediated interference (RNAi). We hypothesized that RT inhibition in C6/36 cells would also prevent persistent infections with DENV-2 and that treatment of stable, grossly normal C6/36 cells persistently infected with DENV-2, even after long passaging, would revert to CPE and die under continuous exposure to the RT inhibitor tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Toxicity tests using TDF with naive C6/36 cells revealed limited effects at 0.1 mM but challenge with DENV-2 in its presence resulted in death, as expected based on previous reports. However, TDF treatment of stable, grossly normal C6/36 cell cultures persistently infected with DENV-2 for up to 30 split passages also induced severe CPE and death. The results indicate a key role of host RT not only in the establishment of persistent infections but also in their long-term maintenance. Persistent infections in shrimp and insects are sometimes characterized with low to very low levels of viral infection that are not detectable by routine histological analysis, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry or even by very sensitive PCR. Our results suggest that treatment of grossly normal insects or crustaceans with TDF may be a simple approach to induce higher replication by accommodated viruses. This could improve detection by histological or molecular methods and provide a way to invoke a disease state. It could also be used to increase viral quantities for purification purposes.

TI  - Host serine protease ACOT2 assists DENV proliferation by hydrolyzing viral polyproteins
JF  - mSystems
VL  - 9
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV). The replication of DENV relies on the processing of its genome-encoded polyprotein by both viral protease NS3 (NS3pro) and host proteases. However, the impact of host proteases on DENV proliferation is not well understood. In this study, we utilized fluorophosphonate-based probes (FPs) to investigate the up-regulation of host serine proteases during DENV infection in detail. Among the identified proteases, acyl-CoA thioesterase 2 (ACOT2), an enzyme that hydrolyzes acyl-CoA molecules to generate fatty acids and free CoA, exhibited cleavage activity against DENV polypeptide substrates. Enzymatic assays and virological experiments confirmed that ACOT2 contributes to DENV propagation during the replication stage by cleaving the viral polyprotein. Docking models provided insights into the binding pocket of viral polypeptides and the catalytic mechanism of ACOT2. Notably, this study is the first to demonstrate that ACOT2 functions as a serine protease to hydrolyze protein substrates. These findings offer novel insights into DENV infection, host response, as well as the potential development of innovative antiviral strategies. IMPORTANCE DENV, one of the major pathogens of Dengue fever, remains a significant public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. How DENV efficiently hijacks the host and accesses its life cycle with delicate interaction remains to be elucidated. Here, we deconvoluted that the host protease ACOT2 assists the DENV replication and characterized the ACOT2 as a serine protease involved in the hydrolysis of the DENV polypeptide substrate. Our results not only further the understanding of the DENV life cycle but also provide a possibility for the usage of activity-based proteomics to reveal host-virus interactions.

TI  - How Dengue Virus Circumvents Innate Immunity
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 9
AB  - In the battle between a virus and its host, innate immunity serves as the first line of defense protecting the host against pathogens. The antiviral actions start with the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns derived from the virus, then ultimately turning on particular transcription factors to generate antiviral interferons (IFNs) or proinflammatory cytokines via fine-tuned signaling cascades. With dengue virus (DENV) infection, its viral RNA is recognized by the host RNA sensors, mainly retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and toll-like receptors. DENV infection also activates the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS–STING)-mediated DNA-sensing pathway despite the absence of a DNA stage in the DENV lifecycle. In the last decade, DENV has been considered a weak IFN-inducing pathogen with the evidence that DENV has evolved multiple strategies antagonizing the host IFN system. DENV passively escapes from innate immunity surveillance and also actively subverts the innate immune system at multiple steps. DENV targets both RNA-triggered RLR–mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (RLR–MAVS) and DNA-triggered cGAS–STING signaling to reduce IFN production in infected cells. It also blocks IFN action by inhibiting IFN regulatory factor- and signal transducer and activator of transcription-mediated signaling. This review explores the current understanding of how DENV escapes the control of the innate immune system by modifying viral RNA and viral protein and by post-translational modification of cellular factors. The roles of the DNA-sensing pathway in DENV infection, and how mitochondrial dynamics participates in innate immunity are also discussed.

TI  - How Flaviviruses Activate and Suppress the Interferon Response
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 2
SP  - 676
EP  - 691
AB  - The flavivirus genus includes viruses with a remarkable ability to produce disease on a large scale. The expansion and increased endemicity of dengue and West Nile viruses in the Americas exemplifies their medical and epidemiological importance. The rapid detection of viral infection and induction of the innate antiviral response are crucial to determining the outcome of infection. The intracellular pathogen receptors RIG-I and MDA5 play a central role in detecting flavivirus infections and initiating a robust antiviral response. Yet, these viruses are still capable of producing acute illness in humans. It is now clear that flaviviruses utilize a variety of mechanisms to modulate the interferon response. The non-structural proteins of the various flaviviruses reduce expression of interferon dependent genes by blocking phosphorylation, enhancing degradation or down-regulating expression of major components of the JAK/STAT pathway. Recent studies indicate that interferon modulation is an important factor in the development of severe flaviviral illness. This suggests that an increased understanding of viral-host interactions will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics to treat these viral infections and improved biological models to study flavivirus pathogenesis.

TI  - How Positive-Strand RNA Viruses Benefit from Autophagosome Maturation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 9966
EP  - 9972
AB  - ABSTRACT The autophagic degradation pathway is a powerful tool in the host cell arsenal against cytosolic pathogens. Contents trapped inside cytosolic vesicles, termed autophagosomes, are delivered to the lysosome for degradation. In spite of the degradative nature of the pathway, some pathogens are able to subvert autophagy for their benefit. In many cases, these pathogens have developed strategies to induce the autophagic signaling pathway while inhibiting the associated degradation activity. One surprising finding from recent literature is that some viruses do not impede degradation but instead promote the generation of degradative autolysosomes, which are the endpoint compartments of autophagy. Dengue virus, poliovirus, and hepatitis C virus, all positive-strand RNA viruses, utilize the maturation of autophagosomes into acidic and ultimately degradative compartments to promote their replication. While the benefits that each virus reaps from autophagosome maturation are unique, the parallels between the viruses indicate a complex relationship between cytosolic viruses and host cell degradation vesicles.

TI  - Human Apolipoprotein A-I Is Associated with Dengue Virus and Enhances Virus Infection through SR-BI
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 8
AB  - Diseases caused by dengue virus (DV) infection vary in severity, with symptoms ranging from mild fever to life threatening dengue hemorrhage fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Clinical studies have shown that significant decrease in the level of lipoproteins is correlated with severe illness in DHF/DSS patients. Available evidence also indicates that lipoproteins including high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are able to facilitate cell entry of HCV or other flaviviruses via corresponding lipoprotein receptors. In this study, we found that pre-incubation of DV with human serum leads to an enhanced DV infectivity in various types of cells. Such enhancement could be due to interactions between serum components and DV particles. Through co-immunoprecipitation we revealed that apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), the major protein component in HDL, is associated with DV particles and is able to promote DV infection. Based on that observation, we further found that siRNA knockdown of the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), the cell receptor of ApoA-I, abolished the activity of ApoA-I in enhancement of DV infection. This suggests that ApoA-I bridges DV particles and cell receptor SR-BI and facilitates entry of DV into cells. FACS analysis of cell surface dengue antigen after virus absorption further confirmed that ApoA-I enhances DV infection via promoting initial attachment of the virus to cells. These findings illustrate a novel entry route of DV into cells, which may provide insights into the functional importance of lipoproteins in dengue pathogenesis.

TI  - Human C5a Protein Participates in the Mosquito Immune Response Against Dengue Virus
JF  - Journal of Medical Entomology
VL  - 53
SP  - 505
EP  - 512
AB  - Abstract Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted by Aedes spp mosquitoes during a bloodmeal uptake. The bloodmeal consists of host cells, immune factors, and possibly blood-borne pathogens, such as arboviruses. Human cells and immune-related factors, like the complement system, can remain active in the bloodmeal and may be able to interact with pathogens in the mosquito. Previous studies have shown that active complement proteins impact Plasmodium parasite viability in the Anopheles midgut. Thus, we investigated the effects of the human complement on DENV infection in the midgut of Aedes aegypti. Our findings indicate that mosquitoes receiving DENV mixed with normal non-inactivated human serum showed significantly lower viremia than those fed with heat-inactivated serum. This implies that human complement may act to limit DENV infection in the mosquito midgut. In addition, we found that human complement C5a protein was able to directly communicate with mosquito cells, affecting the cell antiviral response against DENV. Our results also show that human C5a protein is able to interact with several membrane-bound mosquito proteins. Together these results suggest an important role of human complement protein in DENV transmission.

TI  - Human CD8+ T-Cell Responses Against the 4 Dengue Virus Serotypes Are Associated With Distinct Patterns of Protein Targets.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 212 11
SP  - 1743
EP  - 51
AB  - BACKGROUND
All 4 dengue virus (DENV) serotypes are now simultaneously circulating worldwide and responsible for up to 400 million human infections each year. Previous studies of CD8(+) T-cell responses in HLA-transgenic mice and human vaccinees demonstrated that the hierarchy of immunodominance among structural versus nonstructural proteins differs as a function of the infecting serotype. This led to the hypothesis that there are intrinsic differences in the serotype-specific reactivity of CD8(+) T-cell responses.


METHODS
We tested this hypothesis by analyzing serotype-specific CD8(+) T-cell reactivity in naturally infected human donors from Sri Lanka and Nicaragua, using ex vivo interferon γ-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays.


RESULTS
Remarkably similar and clear serotype-specific patterns of immunodominance in both cohorts were identified. Pooling of epitopes that accounted for 90% of the interferon γ response in both cohorts resulted in a global epitope pool. Its reactivity was confirmed in naturally infected donors from Brazil, demonstrating its global applicability.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides new insight into differential serotype-specific immunogenicity of DENV proteins. It further provides a potentially valuable tool for future investigations of CD8(+) T-cell responses in the typically small sample volumes available from patients with acute fever and children without requiring prior knowledge of either infecting DENV serotype or HLA type.

TI  - Human DDX3 protein is a valuable target to develop broad spectrum antiviral agents
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 113
SP  - 5388
EP  - 5393
AB  - Significance Human DEAD-box polypeptide 3 (DDX3) is an ATPase/RNA helicase involved in the replication of many viral pathogens. We reported herein the first inhibitor, to our knowledge, of the helicase binding site of DDX3 endowed with a broad spectrum antiviral activity [HIV-1 WT, HIV drug-resistant strains, Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV)]. The good toxicity profile suggests that the DDX3 activity, although essential for viruses, could be dispensable to the cells, validating DDX3 as a pharmaceutical target. Our results clearly showed that DDX3 inhibitors could be exploited to treat HIV/HCV coinfections, emerging infectious diseases (such as DENV and WNV), and HIV-1 patients carrying drug-resistant strains. Each of these three medical conditions currently represents a major challenge for clinical treatment. Targeting a host factor essential for the replication of different viruses but not for the cells offers a higher genetic barrier to the development of resistance, may simplify therapy regimens for coinfections, and facilitates management of emerging viral diseases. DEAD-box polypeptide 3 (DDX3) is a human host factor required for the replication of several DNA and RNA viruses, including some of the most challenging human pathogens currently circulating, such as HIV-1, Hepatitis C virus, Dengue virus, and West Nile virus. Herein, we showed for the first time, to our knowledge, that the inhibition of DDX3 by a small molecule could be successfully exploited for the development of a broad spectrum antiviral agent. In addition to the multiple antiviral activities, hit compound 16d retained full activity against drug-resistant HIV-1 strains in the absence of cellular toxicity. Pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies in rats confirmed a good safety profile and bioavailability of 16d. Thus, DDX3 is here validated as a valuable therapeutic target.

AB  - This chapter reviews genetic traits associated with susceptibility and resistance to several RNA viruses. HIV is an enveloped retrovirus that has caused more than 25 million deaths worldwide. CCL3L1 is a duplicated variant of CCL3 (MIP-1-α), and this chemokine is the most potent chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) agonist and hence the most effective competitive inhibitor of R5 HIV-1 entry. Volunteer challenge studies have concluded that (i) nonsecretors are resistant to infection, (ii) susceptibility occurs despite repeated challenge with identical virus, and (iii) short-term protective immunity can develop. Studies from authentic outbreaks show that protection from symptomatic norovirus infection is strongly associated with the G428A nonsense mutation in FUT2. There are four different dengue virus serotypes circulating (1 to 4), each being able to cause both asymptomatic and severe disease. A study that compared the genotypes of 87 unrelated Thai children who had been hospitalized because of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) was followed and reviewed by others, of which several found associations with HLA class I genotypes and some also with an HLA class II antigen. There is limited information regarding human genetic susceptibility factors associated with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). An interesting example comes from the pharmacokinetics of an HIV medicine, in which abacavir, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, can induce hypersensitivity that limits its use. Investigators identified a particular HLA haplotype that greatly increases the risk of abacavir hypersensitivity.

TI  - Human Sec3 protein is a novel transcriptional and translational repressor of flavivirus
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - The Flaviviridae family consists of several medically important pathogens such as West Nile virus (WNV) and Dengue virus (DENV). Flavivirus capsid (C) protein is a key structural component of virus particles. However, the role of C protein in the pathogenesis of arthropod‐borne flaviviruses is poorly understood. To examine whether flavivirus C protein can associate with cellular proteins, and contribute to viral pathogenesis, WNV/DENV C protein was screened against a human brain/liver cDNA yeast two‐hybrid library. This study identified human Sec3 exocyst protein (hSec3p) as a novel interacting partner of WNV and DENV C protein. Mutagenesis studies showed that the SH2 domain‐binding motif of hSec3p binds to the first 15 amino acids of C protein. We report for the first time that hSec3p can modulate virus production by affecting viral RNA transcription and translation through the sequestration of elongation factor 1α (EF1α). This molecular discovery shed light on the protective role of hSec3p during flavivirus infection. This study also highlighted the antagonistic mechanism adopted by flavivirus C protein that can negatively regulate the formation of hSec3p–EF1α complex by sequestering hSec3p to establish successful infection.

TI  - Human T Cell Response to Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 10
AB  - DENV is a major public health problem worldwide, thus underlining the overall significance of the proposed Program. The four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (1–4) cause the most common mosquito-borne viral disease of humans, with 3 billion people at risk for infection and up to 100 million cases each year, most often affecting children. The protective role of T cells during viral infection is well-established. Generally, CD8 T cells can control viral infection through several mechanisms, including direct cytotoxicity, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α. Similarly, CD4 T cells are thought to control viral infection through multiple mechanisms, including enhancement of B and CD8 T cell responses, production of inflammatory and anti-viral cytokines, cytotoxicity, and promotion of memory responses. To probe the phenotype of virus-specific T cells, epitopes derived from viral sequences need to be known. Here we discuss the identification of CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes derived from DENV and how these epitopes have been used by researchers to interrogate the phenotype and function of DENV-specific T cell populations.

JF  -

AB  - There are four serotypes of dengue virus designated dengue 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 (D 1 , D2 D3 and D4) and epidemiological studies indicate that a severe complication of dengue virus infection dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is more likely to occur following a secondar infection. DHF is hypothesized to be immunologically mediated and may be triggered by virus-specific T cells. It is also likely that dengue virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are important for recovery from dengue virus infections. An analysis of the immune response during acute illness and when the patient has recovered from the infection (immune state) is therefore important as it will provide insights into the immunopathological nature of the disease. This thesis initially examines the CD8+ CTL responses in volunteers who have received live attenuated dengue vaccines and then investigates acute and immune T cell responses in children following natural infection '" .-.. ... --... .

TI  - Human T Lymphocytes Are Permissive for Dengue Virus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 92
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DV) infection can cause either a self-limiting flu-like disease or a threatening hemorrhage that may evolve to shock and death. A variety of cell types, such as dendritic cells, monocytes, and B cells, can be infected by DV. However, despite the role of T lymphocytes in the control of DV replication, there remains a paucity of information on possible DV-T cell interactions during the disease course. In the present study, we have demonstrated that primary human naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are permissive for DV infection. Importantly, both T cell subtypes support viral replication and secrete viable virus particles. DV infection triggers the activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, but preactivation of T cells reduces the susceptibility of T cells to DV infection. Interestingly, the cytotoxicity-inducing protein granzyme A is highly secreted by human CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells after exposure to DV in vitro. Additionally, using annexin V and polycaspase assays, we have demonstrated that T lymphocytes, in contrast to monocytes, are resistant to DV-induced apoptosis. Strikingly, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were found to be infected with DV in acutely infected dengue patients. Together, these results show that T cells are permissive for DV infection in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this cell population may be a viral reservoir during the acute phase of the disease. IMPORTANCE Infection by dengue virus (DV) causes a flu-like disease that can evolve to severe hemorrhaging and death. T lymphocytes are important cells that regulate antibody secretion by B cells and trigger the death of infected cells. However, little is known about the direct interaction between DV and T lymphocytes. Here, we show that T lymphocytes from healthy donors are susceptible to infection by DV, leading to cell activation. Additionally, T cells seem to be resistant to DV-induced apoptosis, suggesting a potential role as a viral reservoir in humans. Finally, we show that both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes from acutely infected DV patients are infected by DV. Our results raise new questions about DV pathogenesis and vaccine development.

TI  - Human TLR3 recognizes dengue virus and modulates viral replication in vitro
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - The elicitation of large amount inflammatory cytokine in serum has been developed as the cause of the plasma leakage in dengue fever (DF)/dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) infection. Virus recognition in innate immunity is the key. The Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in pathogen recognition towards cytokine induction among several viruses; however, the role of TLRs on innate immune recognition against DENV remains unclear. This study aims at the interaction between dengue virus (DENV) and human TLRs at the incipient stage of infection in vitro. Our experiment reveals that stably expression of TLR3, 7, 8 on HEK293 enables IL‐8 secretion after DENV recognition. By the model of human monocytic cells U937, we demonstrated the trigger of IL‐8 after viral recognition of human monocytic cell is primary through TLR3 following endosomal acidification. Silencing of TLR3 in U937 cells significantly blocks the DENV‐induced IL‐8 production. Besides, the interaction is further corroborated by colocalization of TLR3 and DENV RNA upon DENV internalization. Furthermore, in this study we found the expression of TLR3 can mediate strong IFN‐α/β release and inhibit DENV viral replication significantly, thus limit the cytopathic effect.

AB  - Dengue virus infections are an emerging global threat. Severe dengue infection is manifested as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, both of which can be fatal complications. Factors predisposing to complicated disease and pathogenesis of severe infections are discussed. Using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and ELISA techniques, we studied the cellular targets of dengue virus infection, at both the clinical (in vivo) and the laboratory (in vitro) level. Resident skin dendritic cells are targets of dengue virus infection as demonstrated in a skin biopsy from a dengue vaccine recipient. We show that factors influencing infection of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells are different. Immature dendritic cells were found to be the cells most permissive for dengue infection and maybe early targets for infection. Immature dendritic cells exposed to dengue virus produce TNF-alpha protein. Some of these immature dendritic cells undergo TNF-alpha mediated maturation as a consequence of exposure to the dengue virus.

AB  - Virus-host interactions play important roles in virus infection and host cellular response. Several viruses, including dengue virus (DENV), usurp host chaperones to support their amplification and survival in the host cell. We investigated the interaction of nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of DENV with three endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperones (i.e. GRP78, calnexin and calreticulin) to delineate their functional roles and potential binding sites for protein complex formation. GRP78 protein showed prominent association with DENV NS1 in virus-infected Huh7 cells as evidenced by co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Further studies on the functional interaction of GRP78 protein were performed by using siRNA-mediated gene knockdown in a DENV replicon transfection system. GRP78 knockdown significantly decreased intracellular NS1 production and delayed NS1 secretion but had no effect on viral RNA replication. Dissecting the important domain of GRP78 required for DENV NS1 interaction showed co-immunoprecipitation of DENV NS1 with a full-length and substrate-binding domain (SBD), but not an ATPase domain, of GRP78, confirming their interaction through SBD binding. Molecular dynamics simulations of DENV NS1 and human GRP78 complex revealed their potential binding sites through hydrogen and hydrophobic bonding. The majority of GRP78-binding sites were located in a β-roll domain and connector subdomains on the DENV NS1 structure involved in hydrophobic surface formation. Taken together, our findings demonstrated the roles of human GRP78 in facilitating the intracellular production and secretion of DENV NS1 as well as predicted potential binding sites between the DENV NS1 and GRP78 complex, which could have implications in the future development of target-based antiviral drugs.

TI  - Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived glial cells and neural progenitors display divergent responses to Zika and dengue infections
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 115
SP  - 7117
EP  - 7122
AB  - Significance We describe the ability of the Zika virus to infect various cells of the fetal brain, modeled from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient and grown in identical conditions. Zika is associated with microcephaly, while the similar dengue virus is not. We described differences in the behavior of these two viruses. Zika often fails to trigger efficient antiviral responses, surviving encounters with brain immune cells, and killing immature nerve cell precursors that have poor innate antiviral defenses. Precursors of the brain’s immune cells, microglia, circulating in the fetus, may take the virus to the fetal brain where it will stall growth or cause cell death. We show that interferon-γ efficiently protects against this viral transfer. Maternal Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is recognized as the cause of an epidemic of microcephaly and other neurological anomalies in human fetuses. It remains unclear how ZIKV accesses the highly vulnerable population of neural progenitors of the fetal central nervous system (CNS), and which cell types of the CNS may be viral reservoirs. In contrast, the related dengue virus (DENV) does not elicit teratogenicity. To model viral interaction with cells of the fetal CNS in vitro, we investigated the tropism of ZIKV and DENV for different induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human cells, with a particular focus on microglia-like cells. We show that ZIKV infected isogenic neural progenitors, astrocytes, and microglia-like cells (pMGLs), but was only cytotoxic to neural progenitors. Infected glial cells propagated ZIKV and maintained ZIKV load over time, leading to viral spread to susceptible cells. DENV triggered stronger immune responses and could be cleared by neural and glial cells more efficiently. pMGLs, when cocultured with neural spheroids, invaded the tissue and, when infected with ZIKV, initiated neural infection. Since microglia derive from primitive macrophages originating in proximity to the maternal vasculature, they may act as a viral reservoir for ZIKV and establish infection of the fetal brain. Infection of immature neural stem cells by invading microglia may occur in the early stages of pregnancy, before angiogenesis in the brain rudiments. Our data are also consistent with ZIKV and DENV affecting the integrity of the blood–brain barrier, thus allowing infection of the brain later in life.

TI  - Human macrophages differentiated in the presence of vitamin D3 restrict dengue virus infection and innate responses by downregulating mannose receptor expression
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 11
AB  - Background Severe dengue disease is associated with high viral loads and overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting impairment in the control of dengue virus (DENV) and the mechanisms that regulate cytokine production. Vitamin D3 has been described as an important modulator of immune responses to several pathogens. Interestingly, increasing evidence has associated vitamin D with decreased DENV infection and early disease recovery, yet the molecular mechanisms whereby vitamin D reduces DENV infection are not well understood. Methods and principal findings Macrophages represent important cell targets for DENV replication and consequently, they are key drivers of dengue disease. In this study we evaluated the effect of vitamin D3 on the differentiation of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and their susceptibility and cytokine response to DENV. Our data demonstrate that MDM differentiated in the presence of vitamin D3 (D3-MDM) restrict DENV infection and moderate the classical inflammatory cytokine response. Mechanistically, vitamin D3-driven differentiation led to reduced surface expression of C-type lectins including the mannose receptor (MR, CD206) that is known to act as primary receptor for DENV attachment on macrophages and to trigger of immune signaling. Consequently, DENV bound less efficiently to vitamin D3-differentiated macrophages, leading to lower infection. Interestingly, IL-4 enhanced infection was reduced in D3-MDM by restriction of MR expression. Moreover, we detected moderate secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10 in D3-MDM, likely due to less MR engagement during DENV infection. Conclusions/Significance Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which vitamin D counteracts DENV infection and progression of severe disease, and indicates its potential relevance as a preventive or therapeutic candidate.

TI  - Human megakaryocytes possess intrinsic antiviral immunity through regulated induction of IFITM3.
JF  - Blood
VL  - 133 19
SP  - 2013
EP  - 2026
AB  - Evolving evidence indicates that platelets and megakaryocytes (MKs) have unexpected activities in inflammation and infection; whether viral infections upregulate biologically active, antiviral immune genes in platelets and MKs is unknown, however. We examined antiviral immune genes in these cells in dengue and influenza infections, viruses that are global public health threats. Using complementary biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic approaches, we examined the regulation and function of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), an antiviral immune effector gene not previously studied in human platelets and MKs. IFITM3 was markedly upregulated in platelets isolated from patients during clinical influenza and dengue virus (DENV) infections. Lower IFITM3 expression in platelets correlated with increased illness severity and mortality in patients. Administering a live, attenuated DENV vaccine to healthy subjects significantly increased platelet IFITM3 expression. Infecting human MKs with DENV selectively increased type I interferons and IFITM3. Overexpression of IFITM3 in MKs was sufficient to prevent DENV infection. In naturally occurring, genetic loss-of-function studies, MKs from healthy subjects harboring a homozygous mutation in IFITM3 (rs12252-C, a common single-nucleotide polymorphism in areas of the world where DENV is endemic) were significantly more susceptible to DENV infection. DENV-induced MK secretion of interferons prevented infection of bystander MKs and hematopoietic stem cells. Thus, viral infections upregulate IFITM3 in human platelets and MKs, and IFITM3 expression is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. These observations establish, for the first time, that human MKs possess antiviral functions, preventing DENV infection of MKs and hematopoietic stem cells after local immune signaling.

JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 5
AB  - The successful transmission of dengue virus from a human host to a mosquito vector requires a complex set of factors to align. It is becoming increasingly important to improve our understanding of the parameters that shape the human to mosquito component of the transmission cycle so that vaccines and therapeutic antivirals can be fully evaluated and epidemiological models refined. Here we describe these factors, and discuss the biological and environmental impacts and demographic changes that are influencing these dynamics. Specifically, we examine features of the human infection required for the mosquito to acquire the virus via natural blood feeding, as well as the biological and environmental factors that influence a mosquito’s susceptibility to infection, up to the point that they are capable of transmitting the virus to a new host.

JF  - Molecular Membrane Biology
VL  - 30
SP  - 273
EP  - 287
AB  - Abstract Dengue virus (DENV) C protein is essential for viral assembly. DENV C protein associates with intracellular membranes through a conserved hydrophobic domain and accumulates around endoplasmic reticulum-derived lipid droplets which could provide a platform for capsid formation during assembly. In a previous work we described a region in DENV C protein which induced a nearly complete membrane rupture of several membrane model systems, which was coincident with the theoretically predicted highly hydrophobic region of the protein. In this work we have carried out a study of the binding to and interaction with model biomembranes of a peptide corresponding to this DENV C region, DENV2C6. We show that DENV2C6 partitions into phospholipid membranes, is capable of rupturing membranes even at very low peptide-to-lipid ratios and its membrane-activity is modulated by lipid composition. These results identify an important region in the DENV C protein which might be directly implicated in the DENV life cycle through the modulation of membrane structure.

TI  - Hyperglycemia exacerbates dengue virus infection by facilitating poly(A)-binding protein–mediated viral translation
JF  - JCI Insight
VL  - 7
AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is highly comorbid with severe dengue diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Patients with DM have a 1.61-fold increased risk of developing dengue hemorrhagic fever. In search of host factors involved in dengue virus (DENV) infection, we used high-glucose (HG) treatment and showed that HG increased viral protein expression and virion release but had no effects on the early stages of viral infection. After HG stimulation, DENV–firefly luciferase–transfected assay and cellular replicon–based assay indicated increased viral translation, whereas using the glucose uptake inhibitor phloretin blocked this effect. HG treatment increased the translational factor poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) in a glucose transporter–associated, PI3K/AKT-regulated manner. Silencing PABP significantly decreased HG-prompted virion production. HG enhanced the formation of the PABP–eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G complex, which is regulated by protein–disulfide isomerase. Hyperglycemia increased PABP expression, mortality rate, viral protein expression, and viral loads in streptozotocin-induced DM mice. Overall, hyperglycemic stress facilitates DENV infection by strengthening PABP-mediated viral translation.

TI  - Hypoalbuminemia as a predictor of severe dengue: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
JF  - Expert review of anti-infective therapy
AB  - INTRODUCTION
Dengue fever is a significant health concern globally, especially in tropical regions. Identifying reliable markers for severe dengue, such as hypoalbuminemia, is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment.


METHODS
This review systematically explores the association between hypoalbuminemia and severe dengue. We searched databases including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science until 28 December 2023, focusing on studies that reported albumin levels in dengue patients. Our selection criteria aimed at observational studies, from which data extraction and quality assessment were performed using Nested- Knowledge and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.


RESULTS
A meta-analysis of 17 studies involving 974 severe and 18,496 non-severe dengue patients identified a standardized mean difference (SMD) in albumin levels of -1.625 g/dL (95% CI: -3.618 to -0.369). Subgroup analysis indicated more pronounced hypoalbuminemia in pediatric patients, with a pooled SMD of -1.08 g/dL (95% CI: -1.71 to -0.45). Our analysis demonstrated the link between hypoalbuminemia and severe dengue, indicating a significant pooled relative risk of 2.286, within 95% CI 1.308 to 3.996.


CONCLUSIONS
The study confirms hypoalbuminemia as a significant predictor of severe dengue. Recognizing hypoalbuminemia in dengue patients can aid clinicians in forecasting the severity, potentially improving patient outcomes through targeted therapeutic strategies.

AB  - V iruses are a recurring threat to human health worldwide. From highly prevalent diseases such as HIV, dengue, and influenza to emerging viruses such as Ebola, SARS, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, viral infections cause serious diseases that require active treatment to prevent morbidity and mortality. Effective antiviral drugs are available for only nine viruses, including HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, herpesvirus, influenza virus, human cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and external anogenital warts caused by human papillomavirus; however, most viral diseases lack effective drug treatments (De Clercq and Li, 2016). The lack of narrow and broad spectrum antivirals is a deficiency in the modern medical formulary. This deficiency is due in large part to the genetic and replication-cycle diversity of viruses and the one-virus, one-drug mindset model used for current antiviral therapies. Most currently marketed antivirals have been developed to interact specifically with a viral protein from a virus of interest (e.g., HIV integrase or protease) and have not been shown to have significant utility against other viruses. One approach to identifying broad-spectrum antivirals is to investigate host proteins or cofactors shown to be associated with viral replication that can be targeted by small molecules in a way that blocks viral infection. Uncovering host proteins or metabolic pathways that are important for multiple viruses can open the door for developing broad spectrum inhibitors of viral infection. It is widely recognized that viruses depend on host cellular proteins and machinery at multiple points in their replication cycles, making host factors that are broadly used by many viruses attractive antiviral targets. All viruses use the protein synthesis machinery to drive translation of their mRNA. Identifying components of the translation machinery that are used by multiple viral families offers a significant opportunity to develop a broad spectrum antiviral approach. Inhibiting eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) function has recently emerged as a potential target for this type of intervention. eIF5A is a translation factor that undergoes a unique posttranslational modification, called hypusination. Hypusination of eIF5A occurs at Lysine 50 through a two-enzyme cascade, where an aminobutyl moiety from the polyamine spermidine becomes incorporated (by deoxyhypusine synthase [DHPS]) and hydroxylated (by deoxyhypusine hydroxylase [DOHH]), forming the hypusine residue (Fig. 1).

TI  - IFI6 Inhibits Apoptosis via Mitochondrial-Dependent Pathway in Dengue Virus 2 Infected Vascular Endothelial Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is a fatal infectious disease that demands an effective treatment. Interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) induced by dengue virus (DENV) exert antiviral effects. Among ISGs, IFN-α inducible gene 6 (IFI6) was increased in DENV infected human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) by microarray analysis in our previous study. However, its function is incompletely understood. In this study, we confirmed that IFI6 was markedly induced in DENV infection of both primary HUVECs and EA.hy926 cell lines. Recombinant EA.hy926 cell lines in which IFI6 was either over-expressed (IFI6+/+) or knocked-down (IFI6-/-) were generated. The activation of caspase-3 and intrinsic apoptosis-related protein caspase-9 were down-regulated in IFI6+/+ but up-regulated in IFI6-/- cells at 24–48 hrs post-infection. After incubation with DENV for 48 hrs, the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ(m)) was more stable in IFI6+/+ cells but reduced in IFI6-/- cells, as assayed by fluorescence staining with JC-1. We observed that Bcl-2 expression was increased in IFI6+/+ and decreased in IFI6-/- cells. By contrast, Bax expression was decreased in IFI6+/+ and increased in IFI6-/- cells. It is presumed that the anti-apoptotic function of IFI6 is expressed by regulating the rheostatic balance between bcl-2/bax expression and inhibition of Δψ(m) depolarization during DENV infection of vascular endothelial cells(VECs). In addition, the pro-apoptotic protein X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis (XIAP)-Associated Factor 1(XAF1) expression had been reported to be up-regulated and led to the induction of apoptosis in DENV2-infected VECs,but the relationship between XAF1 and IFI6 dengue virus-induced apoptosis in VECs warrants further study.

TI  - IFITM-Family Proteins: The Cell's First Line of Antiviral Defense.
JF  - Annual review of virology
VL  - 1
SP  - 261
EP  - 283
AB  - Animal cells use a wide variety of mechanisms to slow or prevent replication of viruses. These mechanisms are usually mediated by antiviral proteins whose expression and activities can be constitutive but are frequently amplified by interferon induction. Among these interferon-stimulated proteins, members of the IFITM (interferon-induced transmembrane) family are unique because they prevent infection before a virus can traverse the lipid bilayer of the cell. At least three human IFITM proteins-IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3-have antiviral activities. These activities limit infection in cultured cells by many viruses, including dengue virus, Ebola virus, influenza A virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and West Nile virus. Murine Ifitm3 controls influenza A virus infection in vivo, and polymorphisms in human IFITM3 correlate with the severity of both seasonal and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Here we review the discovery and characterization of the IFITM proteins, describe the spectrum of their antiviral activities, and discuss potential mechanisms underlying these effects.

TI  - IFITM3‐containing exosome as a novel mediator for anti‐viral response in dengue virus infection
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 17
SP  - 105
EP  - 118
AB  - Interferon‐inducible transmembrane proteins 1, 2 and 3 (IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3) have recently been identified as potent antiviral effectors that function to suppress the entry of a broad range of enveloped viruses and modulate cellular tropism independent of viral receptor expression. However, the antiviral effect and mechanisms of IFITMs in response to viral infections remain incompletely understood and characterized. In this work, we focused our investigation on the function of the extracellular IFITM3 protein. In cell models of DENV‐2 infection, we found that IFITM3 contributed to both the baseline and interferon‐induced inhibition of DENV entry. Most importantly, our study for the first time demonstrated the presence of IFITM‐containing exosome in the extracellular environment, and identified an ability of cellular exosome to intercellularly deliver IFITM3 and thus transmit its antiviral effect from infected to non‐infected cells. Thus, our findings provide new insights in the basic mechanisms underlying the actions of IFITM3, which might lead to future development of exosome‐mediated anti‐viral strategies using IFITM3 as a therapeutic agent. Conceivably, variations in the basal and inducible levels of IFITMs, as well as in intracellular and extracellular levels of IFITMs, might predict the severity of dengue virus infections among individuals or across species.

TI  - IFN-γ Production Depends on IL-12 and IL-18 Combined Action and Mediates Host Resistance to Dengue Virus Infection in a Nitric Oxide-Dependent Manner
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 5
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by one of four serotypes of Dengue virus (DENV-1–4). Severe dengue infection in humans is characterized by thrombocytopenia, increased vascular permeability, hemorrhage and shock. However, there is little information about host response to DENV infection. Here, mechanisms accounting for IFN-γ production and effector function during dengue disease were investigated in a murine model of DENV-2 infection. IFN-γ expression was greatly increased after infection of mice and its production was preceded by increase in IL-12 and IL-18 levels. In IFN-γ−/− mice, DENV-2-associated lethality, viral loads, thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, and liver injury were enhanced, when compared with wild type-infected mice. IL-12p40−/− and IL-18−/− infected-mice showed decreased IFN-γ production, which was accompanied by increased disease severity, higher viral loads and enhanced lethality. Blockade of IL-18 in infected IL-12p40−/− mice resulted in complete inhibition of IFN-γ production, greater DENV-2 replication, and enhanced disease manifestation, resembling the response seen in DENV-2-infected IFN-γ−/− mice. Reduced IFN-γ production was associated with diminished Nitric Oxide-synthase 2 (NOS2) expression and NOS2−/− mice had elevated lethality, more severe disease evolution and increased viral load after DENV-2 infection. Therefore, IL-12/IL-18-induced IFN-γ production and consequent NOS2 induction are of major importance to host resistance against DENV infection.

TI  - IL-18: The Forgotten Cytokine in Dengue Immunopathogenesis
JF  - Journal of Immunology Research
VL  - 2021
AB  - Dengue fever is an infection by the dengue virus (DENV) transmitted by vector mosquitoes. It causes many infections in tropical and subtropical countries every year, thus posing a severe disease threat. Cytokine storms, one condition where many proinflammatory cytokines are mass-produced, might lead to cellular dysfunction in tissue/organ failures and often facilitate severe dengue disease in patients. Interleukin- (IL-) 18, similar to IL-1β, is a proinflammatory cytokine produced during inflammation following inflammasome activation. Inflammatory stimuli, including microbial infections, damage signals, and cytokines, all induce the production of IL-18. High serum IL-18 is remarkably correlated with severely ill dengue patients; however, its possible roles have been less explored. Based on the clinical and basic findings, this review discusses the potential immunopathogenic role of IL-18 when it participates in DENV infection and dengue disease progression based on existing findings and related past studies.

TI  - IL8 release, tight junction and cytoskeleton dynamic reorganization conducive to permeability increase are induced by dengue virus infection of microvascular endothelial monolayers.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 85 Pt 7
SP  - 1801
EP  - 13
AB  - Permeability alterations of microvascular endothelia may be a factor in the plasma leakage produced by dengue virus infection. Confluent monolayers of the human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1 were utilized as an experimental model to study the cellular responses induced by the virus. Infected monolayers showed increased permeability for [(3)H]mannitol, but no changes were observed for 4-70 kDa dextrans at 48 h post-infection (p.i.), a time at which viral titres reached maximal values and 40 % of the cells expressed viral proteins. A further increase in permeability occurred at 72 h, still without evident cytopathic effects on the monolayer. Coinciding with this, actin was reorganized in the infected cells and the tight junction protein occludin was displaced to the cytoplasm. Increments in the thickness of stress fibres and focal adhesions were observed in uninfected cells neighbouring infected cells. Culture medium from infected monolayers induced permeability changes and thickening of actin-containing structures in control cultures that resembled those observed 48 h p.i. Interleukin (IL) 8 was found in culture medium at concentrations ranging from 20 to 100 pg ml(-1). Neutralizing antibodies against IL8 partially inhibited the changes produced by the culture medium as well as those induced by addition of IL8. Genistein inhibited the effect of the culture medium and the phosphorylation of proteins associated with focal adhesions and indicated the participation of tyrosine kinases. These findings suggest that IL8 production by infected monolayers contributes to the virus-induced effect on the cytoskeleton and tight junctions and thereby modifies transendothelial permeability.

TI  - IL‐22 modulates IL‐17A production and controls inflammation and tissue damage in experimental dengue infection
JF  - European Journal of Immunology
VL  - 43
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito‐borne flavivirus, is a public health problem in many tropical countries. IL‐22 and IL‐17A are key cytokines in several infectious and inflammatory diseases. We have assessed the contribution of IL‐22 and IL‐17A in the pathogenesis of experimental dengue infection using a mouse‐adapted DENV serotype 2 strain (P23085) that causes a disease that resembles severe dengue in humans. We show that IL‐22 and IL‐17A are produced upon DENV‐2 infection in immune‐competent mice. Infected IL‐22−/− mice had increased lethality, neutrophil accumulation and pro‐inflammatory cytokines in tissues, notably IL‐17A. Viral load was increased in spleen and liver of infected IL‐22−/− mice. There was also more severe liver injury, as seen by increased transaminases levels and tissue histopathology. γδ T cells and NK cells are sources of IL‐17A and IL‐22, respectively, in liver and spleen. We also show that DENV‐infected HepG2 cells treated with rhIL‐22 had reduced cell death and decreased IL‐6 production. IL‐17RA−/− mice were protected upon infection and IL‐17A‐neutralizing‐Ab‐treatment partially reversed the phenotype observed in IL‐22−/−‐infected mice. We suggest that disrupting the balance between IL‐22 and IL‐17A levels may represent an important strategy to reduce inflammation and tissue injury associated with severe dengue infection.

TI  - IRAV (FLJ11286), an Interferon-Stimulated Gene with Antiviral Activity against Dengue Virus, Interacts with MOV10
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus and can cause severe febrile illness. Here, we show that FLJ11286, which we refer to as IRAV, is induced by DENV in an interferon-dependent manner, displays antiviral activity against DENV, and localizes to the DENV replication complex. IRAV is an RNA binding protein and localizes to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies) in uninfected cells, where it interacts with the MOV10 RISC complex RNA helicase, suggesting a role for IRAV in the processing of viral RNA. After DENV infection, IRAV, along with MOV10 and Xrn1, localizes to the DENV replication complex and associates with DENV proteins. Depletion of IRAV or MOV10 results in an increase in viral RNA. These data serve to characterize an interferon-stimulated gene with antiviral activity against DENV, as well as to propose a mechanism of activity involving the processing of viral RNA. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus, a member of the family Flaviviridae, can result in a life-threatening illness and has a significant impact on global health. Dengue virus has been shown to be particularly sensitive to the effects of type I interferon; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which interferon-stimulated genes function to inhibit viral replication. A better understanding of the interferon-mediated antiviral response to dengue virus may aid in the development of novel therapeutics. Here, we examine the influence of the interferon-stimulated gene IRAV (FLJ11286) on dengue virus replication. We show that IRAV associates with P bodies in uninfected cells and with the dengue virus replication complex after infection. IRAV also interacts with MOV10, depletion of which is associated with increased viral replication. Our results provide insight into a newly identified antiviral gene, as well as broadening our understanding of the innate immune response to dengue virus infection.

TI  - ISG15 facilitates cellular antiviral response to dengue and west nile virus infection in vitro
AB  - BackgroundDengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV), close siblings of the Flaviviridae family, are the causative agents of Dengue hemorraghic shock or West Nile meningoencephalitis respectively. Vaccines against these two flaviviruses are currently unavailable. Interferon- Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), encoding an ubiquitin-like protein, is significantly induced by type I interferons or viral infections. Its roles in viral infections, however, vary with viruses, being either anti- or pro-viral. The exact roles of ISG15 in DENV and WNV infections remain unknown. In the current study, we evaluated the relevancies of ISG15 to DENV and WNV infection of a mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7.FindingsQuantitative PCR showed that mouse Isg15 was dramatically induced in DENV or WNV- infected RAW264.7 cells compared with non-infected cells. Isg15 and two other Jak-Stat related genes, Socs1 and Socs3, were silenced using siRNA mediated RNA interference. The intracellular DENV and WNV loads, as determined by quantitative PCR, were significantly higher in Isg15 silenced cells than control cells. The expression levels of interferon beta 1 (Ifnb1) were increased significantly in Isg15, Socs1 or Socs3 siRNA treated cells. Further investigation indicated that protein modification by ISG15, so called ISGylation, was significantly enhanced in DENV-infected cells compared to that in non-infected cells.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that ISG15 plays an anti-DENV/WNV function via protein ISGylation.

TI  - ISG15/USP18/STAT2 is a molecular hub regulating IFN I-mediated control of Dengue and Zika virus replication
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 15
AB  - The establishment of a virus infection is the result of the pathogen's ability to replicate in a hostile environment generated by the host's immune system. Here, we found that ISG15 restricts Dengue and Zika viruses' replication through the stabilization of its binding partner USP18. ISG15 expression was necessary to control DV replication driven by both autocrine and paracrine type one interferon (IFN-I) signaling. Moreover, USP18 competes with NS5-mediated STAT2 degradation, a major mechanism for establishment of flavivirus infection. Strikingly, reconstitution of USP18 in ISG15-deficient cells was sufficient to restore the STAT2's stability and restrict virus growth, suggesting that the IFNAR-mediated ISG15 activity is also antiviral. Our results add a novel layer of complexity in the virus/host interaction interface and suggest that NS5 has a narrow window of opportunity to degrade STAT2, therefore suppressing host's IFN-I mediated response and promoting virus replication.

TI  - Identification and characterization of Aedes albopictus long noncoding RNAs provides insights into their roles in development and flavivirus infection
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Aedes albopictus (Ae. albopictus) is an important vector of arboviruses such as Dengue virus (DENV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) have been identified in other vectors including Aedes aegypti and Anopheles mosquitoes, few of which have been implicated in immunity and viral replication. To identify lncRNAs with potential biological functions in Ae. albopictus, we performed RNA-seq on Ae. albopictus cells infected with DENV and ZIKV, and analyzed them together with public datasets. We identified a total of 23,899 transcripts, 16,089 were intergenic while 3,126 and 4,183 of them were antisense and intronic to annotated genes respectively. Ae. albopictus lncRNAs shared many of the characteristics with their invertebrate and vertebrate counterparts, such as low expression, low GC content, short in length, and low conservation even among closely related species. Compared to protein-coding genes, lncRNAs exhibited higher tendency to be expressed in a stage-specific manner. Besides, expression of lncRNAs and nearest protein-coding genes tended to be correlated, especially for the gene pairs within 1kb from each other. We also discovered that Ae. albopictus lncRNAs have the potential to act as precursors for miRNA and piRNAs, both of which have been implicated in antiviral defense in Aedes mosquito. Upon flavivirus infection, lncRNAs were observed to be differentially expressed, which possibly indicates the involvement of lncRNAs in the host-antiviral defense. Our study provides the first systematic identification of lncRNAs in Ae. albopictus, hence, offering a foundation for future studies of lncRNA functions.

AB  - The interaction between cell surface receptors and the envelope glycoprotein (EGP) on the viral membrane surface is the initial step of Dengue virus infection. To understand the host range, tissue tropism, and virulence of this pathogen, it is critical to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the interaction of EGP with receptor molecules. Here, using a TLC/virus-binding assay, we isolated and characterized a carbohydrate molecule on mammalian cell surfaces that is recognized by dengue virus type 2 (DEN2). Structural determination by immunochemical methods showed that the carbohydrate structure of the purified glycosphingolipid was neolactotetraosylceramide (nLc4Cer). This glycosphingolipid was expressed on the cell surface of susceptible cells, such as human erythroleukemia K562 and baby hamster kidney BHK-21. All serotypes of DEN viruses, DEN1 to DEN4, reacted with nLc4Cer, and the non-reducing terminal disaccharide residue Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1- was found to be a critical determinant for the binding of DEN2. Chemically synthesized derivatives carrying multiple carbohydrate residues of nLc4, but not nLc4 oligosaccharide, inhibited DEN2 infection of BHK-21 cells. These findings strongly suggested that multivalent nLc4 oligosaccharide could act as a competitive inhibitor against the binding of DEN2 to the host cells.

TI  - Identification and characterization of host proteins bound to dengue virus 3′ UTR reveal an antiviral role for quaking proteins
JF  - RNA
VL  - 24
SP  - 803
EP  - 814
AB  - The four dengue viruses (DENV1-4) are rapidly reemerging infectious RNA viruses. These positive-strand viral genomes contain structured 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) that interact with various host RNA binding proteins (RBPs). These RBPs are functionally important in viral replication, pathogenesis, and defense against host immune mechanisms. Here, we combined RNA chromatography and quantitative mass spectrometry to identify proteins interacting with DENV1-4 3′ UTRs. As expected, RBPs displayed distinct binding specificity. Among them, we focused on quaking (QKI) because of its preference for the DENV4 3′ UTR (DENV-4/SG/06K2270DK1/2005). RNA immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that QKI interacted with DENV4 genomes in infected cells. Moreover, QKI depletion enhanced infectious particle production of DENV4. On the contrary, QKI did not interact with DENV2 3′ UTR, and DENV2 replication was not affected consistently by QKI depletion. Next, we mapped the QKI interaction site and identified a QKI response element (QRE) in DENV4 3′ UTR. Interestingly, removal of QRE from DENV4 3′ UTR abolished this interaction and increased DENV4 viral particle production. Introduction of the QRE to DENV2 3′ UTR led to QKI binding and reduced DENV2 infectious particle production. Finally, reporter assays suggest that QKI reduced translation efficiency of viral RNA. Our work describes a novel function of QKI in restricting viral replication.

TI  - Identification and characterization of the role of c-terminal Src kinase in dengue virus replication
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 6
AB  - We screened a siRNA library targeting human tyrosine kinases in Huh-7 cells and identified c-terminal Src kinase (Csk) as one of the kinases involved in dengue virus replication. Knock-down of Csk expression by siRNAs or inhibition of Csk by an inhibitor reduced dengue virus RNA levels but did not affect viral entry. Csk partially colocalized with viral replication compartments. Dengue infection was drastically reduced in cells lacking the three ubiquitous src family kinases, Src, Fyn and Yes. Csk knock-down in these cells failed to block dengue virus replication suggesting that the effect of Csk is via regulation of Src family kinases. Csk was found to be hyper-phosphorylated during dengue infection and inhibition of protein kinase A led to a block in Csk phosphorylation and dengue virus replication. Overexpression studies suggest an important role for the kinase and SH3 domains in this process. Our results identified a novel role for Csk as a host tyrosine kinase involved in dengue virus replication and provide further insights into the role of host factors in dengue replication.

TI  - Identification and computational analysis of conserved YXXΦ motifs in the pan-serotypes of dengue virus NS5 protein and their implications in host-virus interactions.
JF  - Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics
SP  - 1
EP  - 14
AB  - Dengue is a major global health challenge, caused by the dengue virus (DENV) and transmitted through the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The four DENV serotypes (DENV1-4) infect about 400 million people annually. The non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is the most conserved DENV protein, crucial for viral replication. This study aims to elucidate the replication and pathogenesis mechanisms of DENV by targeting tyrosine-based motifs and YXXΦ-like tetrapeptides in the NS5 protein across all serotypes. We employed computational tools to identify and analyze tyrosine-based motifs (TM) and YXXΦ-like tetrapeptides within the NS5 protein. The structural characteristics of these motifs were determined using the AlphaFold2 web server. Additionally, we investigated post-translational modifications (PTMs) within these motifs to assess their potential roles in pathogenesis and immune response. Our analysis revealed various TM and YXXΦ-like tetrapeptides structurally conserved across the DENV serotypes. Several PTM sites were identified within these motifs, suggesting their involvement in virulence, enhanced propagation, and modulating the host immune system. The identified TM and tetrapeptides hold significant promise as targets for vaccine development against DENV. They potentially regulate key viral functions and immune evasion mechanisms. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis of conserved TM and YXXΦ-like tetrapeptides revealed distinct stability patterns. However, further in vivo and in vitro studies are needed to validate these findings and fully explore their therapeutic potential.

TI  - Identification and purification of a receptor on macrophages for the dengue virus‐induced suppressor cytokine
JF  - Clinical & Experimental Immunology
VL  - 91
AB  - Dengue type 2 virus (DV)‐induced suppressor cylokine (SF) binds to macrophages to transmit the suppressor signal to recruit the second subpopulation of suppressor T cells. The present study was undertaken to identify and purify the receptor for SF(SF‐R) on macrophages. The binding of 1251‐SF to macrophages was saturable and reversible. Scatchard analysis showed the presence of both high (54 000/cell) and low (178 × 106/cell) affinity receptor sites. The binding of 125I‐SF to macrophages was inhibited by pretreatment of macrophages with anti‐SF antiseruin but not by a heterologous antiserum. Normal mouse peritoneal macrophage membrane was solubilized withTriton‐X‐100 and the components separated by low pressure liquid chromatography (LPLC) to purify SF‐R. The presence of SF binding moiety (SF‐R) was screened at each step of purification. The purified SF‐R resolved into two bands of 45–50 kD mol. wt on SDS‐PAGE. 125I‐SF + SF‐R complex run on SDS‐PAGE showed a single band at about 55–60 kD mol. wt by autoradiography. Anti‐SF‐R anti serum reacted with SF‐R in a Western blot test; the reaction was abolished by pretreatment of the blots with proteinase K, but not by pretreatment with periodic acid. SF‐R was composed of two polypeptide chains (α and β) which were obtained in pure form by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of dithiothreitol‐ and iodoacetamide‐treated SF‐R. Only the β chain bound SK.

TI  - Identification and validation of ferroptosis-related genes in patients infected with dengue virus: implication in the pathogenesis of DENV
JF  - Virus Genes
VL  - 59
SP  - 377
EP  - 390
AB  - Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, has been associated with many virus infections. However, the role of ferroptosis in dengue virus (DENV) infection remains to be clarified. In our study, a dengue fever microarray dataset (GSE51808) of whole blood samples was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and a list of ferroptosis related genes (FRGs) was extracted from the FerrDb. We identified 37 ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (FR-DEGs) in DENV-infected patient blood samples compared to healthy individuals. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses as well as protein–protein interaction (PPI) network of FR-DEGs revealed that these 37 FR-DEGs were mainly related to the C-type lectin receptor and p53 signaling pathway. Nine out of the 37 FR-DEGs (HSPA5, CAV1, HRAS, PTGS2, JUN, IL6, ATF3, XBP1, and CDKN2A) were hub genes, of which 5 were validated by qRT-PCR in DENV-infected HepG2 cells. Finally, using miRNA-mRNA regulatory network, we identified has-miR-124-3p and has-miR-16-5p as the most critical miRNAs in regulating the expression of these hub genes. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that 5 FR-DEGs, JUN, IL6, ATF3, XBP1, and CDKN2A, and two miRNAs, has-miR-124-3p and has-miR-16-5p may implicate an essential role of ferroptosis in DENV infection, and further studies are warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Identification of Aedes aegypti Long Intergenic Non-coding RNAs and Their Association with Wolbachia and Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 10
AB  - Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are appearing as an important class of regulatory RNAs with a variety of biological functions. The aim of this study was to identify the lincRNA profile in the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and evaluate their potential role in host-pathogen interaction. The majority of previous RNA-Seq transcriptome studies in Ae. aegypti have focused on the expression pattern of annotated protein coding genes under different biological conditions. Here, we used 35 publically available RNA-Seq datasets with relatively high depth to screen the Ae. aegypti genome for lincRNA discovery. This led to the identification of 3,482 putative lincRNAs. These lincRNA genes displayed a slightly lower GC content and shorter transcript lengths compared to protein-encoding genes. Ae. aegypti lincRNAs also demonstrate low evolutionary sequence conservation even among closely related species such as Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae. We examined their expression in dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and Wolbachia infected and non-infected adult mosquitoes and Aa20 cells. The results revealed that DENV-2 infection increased the abundance of a number of host lincRNAs, from which some suppress viral replication in mosquito cells. RNAi-mediated silencing of lincRNA_1317 led to enhancement in viral replication, which possibly indicates its potential involvement in the host anti-viral defense. A number of lincRNAs were also differentially expressed in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. The results will facilitate future studies to unravel the function of lncRNAs in insects and may prove to be beneficial in developing new ways to control vectors or inhibit replication of viruses in them.

TI  - Identification of Aedes aegypti salivary gland proteins interacting with human immune receptor proteins
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 16
AB  - Mosquito saliva proteins modulate the human immune and hemostatic systems and control mosquito-borne pathogenic infections. One mechanism through which mosquito proteins may influence host immunity and hemostasis is their interactions with key human receptor proteins that may act as receptors for or coordinate attacks against invading pathogens. Here, using pull-down assays and proteomics-based mass spectrometry, we identified 11 Ae. aegypti salivary gland proteins (SGPs) (e.g., apyrase, Ae. aegypti venom allergen-1 [AaVA-1], neutrophil stimulating protein 1 [NeSt1], and D7 proteins), that interact with one or more of five human receptor proteins (cluster of differentiation 4 [CD4], CD14, CD86, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin [DC-SIGN], and Toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4]). We focused on CD4- and DC-SIGN-interacting proteins and confirmed that CD4 directly interacts with AaVA-1, D7, and NeST1 recombinant proteins and that AaVA-1 showed a moderate interaction with DC-SIGN using ELISA. Bacteria responsive protein 1 (AgBR1), an Ae. aegypti saliva protein reported to enhance ZIKV infection in humans but that was not identified in our pull-down assay moderately interacts with CD4 in the ELISA assay. Functionally, we showed that AaVA-1 and NeST1 proteins promoted activation of CD4+ T cells. We propose the possible impact of these interactions and effects on mosquito-borne viral infections such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. Overall, this study provides key insight into the vector-host (protein-protein) interaction network and suggests roles for these interactions in mosquito-borne viral infections.

TI  - Identification of Antiviral Roles for the Exon-Junction Complex and Nonsense-Mediated Decay in Flaviviral Infection
JF  - Nature microbiology
VL  - 4
SP  - 985
EP  - 995
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, related to dengue virus and Zika virus. To gain insight into host pathways involved in WNV infection, we performed a systematic affinity-tag purification mass spectrometry (APMS) study to identify 259 WNV-interacting human proteins. RNA interference screening revealed 26 genes that both interact with WNV proteins and influence WNV infection. We found that WNV, dengue and Zika virus capsids interact with a conserved subset of proteins that impact infection. These include the exon–junction complex (EJC) recycling factor PYM1, which is antiviral against all three viruses. The EJC has roles in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), and we found that both the EJC and NMD are antiviral and the EJC protein RBM8A directly binds WNV RNA. To counteract this, flavivirus infection inhibits NMD and the capsid–PYM1 interaction interferes with EJC protein function and localization. Depletion of PYM1 attenuates RBM8A binding to viral RNA, suggesting that WNV sequesters PYM1 to protect viral RNA from decay. Together, these data suggest a complex interplay between the virus and host in regulating NMD and the EJC. Proteomic analysis coupled to RNA interference screening identifies the host exon–junction complex recycling factor partner of Y14 and mago (PYM1) as antiviral against three flaviruses, whose capsids interact with PYM1 and interfere with its ability to trigger nonsense-mediated decay-dependent degradation of viral RNA.

TI  - Identification of Cis-Acting Elements in the 3′-Untranslated Region of the Dengue Virus Type 2 RNA That Modulate Translation and Replication*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 286
SP  - 22521
EP  - 22534
AB  - Using the massively parallel genetic algorithm for RNA folding, we show that the core region of the 3′-untranslated region of the dengue virus (DENV) RNA can form two dumbbell structures (5′- and 3′-DBs) of unequal frequencies of occurrence. These structures have the propensity to form two potential pseudoknots between identical five-nucleotide terminal loops 1 and 2 (TL1 and TL2) and their complementary pseudoknot motifs, PK2 and PK1. Mutagenesis using a DENV2 replicon RNA encoding the Renilla luciferase reporter indicated that all four motifs and the conserved sequence 2 (CS2) element within the 3′-DB are important for replication. However, for translation, mutation of TL1 alone does not have any effect; TL2 mutation has only a modest effect in translation, but translation is reduced by ∼60% in the TL1/TL2 double mutant, indicating that TL1 exhibits a cooperative synergy with TL2 in translation. Despite the variable contributions of individual TL and PK motifs in translation, WT levels are achieved when the complementarity between TL1/PK2 and TL2/PK1 is maintained even under conditions of inhibition of the translation initiation factor 4E function mediated by LY294002 via a noncanonical pathway. Taken together, our results indicate that the cis-acting RNA elements in the core region of DENV2 RNA that include two DB structures are required not only for RNA replication but also for optimal translation.

TI  - Identification of Five Interferon-Induced Cellular Proteins That Inhibit West Nile Virus and Dengue Virus Infections
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 8332
EP  - 8341
AB  - ABSTRACT Interferons (IFNs) are key mediators of the host innate antiviral immune response. To identify IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that instigate an antiviral state against two medically important flaviviruses, West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV), we tested 36 ISGs that are commonly induced by IFN-α for antiviral activity against the two viruses. We discovered that five ISGs efficiently suppressed WNV and/or DENV infection when they were individually expressed in HEK293 cells. Mechanistic analyses revealed that two structurally related cell plasma membrane proteins, IFITM2 and IFITM3, disrupted early steps (entry and/or uncoating) of the viral infection. In contrast, three IFN-induced cellular enzymes, viperin, ISG20, and double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase, inhibited steps in viral proteins and/or RNA biosynthesis. Our results thus imply that the antiviral activity of IFN-α is collectively mediated by a panel of ISGs that disrupt multiple steps of the DENV and WNV life cycles.

TI  - Identification of Key Residues in Dengue Virus NS1 Protein That Are Essential for Its Secretion
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is involved in multiple aspects of the DENV lifecycle. Importantly, it is secreted from infected cells as a hexameric lipoparticle that mediates vascular damage that is a hallmark of severe dengue. Although the secretion of NS1 is known to be important in DENV pathogenesis, the exact molecular features of NS1 that are required for its secretion from cells are not fully understood. In this study, we employed random point mutagenesis in the context of an NS1 expression vector encoding a C-terminal HiBiT luminescent peptide tag to identify residues within NS1 that are essential for its secretion. Using this approach, we identified 10 point mutations that corresponded with impaired NS1 secretion, with in silico analyses indicating that the majority of these mutations are located within the β-ladder domain. Additional studies on two of these mutants, V220D and A248V, revealed that they prevented viral RNA replication, while studies using a DENV NS1-NS5 viral polyprotein expression system demonstrated that these mutations resulted in a more reticular NS1 localisation pattern and failure to detect mature NS1 at its predicted molecular weight by Western blotting using a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody. Together, these studies demonstrate that the combination of a luminescent peptide tagged NS1 expression system with random point mutagenesis enables rapid identification of mutations that alter NS1 secretion. Two such mutations identified via this approach revealed residues that are essential for correct NS1 processing or maturation and viral RNA replication.

TI  - Identification of New Protein Interactions between Dengue Fever Virus and Its Hosts, Human and Mosquito
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 8
AB  - The four divergent serotypes of dengue virus are the causative agents of dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. About two-fifths of the world's population live in areas where dengue is prevalent, and thousands of deaths are caused by the viruses every year. Dengue virus is transmitted from one person to another primarily by the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Recent studies have begun to define how the dengue viral proteins interact with host proteins to mediate viral replication and pathogenesis. A combined analysis of these studies, however, suggests that many virus-host protein interactions remain to be identified, especially for the mosquito host. In this study, we used high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screening to identify mosquito and human proteins that physically interact with dengue proteins. We tested each identified host protein against the proteins from all four serotypes of dengue to identify interactions that are conserved across serotypes. We further confirmed many of the interactions using co-affinity purification assays. As in other large-scale screens, we identified some previously detected interactions and many new ones, moving us closer to a complete host - dengue protein interactome. To help summarize and prioritize the data for further study, we combined our interactions with other published data and identified a subset of the host-dengue interactions that are now supported by multiple forms of evidence. These data should be useful for understanding the interplay between dengue and its hosts and may provide candidates for drug targets and vector control strategies.

TI  - Identification of Proteins Bound to Dengue Viral RNA In Vivo Reveals New Host Proteins Important for Virus Replication
JF  - mBio
VL  - 7
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus is the most prevalent cause of arthropod-borne infection worldwide. Due to the limited coding capacity of the viral genome and the complexity of the viral life cycle, host cell proteins play essential roles throughout the course of viral infection. Host RNA-binding proteins mediate various aspects of virus replication through their physical interactions with viral RNA. Here we describe a technique designed to identify such interactions in the context of infected cells using UV cross-linking followed by antisense-mediated affinity purification and mass spectrometry. Using this approach, we identified interactions, several of them novel, between host proteins and dengue viral RNA in infected Huh7 cells. Most of these interactions were subsequently validated using RNA immunoprecipitation. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing, we showed that more than half of these host proteins are likely involved in regulating virus replication, demonstrating the utility of this method in identifying biologically relevant interactions that may not be identified using traditional in vitro approaches. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus is the most prevalent cause of arthropod-borne infection worldwide. Viral RNA molecules physically interact with cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) throughout the course of infection; the identification of such interactions will lead to the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of virus replication. Until now, the identification of host proteins bound to dengue viral RNA has been accomplished using in vitro strategies. Here, we used a method for the specific purification of dengue viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes from infected cells and subsequently identified the associated proteins by mass spectrometry. We then validated a functional role for the majority of these proteins in mediating efficient virus replication. This approach has broad relevance to virology and RNA biology, as it could theoretically be used to purify any viral RNP complex of interest.

AB  - Purpose : To identify protein targets in host (vero) cell since there is currently no therapy or a licensed tetravalent vaccine to combat all the four virus serotypes of dengue virus. Methods : The domain III of the dengue virus encoded envelope protein was expressed in pET28a expression vector and the purified recombinant protein was labeled with biotin without altering its immunogenicity. Vero cell proteins on nitrocellulose membrane reacted with recombinant envelope protein domain III to identify viral target proteins in vero cells. Results : The 45 KDa, 43 KDa and 30 KDa plasma membrane proteins were identified as viral envelope targets. Competitive binding assay showed these proteins competing with dengue virus binding. MTT assay indicate that viability of vero cells increases in cultures pretreated with 45 KDa, 43 KDa and 30 KDa proteins before dengue infection. Conclusion : These results indicate the possible role of these proteins in viral binding to vero cells. The study provides a preliminary insight that would aid in determining the target epitopes against protein E domain III of dengue virus and hence, formulation of a vaccine for preparing neutralizing antibodies.

TI  - Identification of RNA Binding Proteins Associated with Dengue Virus RNA in Infected Cells Reveals Temporally Distinct Host Factor Requirements
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 10
AB  - Background There are currently no vaccines or antivirals available for dengue virus infection, which can cause dengue hemorrhagic fever and death. A better understanding of the host pathogen interaction is required to develop effective therapies to treat DENV. In particular, very little is known about how cellular RNA binding proteins interact with viral RNAs. RNAs within cells are not naked; rather they are coated with proteins that affect localization, stability, translation and (for viruses) replication. Methodology/Principal Findings Seventy-nine novel RNA binding proteins for dengue virus (DENV) were identified by cross-linking proteins to dengue viral RNA during a live infection in human cells. These cellular proteins were specific and distinct from those previously identified for poliovirus, suggesting a specialized role for these factors in DENV amplification. Knockdown of these proteins demonstrated their function as viral host factors, with evidence for some factors acting early, while others late in infection. Their requirement by DENV for efficient amplification is likely specific, since protein knockdown did not impair the cell fitness for viral amplification of an unrelated virus. The protein abundances of these host factors were not significantly altered during DENV infection, suggesting their interaction with DENV RNA was due to specific recruitment mechanisms. However, at the global proteome level, DENV altered the abundances of proteins in particular classes, including transporter proteins, which were down regulated, and proteins in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which were up regulated. Conclusions/Significance The method for identification of host factors described here is robust and broadly applicable to all RNA viruses, providing an avenue to determine the conserved or distinct mechanisms through which diverse viruses manage the viral RNA within cells. This study significantly increases the number of cellular factors known to interact with DENV and reveals how DENV modulates and usurps cellular proteins for efficient amplification.

TI  - Identification of Residues in the Dengue Virus Type 2 NS2B Cofactor That Are Critical for NS3 Protease Activation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 13708
EP  - 13716
AB  - ABSTRACT Proteolytic processing of the dengue virus polyprotein is mediated by host cell proteases and the virus-encoded NS2B-NS3 two-component protease. The NS3 protease represents an attractive target for the development of antiviral inhibitors. The three-dimensional structure of the NS3 protease domain has been determined, but the structural determinants necessary for activation of the enzyme by the NS2B cofactor have been characterized only to a limited extent. To test a possible functional role of the recently proposed Φx3Φ motif in NS3 protease activation, we targeted six residues within the NS2B cofactor by site-specific mutagenesis. Residues Trp62, Ser71, Leu75, Ile77, Thr78, and Ile79 in NS2B were replaced with alanine, and in addition, an L75A/I79A double mutant was generated. The effects of these mutations on the activity of the NS2B(H)-NS3pro protease were analyzed in vitro by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of autoproteolytic cleavage at the NS2B/NS3 site and by assay of the enzyme with the fluorogenic peptide substrate GRR-AMC. Compared to the wild type, the L75A, I77A, and I79A mutants demonstrated inefficient autoproteolysis, whereas in the W62A and the L75A/I79A mutants self-cleavage appeared to be almost completely abolished. With exception of the S71A mutant, which had a kcat/Km value for the GRR-AMC peptide similar to that of the wild type, all other mutants exhibited drastically reduced kcat values. These results indicate a pivotal function of conserved residues Trp62, Leu75, and Ile79 in the NS2B cofactor in the structural activation of the dengue virus NS3 serine protease.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 72
SP  - 7510
EP  - 7522
AB  - ABSTRACT The flavivirus genome is a positive-stranded ∼11-kb RNA including 5′ and 3′ noncoding regions (NCR) of approximately 100 and 400 to 600 nucleotides (nt), respectively. The 3′ NCR contains adjacent, thermodynamically stable, conserved short and long stem-and-loop structures (the 3′-SL), formed by the 3′-terminal ∼100 nt. The nucleotide sequences within the 3′-SL are not well conserved among species. We examined the requirement for the 3′-SL in the context of dengue virus type 2 (DEN2) replication by mutagenesis of an infectious cDNA copy of a DEN2 genome. Genomic full-length RNA was transcribed in vitro and used to transfect monkey kidney cells. A substitution mutation, in which the 3′-terminal 93 nt constituting the wild-type (wt) DEN2 3′-SL sequence were replaced by the 96-nt sequence of the West Nile virus (WN) 3′-SL, was sublethal for virus replication. An analysis of the growth phenotypes of additional mutant viruses derived from RNAs containing DEN2-WN chimeric 3′-SL structures suggested that the wt DEN2 nucleotide sequence forming the bottom half of the long stem and loop in the 3′-SL was required for viability. One 7-bp substitution mutation in this domain resulted in a mutant virus that grew well in monkey kidney cells but was severely restricted in cultured mosquito cells. In contrast, transpositions of and/or substitutions in the wt DEN2 nucleotide sequence in the top half of the long stem and in the short stem and loop were relatively well tolerated, provided the stem-loop secondary structure was conserved.

EP  - 17449
AB  - Dengue virus, an ∼10.7-kb positive-sense RNA virus, is the most common arthropod-communicated pathogen in the world. Despite dengue's clear epidemiological importance, mechanisms for its replication remain elusive. Here, we probed the entire dengue genome for interactions with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and we identified the dominant interaction as a loop-forming ACAG motif in the 3′ positive-stranded terminus, complicating the prevailing model of replication. A subset of interactions coincides with known flaviviral recombination sites inside the viral protein-coding region. Specific recognition of the RNA element occurs via an arginine patch in the C-terminal thumb domain of RdRp. We also show that the highly conserved nature of the consensus RNA motif may relate to its tolerance to various mutations in the interacting region of RdRp. Disruption of the interaction resulted in loss of viral replication ability in cells. This unique RdRp-RNA interface is found throughout flaviviruses, implying possibilities for broad disease interventions.

AB  - Infectious cDNA clones of RNA viruses are important research tools, but flavivirus cDNA clones have proven difficult to assemble and propagate in bacteria. This has been attributed to genetic instability and/or host cell toxicity, however the mechanism leading to these difficulties has not been fully elucidated. Here we identify and characterize an efficient cryptic bacterial promoter in the cDNA encoding the dengue virus (DENV) 5′ UTR. Following cryptic transcription in E. coli, protein expression initiated at a conserved in-frame AUG that is downstream from the authentic DENV initiation codon, yielding a DENV polyprotein fragment that was truncated at the N-terminus. A more complete understanding of constitutive viral protein expression in E. coli might help explain the cloning and propagation difficulties generally observed with flavivirus cDNA.

TI  - Identification of a Putative Coreceptor on Vero Cells That Participates in Dengue 4 Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 75
SP  - 7818
EP  - 7827
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus infects target cells by attaching to a cell surface receptor through the envelope (E) glycoprotein, located on the surface of the viral membrane. On Vero and BHK cells, heparan sulfate (HS) moieties of proteoglycans are the receptors for dengue virus; however, additional proteins have also been described as putative dengue virus receptors on C6/36, HL60, and BM cells. HS can also act as a receptor for other types of viruses or as an attachment molecule for viruses that require additional host cell molecules to allow viral penetration. In this study we searched for molecules other than HS that could participate in dengue virus infection of Vero cells. Labeled dengue 4 virus bound with high affinity to two molecules of 74 and 44 kDa. Binding of dengue virus to the 74-kDa molecule was susceptible to protease and sodium periodate treatment and resistant to heparinase treatments. Lectins such as concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin prevented dengue virus binding to both the 74- and the 44-kDa protein in overlay assays, while phytohemagglutinin P did not affect binding, suggesting that carbohydrate residues (α-mannose orN-acetylglucosamine) are important in virus binding to host cells. Protease susceptibility, biotin labeling, and immunofluorescence with a polyclonal antibody raised against the 74-kDa protein consistently identified the protein on the surfaces of Vero cells. Moreover, the antibody against the 74-kDa protein was able to inhibit dengue virus infection. These data suggest that HS might serve as a primary receptor, probably concentrating virus particles on the surfaces of Vero cells, and then other molecules, such as the 74-kDa protein, might participate as coreceptors in viral penetration. The 74-kDa protein possibly constitutes part of a putative receptor complex for dengue virus infection of Vero cells.

AB  - The establishment of a productive dengue virus (DENV) infection in the midgut epithelial cells of Aedes aegypti is critical for the viral transmission cycle. The hypothesis that DENV virions interact directly with specific mosquito midgut proteins was explored. We found that DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) pretreated with trypsin interacted with a single 31 kDa protein, identified as AAEL011180 by protein mass spectrometry. This putative receptor is a highly conserved protein and has orthologs in culicine and anopheline mosquitoes. We confirmed that impairing the expression of AAEL011180 in the midgut of Ae. aegypti females abolished the interaction with DENV2, and the virus also bound to immobilized recombinant purified receptor. Furthermore, recombinant DENV2 surface E glycoprotein bound to recombinant AAEL011180 with high affinity (38.2 nM) in binding kinetic analysis using surface plasmon resonance. The gene for this DENV2 E protein receptor (EPrRec) was disrupted, but since the gene is essential in Ae. aegypti, only heterozygote knockout (ΔEPrRec+/-) females could be recovered. Further reducing EPrRec mRNA expression in the midgut of ΔEPrRec+/- females by systemic dsRNA injection significantly reduced the prevalence of DENV2 midgut infection. EPrRec also interacts with heat shock protein 70 cognate 3 (Hsc70-3), and silencing Hsc70-3 expression in ΔEPrRec females also reduced the prevalence of DENV2 midgut infection.

AB  - A genomic-length cDNA clone corresponding to the RNA of dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2) New Guinea C strain (NGC) was constructed in a low copy number vector. The cloned cDNA was stably propagated in Escherichia coil and designated pDVWS501. RNA transcripts produced in vitro from the cDNA using T7 RNA polymerase yielded infectious virus (MON501) upon electroporation into BHK-21 cells. When compared with parental NGC virus, MON501 replicated to similar levels in Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells and showed similar neurovirulence in suckling mice. In contrast, a second genomic-length cDNA clone (pDVWS310) used as an intermediate in the construction of pDVWS501 produced virus (MON310) that replicated well in C6/36 cells but was not neurovirulent in mice. MON310 contained the prM and E genes of the non-neurovirulent PUO-218 strain in an NGC background. There were seven amino acid differences between the prM and E proteins of MON310 and MON501. The differences were generally conservative, with the exception of E residue 126, which was Glu in MON310 and Lys in MON501. To examine the role of this residue in mouse neurovirulence, substitutions of Glu --> Lys and Lys --> Glu were made in MON310 and MON501, respectively. The properties of these mutants clearly demonstrated that Lys at E residue 126 is a major determinant of DEN-2 mouse neurovirulence.

AB  - Dengue has emerged as the most important life-threatening illness in the world, especially in Asian countries around Hong Kong, where the incidence of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is much greater than other continents. However, little is known about molecular and cellular processes sustaining egress of dengue virus in the host cell. 
 
To better understand the viral and cellular determinants of dengue virus egress, we have established a dengue VLP producing stable cell line (HeLa-prME) and demonstrated that dengue VLP was able to mimic the budding and egress process of dengue viruses so that it constitutes a safe and convenient tool for the study of egress of dengue virus. Under the support of RFCID grant, HeLa-prME cells were used to screen a siRNA library that included 122 cellular membrane trafficking genes. 
 
Our screen results revealed that knockdown of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) 1 and ARF6 had significant effects on VLP production by HeLa-prME cell. Experiments with other ARF proteins, which were not included in the siRNA library, showed that the ARF4/ARF5 double knockdown could inhibit VLP production but had no effect on secretion of other proteins such as soluble dengue E protein, suggesting the specificity of their involvement in VLP production. Further experiments using real virus showed that the depletion of ARF4/5 by siRNA could significantly reduced the replication of dengue 1 virus, dengue 4 virus and yellow fever virus, confirming the important role of ARF4 and ARF5 for not only dengue viruses but also other flaviviruses. 
 
Our study uncovered the importance of class II ARFs in the egress of dengue virus. Results from this project provided information on mechanism of dengue virus assembly and its dependence on cellular machineries.

TI  - Identification of genetic variants associated with dengue or West Nile virus disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis
JF  - BMC Infectious Diseases
VL  - 18
AB  - BackgroundDengue and West Nile viruses are highly cross-reactive and have numerous parallels in geography, potential vector host (Aedes family of mosquitoes), and initial symptoms of infection. While the vast majority (> 80%) of both dengue and West Nile virus infections result in asymptomatic infections, a minority of individuals experience symptomatic infection and an even smaller proportion develop severe disease. The mechanisms by which these infections lead to severe disease in a subset of infected individuals is incompletely understood, but individual host differences including genetic factors and immune responses have been proposed. We sought to identify genetic risk factors that are associated with more severe disease outcomes for both viruses in order to shed light on possible shared mechanisms of resistance and potential therapeutic interventions.MethodsWe applied a search strategy using four major databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Global Health) to find all known genetic associations identified to date with dengue or West Nile virus disease. Here we present a review of our findings and a meta-analysis of genetic variants identified.ResultsWe found genetic variations that are significantly associated with infections of these viruses. In particular we found variation within the OAS1 (meta-OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.69–1.00) and CCR5 (meta-OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.08–1.53) genes is significantly associated with West Nile virus disease, while variation within MICB (meta-OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.68–3.29), PLCE1 (meta-OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.42–0.71), MBL2 (meta-OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.02–2.31), and IFN-γ (meta-OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.30–4.71), is associated with dengue disease.ConclusionsDespite substantial heterogeneity in populations studied, genes examined, and methodology, significant associations with genetic variants were found across studies within both diseases. These gene associations suggest a key role for immune mechanisms in susceptibility to severe disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of these genes in disease pathogenesis and may reveal additional genetic factors associated with disease severity.

TI  - Identification of host factors binding to dengue and Zika virus subgenomic RNA by efficient yeast three-hybrid screens of the human ORFeome
JF  - RNA Biology
VL  - 18
SP  - 732
EP  - 744
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses such as the dengue (DENV) and the Zika virus (ZIKV) are important human pathogens causing around 100 million symptomatic infections each year. During infection, small subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) are formed inside the infected host cell as a result of incomplete degradation of the viral RNA genome by cellular exoribonuclease XRN1. Although the full extent of sfRNA functions is to be revealed, these non-coding RNAs are key virulence factors and their detrimental effects on multiple cellular processes seem to consistently involve molecular interactions with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Discovery of such sfRNA-binding host-factors has followed established biochemical pull-down approaches skewed towards highly abundant proteins hampering proteome-wide coverage. Yeast three-hybrid (Y3H) systems represent an attractive alternative approach. To facilitate proteome-wide screens for RBP, we revisited and improved existing RNA-Y3H methodology by (1) implementing full-length ORF libraries in combination with (2) efficient yeast mating to increase screening depth and sensitivity, and (3) stringent negative controls to eliminate over-representation of non-specific RNA-binders. These improvements were validated employing the well-characterized interaction between DDX6 (DEAD-box helicase 6) and sfRNA of DENV as paradigm. Our advanced Y3H system was used to screen for human proteins binding to DENV and ZIKV sfRNA, resulting in a list of 69 putative sfRNA-binders, including several previously reported as well as numerous novel RBP host factors. Our methodology requiring no sophisticated infrastructure or analytic pipeline may be employed for the discovery of meaningful RNA–protein interactions at large scale in other fields.

TI  - Identification of microRNAs expressed in the midgut of Aedes albopictus during dengue infection
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 10
AB  - The midgut is the first barrier to dengue virus (DENV) infections of mosquitoes and therefore is a major bottleneck for the subsequent development of vector competence. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this barrier are unknown. We constructed three small RNA libraries from the midguts of adult Aedes albopictus females that had been fed on either sugar solution, an uninfected blood meal, or a blood meal infected with DENV-2, and112 conserved microRNAs represented by 173 miRNA sequences were identified, with 34 novel microRNAs predicted by Mireap, RNAfold and Sfold software. In addition, the expression of aal-miR-1174, aal-miR-2951 and aal-miR-956 was confirmed via stem-loop quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Compared with microRNA expression profiles of mosquitoes that had ingested a regular blood meal, 43 microRNAs were upregulated and 4were downregulated in mosquitoes that had ingested a DENV-2-infected blood meal. Among the differentially expressed microRNAs, miR-1767, miR-276-3p, miR-4448 and miR-4728-5p were verified via stem-loop qRT-PCR. Analyses indicated that the changing patterns in miRNA expression during DENV-2 infection were significant and varied at different time points post infection. Most miRNA were upregulated at 24 h but were downregulated at 48 h post DENV-2 intake. The aal-miR-4728-5p was chosen for an in vitro transient transfection assay, and the results show that this miRNA enhances DENV replication in C6/36 cells. This study provides the first information on microRNAs expressed in the midgut of Ae. albopictus and describes species-specific changes in their expression levels following infection by DENV-2.

JF  - BMC Genomics
VL  - 11
SP  - 119
EP  - 119
AB  - BackgroundMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in a variety of organisms, including insects, vertebrates, and plants. miRNAs play important roles in cell development and differentiation as well as in the cellular response to stress and infection. To date, there are limited reports of miRNA identification in mosquitoes, insects that act as essential vectors for the transmission of many human pathogens, including flaviviruses. West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus, members of the Flaviviridae family, are primarily transmitted by Aedes and Culex mosquitoes. Using high-throughput deep sequencing, we examined the miRNA repertoire in Ae. albopictus cells and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes.ResultsWe identified a total of 65 miRNAs in the Ae. albopictus C7/10 cell line and 77 miRNAs in Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, the majority of which are conserved in other insects such as Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. The most highly expressed miRNA in both mosquito species was miR-184, a miRNA conserved from insects to vertebrates. Several previously reported Anopheles miRNAs, including miR-1890 and miR-1891, were also found in Culex and Aedes, and appear to be restricted to mosquitoes. We identified seven novel miRNAs, arising from nine different precursors, in C7/10 cells and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, two of which have predicted orthologs in An. gambiae. Several of these novel miRNAs reside within a ~350 nt long cluster present in both Aedes and Culex. miRNA expression was confirmed by primer extension analysis. To determine whether flavivirus infection affects miRNA expression, we infected female Culex mosquitoes with WNV. Two miRNAs, miR-92 and miR-989, showed significant changes in expression levels following WNV infection.ConclusionsAedes and Culex mosquitoes are important flavivirus vectors. Recent advances in both mosquito genomics and high-throughput sequencing technologies enabled us to interrogate the miRNA profile in these two species. Here, we provide evidence for over 60 conserved and seven novel mosquito miRNAs, expanding upon our current understanding of insect miRNAs. Undoubtedly, some of the miRNAs identified will have roles not only in mosquito development, but also in mediating viral infection in the mosquito host.

VL  - 72 Pt 6
SP  - 795
EP  - 807
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) consists of a methyltransferase (MTase) domain and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. The cross-talk between these domains occurs via a ten-residue linker. Recent solution studies of DENV NS5 from all four serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4) showed that NS5 adopts multiple conformations owing to its flexible linker and that DENV-4 NS5 is more compact and less flexible compared with NS5 from DENV-1 to DENV-3 [Saw et al. (2015), Acta Cryst. D71, 2309-2327]. Here, using a variety of single, double, triple and quadruple mutants of DENV-4 NS5 combined with solution X-ray scattering studies, insight into the critical residues responsible for the differential flexibility of DENV-4 NS5 is presented. The DENV-4 NS5 mutants K271T and S266N/T267A as well as the deletion mutant ΔS266T267 showed enlarged dimensions and flexibility similar to those of DENV-3 NS5. The data indicate that the residues Lys271, Ser266 and Thr267 are important for the compactness of DENV-4 NS5 and therefore may be critical for the regulation of virus replication. Furthermore, quantitative characterization of the flexibility of these DENV-4 NS5 linker mutants using the ensemble-optimization method revealed that these mutants possess a similar conformational distribution to DENV-3 NS5, confirming that these residues in the linker region cause the higher compactness of DENV-4 NS5.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 85 Pt 8
SP  - 2307
EP  - 14
AB  - Dengue virus causes dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome with a high mortality rate. The genome of dengue virus is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA encoding three structural and seven non-structural proteins. The core protein is one of the three structural proteins and is the building block of the nucleocapsid of dengue virus. The core protein of dengue virus type 2 (DEN2) is composed of 100 aa with four alpha-helix domains. An internal hydrophobic domain located at aa 44-60 was identified. The DEN2 core protein was shown to form homodimers. Deletion of aa 1-36 or 73-100 decreased but did not completely abolish the core-to-core homotypic interaction, whereas deletion of a portion (aa 44-60) within aa 37-72 completely abolished the ability of the DEN2 core proteins to interact with each other. A recombinant DEN2 core protein corresponding to aa 37-72 was able to undergo homotypic interaction and bound to a native DEN2 core protein. The results of this study indicated that the homotypic interaction domain of the DEN2 core protein is located at aa 37-72 and that the internal hydrophobic domain located at aa 44-60 plays a pivotal role in core-to-core homotypic interaction.

VL  - 38
SP  - 5136
EP  - 5147
AB  - Abstract The Flavivirus genus comprise several important human pathogens, including dengue, West Nile, Yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. These enveloped viruses affect more than 2 billion people in the world, mainly in less developed countries. Although some vaccines exist for some flaviviruses, these vaccines are not universally available due to many factors and since their infections are a world-wide public health issue, the development of antiviral molecules is fundamental. Flavivirus membranes, through the help of the envelope E glycoprotein, fuse with endosomal compartments in a pH-dependent way to release their genome into the cytoplasm and require specific lipids, such as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), for efficient fusion. The fundamental role the envelope E protein has on viral entry and membrane fusion suggest that it is an essential antiviral target. In this work, we have used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the binding of the head-group of BMP to the tip of the envelope E proteins of ZIKV, DENV, TBEV and JEV viruses whose three-dimensional structures are known. Our results indicate that, apart from the fusion loop, there are different amino acid residues in different regions of the envelope E proteins of flaviviruses capable of binding the head-group of BMP. These regions should work together to accomplish the binding and fusion of the envelope and endosomal membranes and represent a new target to develop and design potent and effective antiviral agents capable of blocking flavivirus-endosome membrane fusion.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 71
SP  - 7246
EP  - 7252
AB  - Dengue viruses infect cells by attaching to a surface receptor, probably through the envelope (E) glycoprotein, located on the surface of the viral membrane. However, the identity of the dengue virus receptor in the mosquito and in mammalian host cells remains unknown. To identify and characterize the molecules responsible for binding dengue virus, overlay protein blot and binding assays were performed with labeled virus. Two glycoproteins of 40 and 45 kDa located on the surface of C6/36 cells bound dengue type 4 virus. Virus binding by total and membrane proteins obtained from trypsin-treated cells was inhibited, while neuraminidase treatment did not inhibit binding. Periodate treatment of cell proteins did not reduce virus binding, but it modified the molecular weight of the polypeptide detected by overlay assays. Preincubation of C6/36 cells with electroeluted 40- and 45-kDa proteins or with specific antibodies raised against these proteins inhibited virus binding. These results strongly suggest that the 40- and 45-kDa surface proteins are putative receptors or part of a receptor complex for dengue virus.

EP  - 8
AB  - Thrombocytopenia is frequently associated with dengue virus infection. Host factors such as anti-platelet immunopathogenic processes have been implicated in the origin of dengue-associated thrombocytopenia but the role of dengue virus in directly interacting with platelets and altering their hemostatic property remains incompletely understood. In the present study, we examined the effect of dengue 2 virus on the morphology and physiological activation profile of normal human platelets using atomic force microscopy, electron microscopy and flowcytometry. Platelets obtained from healthy donors were exposed to a cell culture-adapted 10(4) LD(50) dengue 2 virus isolate in vitro and the subsequent effect on morphology and activation biology studied. Our results show that dengue 2 virus exposure at doses comparable to natural viremic states in human infections can activate platelets with an increase in P-selectin expression and fibrinogen-binding property. Atomic force, scanning and transmission electron microscopy also showed typical activation-related morphological changes such as altered platelet membrane architecture, degranulation, presence of filopodia and dilatation of the open canalicular system in the dengue 2 virus-exposed platelets but not in the controls. Importantly, Japanese encephalitis virus exposure at the same dose did not activate platelets or show any morphological changes. Our findings suggest that dengue 2 virus may directly interact with and activate platelets - an event that might be important in the origin of dengue-associated thrombocytopenia. Detailed molecular characterization of this effect might provide key knowledge toward better prophylaxis of the hemostatic complications of dengue disease.

TI  - Imd pathway-specific immune assays reveal NF-κB stimulation by viral RNA PAMPs in Aedes aegypti Aag2 cells
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 15
AB  - Background The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a major vector for the arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses. Vector immune responses pose a major barrier to arboviral transmission, and transgenic insects with altered immunity have been proposed as tools for reducing the global public health impact of arboviral diseases. However, a better understanding of virus-immune interactions is needed to progress the development of such transgenic insects. Although the NF-κB-regulated Toll and ‘immunodeficiency’ (Imd) pathways are increasingly thought to be antiviral, relevant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) remain poorly characterised in A. aegypti. Methodology/Principle Findings We developed novel RT-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays to measure induction of the Toll and Imd pathways in the commonly used A. aegypti-derived Aag2 cell line. We thus determined that the Toll pathway is not inducible by exogenous stimulation with bacterial, viral or fungal stimuli in Aag2 cells under our experimental conditions. We used our Imd pathway-specific assays to demonstrate that the viral dsRNA mimic poly(I:C) is sensed by the Imd pathway, likely through intracellular and extracellular PRRs. The Imd pathway was also induced during infection with the model insect-specific virus cricket paralysis virus (CrPV). Conclusions/Significance Our demonstration that a general PAMP shared by many arboviruses is sensed by the Imd pathway paves the way for future studies to determine how viral RNA is sensed by mosquito PRRs at a molecular level. Our data also suggest that studies measuring inducible immune pathway activation through antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression in Aag2 cells should be interpreted cautiously given that the Toll pathway is not responsive under all experimental conditions. With no antiviral therapies and few effective vaccines available to treat arboviral diseases, our findings provide new insights relevant to the development of transgenic mosquitoes as a means of reducing arbovirus transmission. AUTHOR SUMMARY The mosquito Aedes aegypti, found globally across the tropics and subtropics, transmits viral diseases with a significant global public health impact, including chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses. There are no antiviral drugs to treat these diseases and few effective vaccines. One way of reducing the global burden of mosquito-borne diseases would be to develop genetically modified mosquitoes unable to transmit viruses. One approach would be to alter the mosquitoes’ immune system to allow them to better fight viral infections. To do so, we first need to understand how viruses are detected by the mosquito immune system. We developed new methods of measuring immune responses in laboratory-cultured mosquito cells and used them to show that one specific arm of the immune system, called the ‘Imd pathway’, can detect the RNA that constitutes the genome of mosquito-borne viruses. These findings pave the way for future immune studies that could inform the development of transmission-incompetent mosquitoes. We also found that another arm of the immune system, called the ‘Toll pathway’, is not functional under any experimental conditions used in this study. This finding has implications for how different laboratories interpret data from these particular cultured cells.

TI  - Immature Dengue Virus Is Infectious in Human Immature Dendritic Cells via Interaction with the Receptor Molecule DC-SIGN
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - Background Dengue Virus (DENV) is the most common mosquito-borne viral infection worldwide. Important target cells during DENV infection are macrophages, monocytes, and immature dendritic cells (imDCs). DENV-infected cells are known to secrete a large number of partially immature and fully immature particles alongside mature virions. Fully immature DENV particles are considered non-infectious, but antibodies have been shown to rescue their infectious properties. This suggests that immature DENV particles only contribute to the viral load observed in patients with a heterologous DENV re-infection. Methodology/Principal findings In this study, we re-evaluated the infectious properties of fully immature particles in absence and presence of anti-DENV human serum. We show that immature DENV is infectious in cells expressing DC-SIGN. Furthermore, we demonstrate that immature dendritic cells, in contrast to macrophage-like cells, do not support antibody-dependent enhancement of immature DENV. Conclusions/Significance Our data shows that immature DENV can infect imDCs through interaction with DC-SIGN, suggesting that immature and partially immature DENV particles may contribute to dengue pathogenesis during primary infection. Furthermore, since antibodies do not further stimulate DENV infectivity on imDCs we propose that macrophages/monocytes rather than imDCs contribute to the increased viral load observed during severe heterotypic DENV re-infections.

TI  - Immature Dengue Virus: A Veiled Pathogen?
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 6
AB  - Cells infected with dengue virus release a high proportion of immature prM-containing virions. In accordance, substantial levels of prM antibodies are found in sera of infected humans. Furthermore, it has been recently described that the rates of prM antibody responses are significantly higher in patients with secondary infection compared to those with primary infection. This suggests that immature dengue virus may play a role in disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, however, numerous functional studies have revealed that immature particles lack the ability to infect cells. In this report, we show that fully immature dengue particles become highly infectious upon interaction with prM antibodies. We demonstrate that prM antibodies facilitate efficient binding and cell entry of immature particles into Fc-receptor-expressing cells. In addition, enzymatic activity of furin is critical to render the internalized immature virus infectious. Together, these data suggest that during a secondary infection or primary infection of infants born to dengue-immune mothers, immature particles have the potential to be highly infectious and hence may contribute to the development of severe disease.

AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus is a major human pathogen that has four serotypes (DENV1 to -4). Here we report the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of immature and mature DENV1 at 6- and 4.5-Å resolution, respectively. The subnanometer-resolution maps allow accurate placement of all of the surface proteins. Although the immature and mature viruses showed vastly different surface protein organizations, the envelope protein transmembrane (E-TM) regions remain in similar positions. The pivotal role of the E-TM regions leads to the identification of the start and end positions of all surface proteins during maturation.

TI  - Immune Response to Dengue and Zika.
JF  - Annual review of immunology
VL  - 36
SP  - 279
EP  - 308
AB  - Flaviviruses such as dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), and Zika (ZIKV) are human pathogens of global significance. In particular, DENV causes the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral diseases in humans, and ZIKV emerged from obscurity into the spotlight in 2016 as the etiologic agent of congenital Zika syndrome. Owing to the recent emergence of ZIKV as a global pandemic threat, the roles of the immune system during ZIKV infections are as yet unclear. In contrast, decades of DENV research implicate a dual role for the immune system in protection against and pathogenesis of DENV infection. As DENV and ZIKV are closely related, knowledge based on DENV studies has been used to prioritize investigation of ZIKV immunity and pathogenesis, and to accelerate ZIKV diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine design. This review discusses the following topics related to innate and adaptive immune responses to DENV and ZIKV: the interferon system as the key mechanism of host defense and viral target for immune evasion, antibody-mediated protection versus antibody-dependent enhancement, and T cell-mediated protection versus original T cell antigenic sin. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the balance between immune-mediated protection and pathogenesis during DENV and ZIKV infections is critical toward development of safe and effective DENV and ZIKV therapeutics and vaccines.

TI  - Immune and vascular modulation by HERVs: the role of CXCR1 and IL18RAP in dengue severity progression
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 16
AB  - Introduction Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs), which can be activated by viral infections, have complex roles in gene regulation and immune modulation. However, their contribution to disease progression is not yet fully understood. Dengue fever ranges from mild symptoms to severe cases characterized by plasma leakage and immune dysregulation, providing a relevant context to investigate these interactions. Methods This study comes up with a comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed HERVs (DE-HERVs), protein-coding genes (DEGs), and regulatory elements such as microRNAs (DE-miRNA) and non-LTR retroviruses (DE-LINEs and DE-SINEs) derived from the transcriptomes of Brazilian dengue patients across different disease stages. Results The results show that DE-HERVs are associated with key genes identified in severe dengue cases, including ARG1, SLC15A2, COL3A1, SVEP1, CH25H, CST7, CXCR1, IL18RAP, SORL1, and TACR1, suggesting their role in immune modulation and endothelial permeability. Specifically, the upregulation of CXCR1 and IL18RAP genes in patients who progressed to severe dengue correlates with a complex regulatory network involving down-regulated microRNAs (miRNAs) and non-LTR retroviruses, emphasizing their relevance to inflammation and vascular permeability. MicroRNAs and non-LTR retroviruses were found to regulate these genes differently across dengue stages, with non-LTR elements appearing predominantly in non-severe cases and miRNA expression profiles varying across the comparison groups. Discussion These findings improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying dengue progression and suggest that HERV-related regulatory networks may influence viral infections. Further research is required to clarify the specific roles of HERVs in dengue pathogenesis.

TI  - Immune response to arbovirus infection in obesity
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 13
AB  - Obesity is a global health problem that affects 650 million people worldwide and leads to diverse changes in host immunity. Individuals with obesity experience an increase in the size and the number of adipocytes, which function as an endocrine organ and release various adipocytokines such as leptin and adiponectin that exert wide ranging effects on other cells. In individuals with obesity, macrophages account for up to 40% of adipose tissue (AT) cells, three times more than in adipose tissue (10%) of healthy weight individuals and secrete several cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, chemokine C-C ligand (CCL)-2, IL-6, CCL5, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, leading to the development of inflammation. Overall, obesity-derived cytokines strongly affect immune responses and make patients with obesity more prone to severe symptoms than patients with a healthy weight. Several epidemiological studies reported a strong association between obesity and severe arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) infections such as dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Sindbis virus (SINV). Recently, experimental investigations found that DENV, WNV, CHIKV and Mayaro virus (MAYV) infections cause worsened disease outcomes in infected diet induced obese (DIO) mice groups compared to infected healthy-weight animals. The mechanisms leading to higher susceptibility to severe infections in individuals with obesity remain unknown, though a better understanding of the causes will help scientists and clinicians develop host directed therapies to treat severe disease. In this review article, we summarize the effects of obesity on the host immune response in the context of arboviral infections. We have outlined that obesity makes the host more susceptible to infectious agents, likely by disrupting the functions of innate and adaptive immune cells. We have also discussed the immune response of DIO mouse models against some important arboviruses such as CHIKV, MAYV, DENV, and WNV. We can speculate that obesity-induced disruption of innate and adaptive immune cell function in arboviral infections ultimately affects the course of arboviral disease. Therefore, further studies are needed to explore the cellular and molecular aspects of immunity that are compromised in obesity during arboviral infections or vaccination, which will be helpful in developing specific therapeutic/prophylactic interventions to prevent immunopathology and disease progression in individuals with obesity.

TI  - Immune responses and severe dengue: what have we learned?
JF  - Current opinion in infectious diseases
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW
With the marked rise in dengue globally, developing well tolerated and effective vaccines and therapeutics is becoming more important. Here we discuss the recent developments in the understanding of immune mechanisms that lead to severe dengue and the learnings from the past, that can help us to find therapeutic targets, prognostic markers, and vaccines to prevent development of severe disease.


RECENT FINDINGS
The extent and duration of viraemia often appears to be associated with clinical disease severity but with some variability. However, there also appear to be significant differences in the kinetics of viraemia and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigenemia and pathogenicity between different serotypes and genotypes of the DENV. These differences may have significant implications for development of treatments and in inducing robust immunity through dengue vaccines. Although generally higher levels of neutralizing antibodies are thought to protect against infection and severe disease, there have been exceptions and the specificity, breadth and functionality of the antibody responses are likely to be important.


SUMMARY
Although there have been many advances in our understanding of dengue pathogenesis, viral and host factors associated with occurrence of severe dengue, vascular leak and the immune correlates of protection remain poorly understood.

TI  - Immune responses to dengue virus in the skin
JF  - Open Biology
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes infection in humans and current estimates place 40% of the world population at risk for contracting disease. There are four DENV serotypes that induce a febrile illness, which can develop into a severe and life-threatening disease in some cases, characterized primarily by vascular dysregulation. As a mosquito-borne infection, the skin is the initial site of DENV inoculation and also where primary host immune responses are initiated. This review discusses the early immune response to DENV in the skin by both infection target cells such as dendritic cells and by immune sentinels such as mast cells. We provide an overview of the mechanisms of immune sensing and functional immune responses that have been shown to aid clearance of DENV in vivo. Finally, we discuss factors that can influence the immune response to DENV in the skin, such as mosquito saliva, which is co-injected with virus during natural route infection, and pre-existing immunity to other DENV serotypes or to related flaviviruses.

TI  - Immune system gene polymorphisms associated with severe dengue in Latin America: a systematic review
JF  - Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo
VL  - 65
AB  - ABSTRACT One of the main challenges in the clinical management of dengue is the early identification of cases that could progress to severe forms of the disease. A biomarker that may enable this identification is the presence of genetic polymorphisms in genes associated with immune responses. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of the Latin American literature on these genes. An electronic literature search was carried out in PubMed, Scopus, Lilacs, and the Virtual Health Library, and reference lists of systematic reviews in the area. Case-control studies conducted in Latin American countries examining at least one form of genetic polymorphism related to immune responses against severe dengue were included. In total, 424 articles were identified and 26 were included in this systematic review. Of the 26 selected articles, 16 reported polymorphisms associated with the risk of developing severe dengue (Risk); Similarly, 16 articles reported polymorphisms associated with a decreased risk of severe dengue (Protective). The final analysis revealed that multiple polymorphisms in immune system genes were early markers of the progression of dengue in Latin Americans and found that polymorphisms of the TNF-alpha gene may have a critical role in dengue pathogenesis.

TI  - Immune-Mediated Pathogenesis in Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is one of the major public health concerns around the globe, especially in the tropical regions of the world that contribute to 75% percent of dengue cases. While the majority of DENV infections are mild or asymptomatic, approximately 5% of the cases develop a severe form of the disease that is mainly attributed to sequential infection with different DENV serotypes. The severity of dengue depends on many immunopathogenic mechanisms involving both viral and host factors. Emerging evidence implicates an impaired immune response as contributing to disease progression and severity by restricting viral clearance and inducing severe inflammation, subsequently leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Moreover, the ability of DENV to infect a wide variety of immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, and T and B cells, further dysregulates the antiviral functions of these cells, resulting in viral dissemination. Although several risk factors associated with disease progression have been proposed, gaps persist in the understanding of the disease pathogenesis and further investigations are warranted. In this review, we discuss known mechanisms of DENV-mediated immunopathogenesis and its association with disease progression and severity.

TI  - Immune-related transcripts, microbiota and vector competence differ in dengue-2 virus-infected geographically distinct Aedes aegypti populations
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 16
AB  - Background Vector competence in Aedes aegypti is influenced by various factors. Crucial new control methods can be developed by recognizing which factors affect virus and mosquito interactions. Methods In the present study we used three geographically distinct Ae. aegypti populations and compared their susceptibility to infection by dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). To identify any differences among the three mosquito populations, we evaluated expression levels of immune-related genes and assessed the presence of microbiota that might contribute to the uniqueness in their vector competence. Results Based on the results from the DENV-2 competence study, we categorized the three geographically distinct Ae. aegypti populations into a refractory population (Vilas do Atlântico), a susceptible population (Vero) and a susceptible but low transmission population (California). The immune-related transcripts were highly expressed in the California population but not in the refractory population. However, the Rel-1 gene was upregulated in the Vilas do Atlântico population following ingestion of a non-infectious blood meal, suggesting the gene’s involvement in non-viral responses, such as response to microbiota. Screening of the bacteria, fungi and flaviviruses revealed differences between populations, and any of these could be one of the factors that interfere with the vector competence. Conclusions The results reveal potential factors that might impact the virus and mosquito interaction, as well as influence the Ae. aegypti refractory phenotype. Graphical Abstract

TI  - Immuno-proteomic interrogation of dengue infection reveals novel HLA haplotype-specific MHC-I antigens
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Broadly effective vaccines against dengue virus (DENV) infection have remained elusive, despite rising infection rates in the developing world. Infection-specific peptide ligands presented on Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHC) open new avenues for developing T-cell-based interventions. Past efforts towards mapping viral MHC epitopes were based on computational predictions that only partially reflected actual antigen presentation. To empirically identify DENV-specific MHC ligands, we developed an immuno-proteomics approach for interrogating DENV- and self-derived MHC ligands from infected B-lymphocytes. Here, we report four fundamental findings: First, over 700 infection-specific MHC-ligands reflected host cellular responses to DENV that were not apparent from the proteome. Second, we report 121 viral MHC-I ligands (108 novel) which clustered into discrete hotspots across the DENV polyprotein, some of which spanned DENV polyprotein components, described here as MHC ligands for the first time. Third, we found DENV ligands which were distinctly presented by MHC alleles previously associated with either high or low anti-DENV response. Fourth, we demonstrate that while our in vitro assay only overlapped with a small fraction of previously described DENV T-cell epitopes, several novel MHC ligands identified here were recognized by T-cells from DENV-infected patients despite having low binding affinities. Together, these discoveries suggest that virus and host-derived MHC ligands have under-exploited potential for describing the cell biology of DENV infection, and as candidates for designing effective DENV vaccines.

AB  - ELISA and Western blot immunochemical data attest an effective and highly specific interaction of the surface glycoprotein E domain II (DII) of the tick born encephalitis and Dengue viruses with the laminin binding protein (LBP). Based on a highly conservative structure of the DII in different flaviviruses we propose a similarly effective interaction between the LBP and the DII of the surface glycoprotein E of the West Nile virus. We report the results of studies of this interaction by immunochemical and single molecule force spectroscopy methods. The specific binding between these species is confirmed by both methods.

TI  - Immunodominant Dengue Virus-Specific CD8+ T Cell Responses Are Associated with a Memory PD-1+ Phenotype
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 4771
EP  - 4779
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue disease is a large public health problem that mainly afflicts tropical and subtropical regions. Understanding of the correlates of protection against dengue virus (DENV) is poor and hinders the development of a successful human vaccine. The present study aims to define DENV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in general and those of HLA alleles associated with dominant responses in particular. In human blood donors in Nicaragua, we observed a striking dominance of HLA B-restricted responses in general and of the allele B*35:01 in particular. Comparing these patterns to those in the general population of Sri Lanka, we found a strong correlation between restriction of the HLA allele and the breadth and magnitude of CD8+ T cell responses, suggesting that HLA genes profoundly influence the nature of responses. The majority of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) responses were associated with effector memory phenotypes, which were also detected in non-B*35:01-expressing T cells. However, only the B*35:01 DENV-specific T cells were associated with marked expression of the programmed death 1 protein (PD-1). These cells did not coexpress other inhibitory receptors and were able to proliferate in response to DENV-specific stimulation. Thus, the expression of particular HLA class I alleles is a defining characteristic influencing the magnitude and breadth of CD8 responses, and a distinct, highly differentiated phenotype is specifically associated with dominant CD8+ T cells. These results are of relevance for both vaccine design and the identification of robust correlates of protection in natural immunity. IMPORTANCE Dengue is an increasingly significant public health problem as its mosquito vectors spread over greater areas; no vaccines against the virus have yet been approved. An important step toward vaccine development is defining protective immune responses; toward that end, we here characterize the phenotype of the immunodominant T cell responses. These DENV-reactive T cells express high levels of the receptor programmed death 1 protein (PD-1), while those from disease-susceptible alleles do not. Not only does this represent a possible correlate of immunodominance, but it raises the hypothesis that PD-1 might be a regulator that prevents excessive damage while preserving antiviral function. Further, as this study employs distinct populations (Nicaraguan and Sri Lankan donors), we also confirmed that this pattern holds despite geographic and ethnic differences. This finding indicates that HLA type is the major determinant in shaping T cell responses.

AB  - Although many workers have investigated the maturation and processing of the flavivirus nonstructural glycoprotein NS1 in infected cells, these studies have provided little insight into a possible function for NS1. In this study we investigated the subcellular localization of NS1 both by immunofluorescence and cryo-immuno electron microscopy of infected Vero and C6/36 cells. NS1 was found to be tightly associated with intracellular membranes, in particular with vesicle packets and large cytoplasmic vacuoles. Surprisingly, NS1 did not associate with mature virus particles, a finding that is inconsistent with the postulated role for this protein in virion assembly and/or maturation. However, dual-labeling experiments did reveal in both the confocal immunofluorescence and cryo-immuno EM studies the colocalization of NS1 with the viral dsRNA replicative form. Furthermore, localization of the dsRNA to the vesicle packets and cytoplasmic vacuoles seen in infected Vero and C6/36 cells, respectively, suggests that these structures may comprise the flavivirus replication complex. These findings provide further insights into the maturation pathway of NS1 and suggest a possible role for this protein in viral RNA replication.

AB  - In tropical and subtropical regions, dengue fever is a common febrile illness that is mostly spread by Aedes mosquitoes. Urban population migration, inadequate water storage facilities, and high mosquito density are features associated with this disease. The severity of the illness ranges from mild to deadly dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), often with severe cases causing profound shock from extensive plasma leakage, and may result in demise. The symptoms of the illness include headache, myalgia, retro-orbital pain, and hemorrhagic signs. There may also be an intermittent shift in blood vessel integrity and coagulation, but recovery is typically complete and rapid. In this review, we emphasize the immunological aspects of this illness. The intricate interactions among the virus, host genes, and host immune systems impact the pathophysiology of dengue. Postinfection antibody-dependent enhancement is prominent, which significantly influences the etiology and virulence of the disease. Whereas the severe form only manifests when the host immune system is actively working to eradicate the infection by secreting several inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators, for example, early dengue virus infection (DVI) resulted in the production of Interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-6, and later infection, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10. Higher concentrations of interferons gamma (IFN-gamma), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-13 were found in DHF patients. These are significantly more prevalent in severe infections than in mild ones. Numerous immunopathogenic processes involving both virus and host variables influence the severity of dengue. There is growing evidence that a compromised immune system limits viral clearance and causes severe inflammation, which in turn causes dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Furthermore, the capacity of DENV to infect a broad range of immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, T and B cells, and monocytes, further dysregulates these cells’ antiviral activities, leading to the spread of the virus. Even though a number of risk factors linked to the advancement of the disease have been suggested, further research and evaluation of novel technologies are necessary to understand the complicated etiology and develop reliable and effective vaccines to fight against this febrile illness.

TI  - Immunological Cross-Reactivity to Dengue Virus among Persons with Neuroinvasive West Nile Virus Infection
AB  - Antibody dependent enhancement has been well described between Zika and dengue viruses, but is poorly characterized between West Nile and dengue viruses. We demonstrate that neuroinvasive West Nile virus infection leads to the development of non-neutralizing, cross-reactive IgG antibodies to dengue and Zika viruses capable of causing antibody dependent enhancement in vitro of dengue virus and leads to the formation of flavivirus cross-reactive memory B cells in some patients.

AB  - Summary Laboratory studies have provided evidence that the replication of dengue viruses in preparations of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells of human or simian origin, or in macrophage-like cell lines of human or murine origin, may be enhanced by sub-neutralizing concentrations of homotypic dengue antibody, by heterotypic dengue antibody, or by antibody against heterologous flaviviruses. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is discussed in the context of dengue haemorrhagic fever and the dengue shock syndrome.

TI  - Immunological signatures unveiled by integrative systems vaccinology characterization of dengue vaccination trials and natural infection
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 15
AB  - Introduction Dengue virus infection is a global health problem lacking specific therapy, requiring an improved understanding of DENV immunity and vaccine responses. Considering the recent emerging of new dengue vaccines, here we performed an integrative systems vaccinology characterization of molecular signatures triggered by the natural DENV infection (NDI) and attenuated dengue virus infection models (DVTs). Methods and results We analyzed 955 samples of transcriptomic datasets of patients with NDI and attenuated dengue virus infection trials (DVT1, DVT2, and DVT3) using a systems vaccinology approach. Differential expression analysis identified 237 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DVTs and NDI. Among them, 28 and 60 DEGs were up or downregulated by dengue vaccination during DVT2 and DVT3, respectively, with 20 DEGs intersecting across all three DVTs. Enriched biological processes of these genes included type I/II interferon signaling, cytokine regulation, apoptosis, and T-cell differentiation. Principal component analysis based on 20 common DEGs (overlapping between DVTs and our NDI validation dataset) distinguished dengue patients by disease severity, particularly in the late acute phase. Machine learning analysis ranked the ten most critical predictors of disease severity in NDI, crucial for the anti-viral immune response. Conclusion This work provides insights into the NDI and vaccine-induced overlapping immune response and suggests molecular markers (e.g., IFIT5, ISG15, and HERC5) for anti-dengue-specific therapies and effective vaccination development.

TI  - Immunomodulation in dengue: towards deciphering dengue severity markers
JF  - Cell Communication and Signaling : CCS
VL  - 22
AB  - Background Dengue is a vector-borne debilitating disease that is manifested as mild dengue fever, dengue with warning signs, and severe dengue. Dengue infection provokes a collective immune response; in particular, the innate immune response plays a key role in primary infection and adaptive immunity during secondary infection. In this review, we comprehensively walk through the various markers of immune response against dengue pathogenesis and outcome. Main body Innate immune response against dengue involves a collective response through the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factors (TNFs), interferons (IFNs), and interleukins (ILs), in addition to anti-inflammatory cytokines and toll-like receptors (TLRs) in modulating viral pathogenesis. Monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and mast cells are the primary innate immune cells initially infected by DENV. Such immune cells modulate the expression of various markers, which can influence disease severity by aiding virus entry and proinflammatory responses. Adaptive immune response is mainly aided by B and T lymphocytes, which stimulate the formation of germinal centers for plasmablast development and antibody production. Such antibodies are serotype-dependent and can aid in virus entry during secondary infection, mediated through a different serotype, such as in antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), leading to DENV severity. The entire immunological repertoire is exhibited differently depending on the immune status of the individual. Short conclusion Dengue fever through severe dengue proceeds along with the modulated expression of several immune markers. In particular, TLR2, TNF-α, IFN-I, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and IL-10, in addition to intermediate monocytes (CD14+CD16+) and Th17 (CD4+IL-17+) cells are highly expressed during severe dengue. Such markers could assist greatly in severity assessment, prompt diagnosis, and treatment.

AB  - Lymphokines play an important role in immune responses to viruses by modulating functions of T lymphocytes. We examined the effects of interleukin-7 (IL-7) on the growth and cytotoxic activity of dengue virus-specific, CD4+ human cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones. We then compared the effects of IL-7 with those of interleukin-2 (IL-2). The CD4+CTL clones were stimulated with dengue antigen or monoclonal antibody to CD3 in the presence of IL-7 or IL-2. IL-7 induced the growth of CD4+CTL clones and maintained the antigen-specific cytotoxic activity without inducing antigen-non-specific cytotoxic activity. The levels of the growth and cytotoxic activity induced by IL-7 were similar to those induced by IL-2. IL-7 and T-cell growth factor had an additive effect on the growth of CD4+CTL clones. These results suggest that IL-7 may play an important role in CD4+ T cell immune responses to viruses and that IL-7 is a lymphokine useful for maintaining the growth and antigenspecific cytotoxic activity of CD4+CTL clones in vitro, especially when used with T-cell growth factor.

AB  - Dengue virus infection causes dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), whose pathogeneses are not clearly understood. Current hypotheses of antibody-dependent enhancement, virus virulence, and IFN-γ/TNFα-mediated immunopathogenesis are insufficient to explain clinical manifestations of DHF/DSS such as thrombocytopenia and hemoconcentration. Dengue virus infection induces transient immune aberrant activation of CD4/CD8 ratio inversion and cytokine overproduction, and infection of endothelial cells and hepatocytes causes apoptosis and dysfunction of these cells. The coagulation and fibrinolysis systems are also activated after dengue virus infection. We propose a new hypothesis for the immunopathogenesis for dengue virus infection. The aberrant immune responses not only impair the immune response to clear the virus, but also result in overproduction of cytokines that affect monocytes, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes. Platelets are destroyed by crossreactive anti-platelet autoantibodies. Dengue-virus-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy must be involved in the pathogenesis of hemorrhage, and the unbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis activation increases the likelihood of severe hemorrhage in DHF/DSS. Hemostasis is maintained unless the dysregulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis persists. The overproduced IL-6 might play a crucial role in the enhanced production of anti-platelet or anti-endothelial cell autoantibodies, elevated levels of tPA, as well as a deficiency in coagulation. Capillary leakage is triggered by the dengue virus itself or by antibodies to its antigens. This immunopathogenesis of DHF/DSS can account for specific characteristics of clinical, pathologic, and epidemiological observations in dengue virus infection.

AB  - Dengue virus infection is a self-limited condition, which is of particular importance in tropical and subtropical regions and for which no specific treatment or effective vaccine is available. There are several hypotheses explaining dengue pathogenesis. These usually refer to host immune responses, including antibody-dependent enhancement, cytokine expression, and dengue virus particles including NS1 protein, which lead to cell death by both apoptosis and pyroptosis. A clear understanding of the pathogenesis should facilitate the development of vaccines and therapies. This review focuses on the immunopathogenesis in relation to clinical manifestations and patterns of cell death, focusing on the pathogenesis of severe dengue.

AB  - Dengue virus infection causes Dengue Fever (DF), Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) whose pathogeneses were not clearly understood. A new hypothesis of immunopathogenesis is proposed for the development of the DHF/DSS. An aberrant immune over-activation after dengue virus infection not only impair the immune response to clear the virus, but also result in overproduction of cytokines that affect monocytes, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes, as well as the abnormal production of autoantibodies to platelet and endothelial cells. A molecular mimicry occurs between platelets/endothelial cells and dengue virus antigens. Platelets and endothelial cells are bound by the cross-reactive anti-dengue virus antibodies such as anti-NS1 or anti-prM antibodies. The IFN-γ activated macrophage would phagocytosize the osponized targets. Dengue virus-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy are involved in the pathogenesis of hemorrhage, and the unbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis activation increases the likelihood of severe hemorrhage in DHF/DSS. This theory of transient hemophagocytic activity in immunopathogenesis of DHF/DSS can account for specific characteristics of clinical, pathologic, and epidemiological observations in dengue virus infection.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThe continued emergence of dengue virus infection and its severe disease manifestation, dengue hemorrhagic fever, is a growing public health problem. The majority of severe infections occur upon secondary encounters with heterologous dengue virus serotypes, suggesting an immune-mediated process. Recent findingsSignificant findings in the past year include a greater understanding of dengue virus interactions with target cells such as dendritic cells, hepatocytes and endothelial cells. Infection of these cells results in the production of immune mediators that then shape the adaptive humoral and cellular immune response. The circulation of high levels of secreted NS1 in the presence of pre-existing heterologous non-neutralizing antibody may mediate complement activation and trigger plasma leakage. The role of enhancing antibodies in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Recent studies demonstrate low avidity crossreactive T cells, which may produce an altered profile of cytokines leading to plasma leakage. Ongoing prospective studies that include epidemiological, virological and immunological risk factors are crucial to our understanding of the mechanisms of immunopathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever. SummaryThe immune mechanisms that lead to dengue hemorrhagic fever are complex and need to be elucidated further for the development of therapeutics as well as safe and efficacious dengue vaccines.

TI  - Impact of Intrahost NS5 Nucleotide Variations on Dengue Virus Replication
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - Due to the nature of RNA viruses, their high mutation rates produce a population of closely related but genetically diverse viruses, termed quasispecies. To determine the role of quasispecies in DENV disease severity, 22 isolates (10 from mild cases, 12 from fatal cases) were obtained, amplified, and sequenced with Next Generation Sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Using variation calling, unique wildtype nucleotide positions were selected and analyzed for variant nucleotides between mild and fatal cases. The analysis of variant nucleotides between mild and fatal cases showed 6 positions with a significant difference of p < 0.05 with 1 position in the structural region, and 5 positions in the non-structural (NS) regions. All variations were found to have a higher percentage in fatal cases. To further investigate the genetic changes that affect the virus’s properties, reverse genetics (rg) viruses containing substitutions with the variations were generated and viral growth properties were examined. We found that the virus variant rgNS5-T7812G (G81G) had higher replication rates in both Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) and Vero cells while rgNS5-C9420A (A617A) had a higher replication rate only in BHK-21 cells compared to wildtype virus. Both variants were considered temperature sensitive whereby the viral titers of the variants were relatively lower at 39°C, but was higher at 35 and 37°C. Additionally, the variants were thermally stable compared to wildtype at temperatures of 29, 37, and 39°C. In conclusion, viral quasispecies found in isolates from the 2015 DENV epidemic, resulted in variations with significant difference between mild and fatal cases. These variations, NS5-T7812G (G81G) and NS5-C9420A (A617A), affect viral properties which may play a role in the virulence of DENV.

TI  - Impact of bound ssRNA length on allostery in the Dengue Virus NS3 helicase
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 51

EP  - 11224
AB  - Abstract The presence of ATP is known to stimulate helicase activity of the Dengue Virus Non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3h), and the presence of RNA stimulates NS3h ATPase activity, however this coupling is still mechanistically unclear. Here we use atomistic models and molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)-length dependence of the NS3h–ssRNA binding affinity and its modulation by bound ATP. Considering complexes with 7, 11, 16 and 26 nucleotides (nts), we observe that both the binding affinity and its modulation by bound ATP are augmented with increased ssRNA lengths. In models with at least 11 nts bound, the binding of ATP results in a shift from a tightly bound to a weakly bound state. We find that the weakly bound state persists during both the ADP-Pi- and ADP-bound stages of the catalytic cycle. We obtain the equilibrium association constants for NS3h binding to an ssRNA 10-mer in vitro, both in the absence and presence of ADP, which further support the alternation between tightly and weakly bound states during the catalytic cycle. The length of bound ssRNA is critical for understanding the NS3h–RNA interaction as well as how it is modulated during the catalytic cycle.

VL  - 57 2

EP  - 25
AB  - In addition to heavily infecting the salivary glands of Aedes aegypti (L.) mosquitoes, dengue viruses produce a significant infection of the nervous system, involving the brain, Johnston's organ, compound eye, and thoracic and abdominal ganglion. To determine if dengue infection affects feeding behavior of Ae. aegypti we measured feeding times, counted the number of feeding delays or interruptions, and by in situ immunocytochemistry techniques determined the spatial and temporal distribution of dengue infections in females parenterally infected with dengue 3 virus. The mean of the total time required for feeding by infected mosquitoes was significantly longer than the time required by uninfected mosquitoes. Similarly, the mean of the time spent probing was significantly longer in infected mosquitoes than in uninfected mosquitoes when day after inoculation was considered. Significant increases in the length of feeding activity in infected mosquitoes corresponded to virus infection in organs that are known to control or influence activities associated with blood feeding. Sequential infections of the salivary glands (five days postinoculation [PI]), brain and compound eye (eight days PI), and Johnston's organ and midgut and abdominal ganglion (11 days PI) of most mosquitoes were observed. The increased time required by infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes to acquire a blood meal may contribute to the efficiency of Ae. aegypti as a vector of dengue virus. Longer feeding periods are more likely to be interrupted by the host, which increases the chance that an infected mosquito will probe or feed on additional hosts.

VL  - 41 1

EP  - 124
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-transmitted infection endemic in tropical and subtropical locations of the world where nearly half of the world's population resides. The disease may present as mild febrile illness to severe and can even be fatal if untreated. There are four genetically related but antigenically distinct dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. Immune responses to DENV infection are in general protective but under certain conditions, they can also aggravate the disease. The importance of the cellular immune responses and the antibody responses involving IgG and IgM has been well-studied. In contrast, not much has been described on the potential role of hypersensitivity reactions involving IgE in dengue. Several studies have shown elevated levels of IgE in patients with dengue fever, but its involvement in the immune response against the virus and disease is unknown. Activation of mast cells (MCs) and basophils mediated through dengue-specific IgE could result in the release of mediators affecting dengue virus infection. The present review explores the relationships between the induction of IgE in dengue virus infection, and the potential role of MCs and basophils, exploring both protective and pathogenic aspects, including antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection in dengue.

VL  - 162 9

EP  - 15
AB  - Decreased proliferative responses to mitogens and recall Ags have been observed in PBMC obtained during several acute human viral infections. To determine whether cell-mediated responses are altered during acute dengue infection, we examined the proliferative responses of PBMC from children enrolled in a prospective study of dengue infections in Thailand. All responses of PBMC during acute illness were compared with the same patients' PBMC obtained at least 6 mo after their infection. Proliferative responses to PHA, anti-CD3, tetanus toxoid, and dengue Ags were decreased significantly in PBMC obtained during the acute infection. The proliferative responses to PHA were restored by the addition of gamma-irradiated autologous convalescent or allogeneic PBMC. Cell contact with the irradiated PBMC was necessary to restore proliferation. Non-T cells from the acute PBMC of dengue patients did not support proliferation of T cells from control donors in response to PHA, but T cells from the PBMC of patients with acute dengue proliferated if accessory cells from a control donor were present. Addition of anti-CD28 Abs restored anti-CD3-induced proliferation of the PBMC of some patients. The percentage of monocytes was reduced in the acute sample of PBMC of the dengue patients. Addition of IL-2 or IL-7, but not IL-4 or IL-12, also restored proliferation of acute PBMC stimulated with anti-CD3. The results demonstrate that both quantitative and qualitative defects in the accessory cell population during acute dengue illness result in a depression of in vitro T cell proliferation.

TI  - Impairment of CD4+ T cell polarization by dengue virus-infected dendritic cells.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 203 12
SP  - 1763
EP  - 74
AB  - BACKGROUND
The production of type I interferon alpha/beta (IFN-α/β) is crucial to viral clearance during dengue virus (DENV) infection; however, in vitro-infected dendritic cells (DCs) exhibit a decreased capacity to respond to IFN-α/β stimulation, and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) isolated from patients with acute DENV infection exhibit defects in T cell priming.


METHODS
In order to ascertain the stimulatory capacity of primary human monocyte-derived DCs infected with wild-type DENV isolates, representing a range of genotypes and disease outcomes, we cocultured infected DCs with allogeneic-naive CD4(+) T cells. The gene expression patterns of IFN-α/β sensitive genes were quantitated to determine if the infected DCs displayed a blunted IFN-α/β response.


RESULTS
DENV-infected DCs induced the initial proliferation of naive CD4(+) T cells but they remained nonpolarized in effector function. The expression of IFN-α/β-stimulated genes was downregulated, revealing that the inhibition of IFN-α/β signaling is conserved among endemic DENV serotype 2 strains.


CONCLUSIONS
The failure of naive CD4(+) T cells to differentiate into IFN gamma-producing effector T cells when primed by DENV-infected DCs cannot be explained solely by a block in IFN-α/β signaling, suggesting that the ability of DENV to evade the early host response is multifaceted.

TI  - Importin-7-dependent nuclear translocation of the Flavivirus core protein is required for infectious virus production
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 20
AB  - Flaviviridae is a family of positive-stranded RNA viruses, including human pathogens, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and West Nile virus (WNV). Nuclear localization of the viral core protein is conserved among Flaviviridae, and this feature may be targeted for developing broad-ranging anti-flavivirus drugs. However, the mechanism of core protein translocation to the nucleus and the importance of nuclear translocation in the viral life cycle remain unknown. We aimed to identify the molecular mechanism underlying core protein nuclear translocation. We identified importin-7 (IPO7), an importin-β family protein, as a nuclear carrier for Flaviviridae core proteins. Nuclear import assays revealed that core protein was transported into the nucleus via IPO7, whereas IPO7 deletion by CRISPR/Cas9 impaired their nuclear translocation. To understand the importance of core protein nuclear translocation, we evaluated the production of infectious virus or single-round-infectious-particles in wild-type or IPO7-deficient cells; both processes were significantly impaired in IPO7-deficient cells, whereas intracellular infectious virus levels were equivalent in wild-type and IPO7-deficient cells. These results suggest that IPO7-mediated nuclear translocation of core proteins is involved in the release of infectious virus particles of flaviviruses.

TI  - In Acute Dengue Infection, High TIM-3 Expression May Contribute to the Impairment of IFNγ Production by Circulating Vδ2 T Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - γδ T cells are innate cells able to quickly eliminate pathogens or infected/tumoral cells by their antiviral and adjuvancy activities. The role of γδ T cells during Dengue Viral Infection (DENV) infection is not fully elucidated. Nevertheless, human primary γδ T cells have been shown to kill in vitro DENV-infected cells, thus highlighting their possible antiviral function. The aim of this work was to characterize the phenotype and function of Vδ2 T cells in DENV patients. Fifteen DENV patients were enrolled for this study and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were used to analyze Vδ2-T-cell frequency, differentiation profile, activation/exhaustion status, and functionality by multiparametric flow cytometry. Our data demonstrated that DENV infection was able to significantly reduce Vδ2-T-cell frequency and to increase their activation (CD38 and HLA-DR) and exhaustion markers (PD-1 and TIM-3). Furthermore, Vδ2 T cells showed a reduced capability to produce IFN-γ after phosphoantigenic stimulation that can be associated to TIM-3 expression. Several studies are needed to depict the possible clinical impact of γδ-T-cell impairment on disease severity and to define the antiviral and immunoregulatory activities of γδ T cells in the first phases of infection.

TI  - In Vitro Infection with Dengue Virus Induces Changes in the Structure and Function of the Mouse Brain Endothelium
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 11
AB  - Background The neurological manifestations of dengue disease are occurring with greater frequency, and currently, no information is available regarding the reasons for this phenomenon. Some viruses infect and/or alter the function of endothelial organs, which results in changes in cellular function, including permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which allows the entry of infected cells or free viral particles into the nervous system. Methods In the present study, we standardized two in vitro models, a polarized monolayer of mouse brain endothelial cells (MBECs) and an organized co-culture containing MBECs and astrocytes. Using these cell models, we assessed whether DENV-4 or the neuro-adapted dengue virus (D4MB-6) variant infects cells or induces changes in the structure or function of the endothelial barrier. Results The results showed that MBECs, but not astrocytes, were susceptible to infection with both viruses, although the percentage of infected cells was higher when the neuro-adapted virus variant was used. In both culture systems, DENV infection changed the localization of the tight junction proteins Zonula occludens (ZO-1) and Claudin-1 (Cln1), and this process was associated with a decrease in transendothelial resistance, an increase in macromolecule permeability and an increase in the paracellular passing of free virus particles. MBEC infection led to transcriptional up-regulation of adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 and PECAM) and immune mediators (MCP-1 and TNF- α) that are associated with immune cell transmigration, mainly in D4MB-6-infected cells. Conclusion These results indicate that DENV infection in MBECs altered the structure and function of the BBB and activated the endothelium, affecting its transcellular and paracellular permeability and favoring the passage of viruses and the transmigration of immune cells. This phenomenon can be harnessed for neurotropic and neurovirulent strains to infect and induce alterations in the CNS.

TI  - In Vitro RNA Synthesis from Exogenous Dengue Viral RNA Templates Requires Long Range Interactions between 5′- and 3′-Terminal Regions That Influence RNA Structure*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 276
SP  - 15581
EP  - 15591
AB  - Viral replicases of many positive-strand RNA viruses are membrane-bound complexes of cellular and viral proteins that include viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). The in vitro RdRP assay system that utilizes cytoplasmic extracts from dengue viral-infected cells and exogenous RNA templates was developed to understand the mechanism of viral replication in vivo. Our results indicated that in vitro RNA synthesis at the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) required the presence of the 5′-terminal region (TR) and the two cyclization (CYC) motifs suggesting a functional interaction between the TRs. In this study, using a psoralen-UV cross-linking method and an in vitroRdRP assay, we analyzed structural determinants for physical and functional interactions. Exogenous RNA templates that were used in the assays contained deletion mutations in the 5′-TR and substitution mutations in the 3′-stem-loop structure including those that would disrupt the predicted pseudoknot structure. Our results indicate that there is physical interaction between the 5′-TR and 3′-UTR that requires only the CYC motifs. RNA synthesis at the 3′-UTR, however, requires long range interactions involving the 5′-UTR, CYC motifs, and the 3′-stem-loop region that includes the tertiary pseudoknot structure.

TI  - In Vitro Reconstitution Reveals Key Intermediate States of Trimer Formation by the Dengue Virus Membrane Fusion Protein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 5730
EP  - 5740
AB  - ABSTRACT The flavivirus dengue virus (DV) infects cells through a low-pH-triggered membrane fusion reaction mediated by the viral envelope protein E. E is an elongated transmembrane protein with three domains and is organized as a homodimer on the mature virus particle. During fusion, the E protein homodimer dissociates, inserts the hydrophobic fusion loop into target membranes, and refolds into a trimeric hairpin in which domain III (DIII) packs against the central trimer. It is clear that E refolding drives membrane fusion, but the steps in hairpin formation and their pH requirements are unclear. Here, we have used truncated forms of the DV E protein to reconstitute trimerization in vitro. Protein constructs containing domains I and II (DI/II) were monomeric and interacted with membranes to form core trimers. DI/II-membrane interaction and trimerization occurred efficiently at both neutral and low pH. The DI/II core trimer was relatively unstable and could be stabilized by binding exogenous DIII or by the formation of mixed trimers containing DI/II plus E protein with all three domains. The mixed trimer had unoccupied DIII interaction sites that could specifically bind exogenous DIII at either low or neutral pH. Truncated DV E proteins thus reconstitute hairpin formation and define properties of key domain interactions during DV fusion.

TI  - In Vitro and In Vivo Stability of P884T, a Mutation that Relocalizes Dengue Virus 2 Non-structural Protein 5.
JF  - ACS infectious diseases
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is critical for viral RNA synthesis within endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived replication complexes in the cytoplasm; however a proportion of NS5 is known to be localized to the nucleus of infected cells. The importance of nuclear DENV NS5 on viral replication and pathogenesis is still unclear. We recently discovered a nuclear localization signal (NLS) residing in the C-terminal 18 amino acid (Cter18) region of DENV NS5 and that a single NS5 P884T amino acid substitution adjacent to the NLS is sufficient to relocalize a significant proportion of DENV2 NS5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of infected cells. Here, in vitro studies show that the DENV2 NS5 P884T mutant replicates similarly to the parental wild-type infectious clone-derived virus while inducing a greater type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine response, in a manner independent of NS5's ability to degrade STAT2 or regulate SAT1 splicing. In both AG129 mouse and Aedes aegypti mosquito infection models, the P884T virus exhibits lower levels of viral replication only at early timepoints. Intriguingly, there appears to be a tendency for selection pressure to revert to the wild-type proline in P884T-infected Ae. aegypti, in agreement with the high conservation of the proline at this position of NS5 in DENV2, 3, and 4. These results suggest that the predominant nuclear localization of DENV NS5, while not required for viral RNA replication, may play a role in pathogenesis and modulation of the host immune response and contribute to viral fitness in the mosquito host.

TI  - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies Identify Important Features of Dengue Virus pr-E Protein Interactions
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 6
AB  - Flaviviruses bud into the endoplasmic reticulum and are transported through the secretory pathway, where the mildly acidic environment triggers particle rearrangement and allows furin processing of the prM protein to pr and M. The peripheral pr peptide remains bound to virus at low pH and inhibits virus-membrane interaction. Upon exocytosis, the release of pr at neutral pH completes virus maturation to an infectious particle. Together this evidence suggests that pr may shield the flavivirus fusion protein E from the low pH environment of the exocytic pathway. Here we developed an in vitro system to reconstitute the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) pr with soluble truncated E proteins. At low pH recombinant pr bound to both monomeric and dimeric forms of E and blocked their membrane insertion. Exogenous pr interacted with mature infectious DENV and specifically inhibited virus fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of E H244, a highly conserved histidine residue in the pr-E interface, blocked pr-E interaction and reduced release of DENV virus-like particles. Folding, membrane insertion and trimerization of the H244A mutant E protein were preserved, and particle release could be partially rescued by neutralization of the low pH of the secretory pathway. Thus, pr acts to silence flavivirus fusion activity during virus secretion, and this function can be separated from the chaperone activity of prM. The sequence conservation of key residues involved in the flavivirus pr-E interaction suggests that this protein-protein interface may be a useful target for broad-spectrum inhibitors.

AB  - There is growing evidence of the influence of sphingosine kinase (SK) enzymes on viral infection. Here, the role of sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2), an isoform of SK prominent in the brain, was defined during dengue virus (DENV) infection. Chemical inhibition of SK2 activity using two different SK2 inhibitors, ABC294640 and K145, had no effect on DENV infection in human cells in vitro. In contrast, DENV infection was restricted in SK2-/- immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs) with reduced induction of IFN-β mRNA and protein, and mRNA for the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) viperin, IFIT1, IRF7 and CXCL10 in DENV-infected SK2-/- compared to WT iMEFs. Intracranial (ic) DENV injection in C57BL/6 SK2-/- mice induced body weight loss earlier than in WT mice but DENV RNA levels were comparable in the brain. Neither SK1 mRNA or sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels were altered following ic DENV infection in WT or SK2-/- mice but brain S1P levels were reduced in all SK2-/- mice, independent of DENV infection. CD8 mRNA was induced in the brains of both DENV-infected WT and SK2-/- mice, suggesting normal CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the DENV-infected brain independent of SK2 or S1P. Thus, although SK2 may be important for replication of some viruses SK2 activity does not affect DENV infection in vitro and SK2 or S1P levels do not influence DENV infection or T-cell infiltration in the context of infection in the brain.

TI  - In vitro determination of dengue virus type 2 NS2B-NS3 protease activity with fluorescent peptide substrates.
JF  - Journal of biochemistry and molecular biology
VL  - 35 2
SP  - 206
EP  - 12
AB  - The NS2B-NS3(pro) polyprotein segment from the dengue virus serotype 2 strain 16681 was purified from overexpressing E. coli by metal chelate affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Enzymatic activity of the refolded NS2B-NS3(pro) protease complex was determined in vitro with dansyl-labeled peptide substrates, based upon native dengue virus type 2 cleavage sites. The 12mer substrate peptides and the cleavage products could be separated by reversed-phase HPLC, and were identified by UV and fluorescence detection. All of the peptide substrates (representing the DEN polyprotein junction sequences at the NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, NS3/NS4A and NS4B/NS5 sites) were cleaved by the recombinant protease NS2B-NS3(pro). No cleavage was observed with an enzymatically inactive S135A mutant of the NS3 protein, or with a modified substrate peptide of the NS3/NS4A polyprotein site that contained a K2093A substitution. Enzymatic activity was dependent on the salt concentration. A 50% decrease of activity was observed in the presence of 0.1 M sodium chloride. Our results show that the NS3 protease activity of the refolded NS2BNS3(pro) protein can be assayed in vitro with high specificity by using cleavage-junction derived peptide substrates.

TI  - In vitro processing of dengue virus structural proteins: cleavage of the pre-membrane protein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 63
SP  - 3345
EP  - 3352
AB  - Processing of dengue virus structural proteins was assessed in vitro. RNA transcripts for cell-free translation were prepared from cloned DNA (dengue virus type 4, strain 814669 genome) encoding capsid, pre-membrane (prM), and the first 23 amino acids of envelope (E). Processing of a 33-kilodalton precursor polypeptide encoded by wild-type RNA transcripts occurred only in the presence of added microsomal membranes. Under these conditions, cleavage at the capsid-prM and prM-E sites and glycosylation of prM occurred in association with translocation. Amino acid sequence analysis confirmed that translation initiated at the predicted N terminus of the capsid and that capsid-prM cleavage occurred at the predicted site for the action of signal peptidase following a candidate signal sequence (hydrophobic residues 100 to 113) in the dengue virus precursor. Mutations were introduced into the dengue virus DNA template by site-directed mutagenesis, altering nucleotide sequences encoding the capsid and the candidate signal for prM. The phenotypes of the mutants were deduced by analysis of the products of cell-free translation of the respective RNA transcripts. The resulting observations confirmed that cleavage at the capsid-prM and prM-E sites is effected entirely by signal peptidase and that the candidate signal is required for translocation.

TI  - In vitro processing of dengue virus type 2 nonstructural proteins NS2A, NS2B, and NS3
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 64
SP  - 4364
EP  - 4374
AB  - We have tested the hypothesis that the flavivirus nonstructural protein NS3 is a viral proteinase that generates the termini of several nonstructural proteins by using an efficient in vitro expression system and monospecific antisera directed against the nonstructural proteins NS2B and NS3. A series of cDNA constructs was transcribed by using T7 RNA polymerase, and the RNA was translated in reticulocyte lysates. The resulting protein patterns indicated that proteolytic processing occurred in vitro to generate NS2B and NS3. The amino termini of NS2B and NS3 produced in vitro were found to be the same as the termini of NS2B and NS3 isolated from infected cells. Deletion analysis of cDNA constructs localized the protease domain within NS3 to the first 184 amino acids but did not eliminate the possibility that sequences within NS2B were also required for proper cleavage. Kinetic analysis of processing events in vitro and experiments to examine the sensitivity of processing to dilution suggested that an intramolecular cleavage between NS2A and NS2B preceded an intramolecular cleavage between NS2B and NS3. The data from these expression experiments confirm that NS3 is the viral proteinase responsible for cleavage events generating the amino termini of NS2B and NS3 and presumably for cleavages generating the termini of NS4A and NS5 as well.

TI  - In vitro shared transcriptomic responses of Aedes aegypti to arboviral infections: example of dengue and Rift Valley fever viruses
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 13
AB  - Arthropod borne virus infections are the cause of severe emerging diseases. Among the diseases due to arboviruses, dengue (DEN) and Rift Valley fever (RVF) are in the top ten in the list of diseases responsible of severe human cases worldwide. Understanding the effects of viral infection on gene expression in competent vectors is a challenge for the development of early diagnostic tools and may enable researchers and policy makers to better anticipate outbreaks in the next future. In this study, alterations in gene expression across the entire Aedes aegypti genome during infection with DENV and RVFV were investigated in vitro at two time points of infection, the early phase (24 h) and the late phase (6 days) of infection using the RNA sequencing approach A total of 10 upregulated genes that share a similar expression profile during infection with both viruses at early and late phases of infection were identified. Family B and D clip-domain serine proteases (CLIP) were clearly overrepresented as well as C-type lectins and transferrin. Our data highlight the presence of 10 viral genes upregulated in Ae. aegypti during infection. They may also be targeted in the case of the development of broad-spectrum anti-viral diagnostic tools focusing the mosquito vectors rather than the mammalian hosts as they may predict the emergence of outbreaks.

TI  - Increased Plasma Heparanase Activity and Endothelial Glycocalyx Degradation in Dengue Patients Is Associated With Plasma Leakage
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - Background Endothelial hyper-permeability with plasma leakage and thrombocytopenia are predominant features of severe dengue virus infection. It is well established that heparanase, the endothelial glycocalyx degrading enzyme, plays a major role in various diseases with vascular leakage. It is yet to be elucidated whether heparanase activity plays a major role in dengue-associated plasma leakage. Moreover, the major source of heparanase secretion and activation in dengue remains elusive. Since a relatively high amount of heparanase is stored in platelets, we postulate that heparanase released by activated platelets contributes to the increased plasma heparanase activity during dengue virus infection. Methods Heparanase activity (plasma and urine), and heparan sulfate and syndecan-1 (plasma levels) were measured in dengue patients with thrombocytopenia in acute phase (n=30), during course of disease (n=10) and in convalescent phase (n=25). Associations with clinical parameters and plasma leakage markers were explored. Platelets from healthy donors were stimulated with dengue non-structural protein-1, DENV2 virus and thrombin to evaluate heparanase release and activity ex vivo. Results Heparanase activity was elevated in acute dengue and normalized during convalescence. Similarly, glycocalyx components, such as heparan sulfate and syndecan-1, were increased in acute dengue and restored during convalescence. Increased heparanase activity correlated with the endothelial dysfunction markers heparan sulfate and syndecan-1, as well as clinical markers of plasma leakage such as ascites, hematocrit concentration and gall-bladder wall thickening. Notably, platelet number inversely correlated with heparanase activity. Ex vivo incubation of platelets with thrombin and live DENV2 virus, but not dengue virus-2-derived non-structural protein 1 induced heparanase release from platelets. Conclusion Taken together, our findings suggest that the increase of heparanase activity in dengue patients is associated with endothelial glycocalyx degradation and plasma leakage. Furthermore, thrombin or DENV2 activated platelets may be considered as a potential source of heparanase.

TI  - Increased Production of Interleukin-4, Interleukin-10, and Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor by Type 2 Diabetes' Mononuclear Cells Infected with Dengue Virus, but Not Increased Intracellular Viral Multiplication
JF  - BioMed Research International
VL  - 2013
AB  - It has been reported that diabetes mellitus (DM) was an epidemiologically identified risk factor for development of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/severe dengue in dengue virus (DENV) affected patients, and T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 each plays an important role in the immunopathogenesis of DHF in studies involving general population. To better understand the relationship between these epidemiological and immunological findings, we performed an in vitro study evaluating the sequential immunological reactions and viral load in the DENV infected mononuclear cells of adults with type 2 DM (T2DM group, n = 33) and normal adults (control group, n = 29). We found in the T2DM group significantly higher IL-4 level on the first (P = 0.049) and the third (P = 0.022) postinfection days, while higher IL-10 (P = 0.042) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (P = 0.009) were detected on the third postinfection day. No significant difference in DENV viral load between the cultured mononuclear cells from both groups was found on the first and third post-infection days. These data immunologically suggest that patients with T2DM are at higher risk for development of DHF/severe dengue and strengthen the previously epidemiologically identified role of DM being a predictive risk factor for progressing into DHF/severe dengue in DENV-affected patients.

TI  - Increased Production of Interleukin-8 in Primary Human Monocytes and in Human Epithelial and Endothelial Cell Lines after Dengue Virus Challenge
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 76
SP  - 5588
EP  - 5597
AB  - ABSTRACT The more severe form of dengue virus infection, dengue hemorrhagic fever, is characterized by plasma leakage and derangements in hemostasis. As elevated interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels have been observed in sera from patients with more severe disease manifestations, a study was initiated to look at the effect of dengue virus infection in vitro on proinflammatory cytokine secretion and expression. A significant increase in IL-8 levels in the culture supernatant of primary human monocytes infected with dengue 2 virus (D2V) New Guinea C (NGC) was found by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, by reverse transcriptase PCR, the mRNA was also augmented. Among the proinflammatory cytokines and their mRNAs measured (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha), IL-8 showed the greatest change following D2V infection. Similarly, two cell lines, 293T (a human epithelial cell line) and ECV304 (an endothelial cell line), were permissive to D2V NGC and responded to the infection by increasing the synthesis of IL-8. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor IL-6 (NFIL-6) are primary mediators of IL-8 expression. We studied the transcriptional regulation of IL-8 in the ECV304 and 293T cell lines and found that the induction of IL-8 gene expression involved the activation of NF-κB (P = 0.001) and, to a lesser extent, the activation of NFIL-6 in ECV304 cells only. We next observed by the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure in vivo acetylation of core histones bound to the IL-8 promoter after D2V infection. IL-8 produced by infected monocytes and also IL-8 that may be produced by endothelial or other epithelial cells is associated with the hyperacetylation of histones bound to the IL-8 promoter in addition to the activation of transcription by NF-κB. We hypothesize that the overall increase in IL-8 synthesis observed in this in vitro study may play a role in the pathogenesis of the plasma leakage seen in dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.

TI  - Increased capsid oligomerization is deleterious to dengue virus particle production.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 102 8
AB  - The capsid protein (C) of dengue virus is required for viral infectivity as it packages viral RNA genome into infectious particles. C exists as a homodimer that forms via hydrophobic interactions between the α2 and α4 helices of monomers. To identify C region(s) important for virus particle production, a complementation system was employed in which single-round infectious particles are generated by trans-encapsidation of a viral C-deleted genome by recombinant C expressed in mosquito cells. Mutants harbouring a complete α3 deletion, or a dual Ile65-/Trp69-to-Ala substitution in the α3 helix, exhibited reduced production of infectious virus. Unexpectedly, higher proportions of oligomeric C were detected in cells expressing both mutated forms as compared with the wild-type counterpart, indicating that the α3 helix, through its internal hydrophobic residues, may down-modulate oligomerization of C during particle formation. Compared with wild-type C, the double Ile65-/Trp69 to Ala mutations appeared to hamper viral infectivity but not C and genomic RNA incorporation into the pseudo-infectious virus particles, suggesting that increased C oligomerization may impair DENV replication at the cell entry step.

TI  - Individual co-variation between viral RNA load and gene expression reveals novel host factors during early dengue virus infection of the Aedes aegypti midgut
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes more human infections than any other mosquito-borne virus. The current lack of antiviral strategies has prompted genome-wide screens for host genes that are required for DENV infectivity. Earlier transcriptomic studies that identified DENV host factors in the primary vector Aedes aegypti used inbred laboratory colonies and/or pools of mosquitoes that erase individual variation. Here, we performed transcriptome sequencing on individual midguts in a field-derived Ae. aegypti population to identify new candidate host factors modulating DENV replication. We analyzed the transcriptomic data using an approach that accounts for individual co-variation between viral RNA load and gene expression. This approach generates a prediction about the agonist or antagonist effect of candidate genes on DENV replication based on the sign of the correlation between gene expression and viral RNA load. Using this method, we identified 39 candidate genes that went undetected by conventional pairwise comparison of gene expression levels between DENV-infected midguts and uninfected controls. Only four candidate genes were detected by both methods, emphasizing their complementarity. We demonstrated the value of our approach by functional validation of a candidate agonist gene encoding a sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), which was identified by correlation analysis but not by pairwise comparison. We confirmed that SREBP promotes DENV infection in the midgut by RNAi-mediated gene knockdown in vivo. We suggest that our approach for transcriptomic analysis can empower genome-wide screens for potential agonist or antagonist factors by leveraging inter-individual variation in gene expression. More generally, this method is applicable to a wide range of phenotypic traits displaying inter-individual variation.

JF  - BMC Infectious Diseases

AB  - Mononuclear phagocytes are considered to be main targets for Dengue Virus (DENV) replication. These cells are activated after infection, producing proinflammatory mediators, including tumour-necrosis factor-α, which has also been detected in vivo. Nitric oxide (NO), usually produced by activated mononuclear phagocytes, has antimicrobial and antiviral activities.MethodsThe expression of DENV antigens and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in human blood isolated monocytes were analysed by flow cytometry using cells either from patients with acute Dengue Fever or after DENV-1 in vitro infection. DENV-1 susceptibility to iNOS inhibition and NO production was investigated using NG-methyl L-Arginine (NGMLA) as an iNOS inhibitor, which was added to DENV-1 infected human monocytes, and sodium nitroprussiate (SNP), a NO donor, added to infected C6/36 mosquito cell clone. Viral antigens after treatments were detected by flow cytometry analysis.ResultsINOS expression in activated monocytes was observed in 10 out of 21 patients with Dengue Fever and was absent in cells from ten healthy individuals. DENV antigens detected in 25 out of 35 patients, were observed early during in vitro infection (3 days), significantly diminished with time, indicating that virus replicated, however monocytes controlled the infection. On the other hand, the iNOS expression was detected at increasing frequency in in vitro infected monocytes from three to six days, exhibiting an inverse relationship to DENV antigen expression. We demonstrated that the detection of the DENV-1 antigen was enhanced during monocyte treatment with NGMLA. In the mosquito cell line C6/36, virus detection was significantly reduced in the presence of SNP, when compared to that of untreated cells.ConclusionThis study is the first to reveal the activation of DENV infected monocytes based on induction of iNOS both in vivo and in vitro, as well as the susceptibility of DENV-1 to a NO production.

TI  - Induction of PD-1 and CD44 in CD4+ T cells by circulatory extracellular vesicles from severe dengue patients drives endothelial damage via the NF-kB signaling pathway
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 99
AB  - ABSTRACT Extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerged as critical contributors to the pathogenesis of vascular endothelial barrier dysfunction during the inflammatory response to infection. However, the contribution of circulating EVs to modifying endothelial function during dengue virus infection remains unclear. In this study, we showed that severe dengue patients’ plasma-derived EV (SD-EV) were found to carry elevated levels of different protein cargos, e.g., immunoregulatory proteins (PD-L1, CD44). Further, we demonstrated that SD-EV induces PD-1 and CD44 expression on CD4+ T cells. SD-EV-modulated CD4+ T (SD-EV-CD4) cells released secretome delayed endothelial cell (EC) migration, arrested them in the G1 phase, and augmented the expression of PD-L1 and ICAM-1 expression on EC through the Notch signaling pathway. Blocking SD-EV and CD4+ T-cell interaction through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway partially rescued the CD4+ T cell’s effect on EC but did not alter ICAM-1 expression on EC. We observed that the ICAM-1 expression on EC and hyaluronic acid (HA) release from EC was mediated by CD44, which was elevated on SD-EV-modulated CD4+ T cells (SD-EV-CD4), indicating a permeability defect. Blocking of CD44 on SD-EV-CD4 significantly reduced ICAM-1 expression on EC. Further, depletion of specific cytokines, e.g., TNF-α and not IFN-γ from the SD-EV-CD4 secretome, reduced ICAM-1 expression, decreased transendothelial electrical resistance, and induced apoptosis on EC significantly. Treatment with NF-kB inhibitor before secretome addition to EC reduced ICAM-1 expression on EC. In conclusion, we provided evidence that SD-EV-CD4 carrying PD-1 and CD44, when interacting with EC, significantly affected endothelial cell properties and may be significant in dengue-mediated endothelial dysfunction. IMPORTANCE Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small membrane vesicles secreted into biological fluids, including plasma from living cells, holding insights into pathological processes. Studying EVs under pathological conditions is extremely important as they play a selective role in intercellular communication and modulation of immune response under diverse pathological conditions. However, there is less clarity on how circulatory extracellular vesicles influence immune cells during dengue virus (DV) infection and impact pathogenesis. Our present study highlights the impact of severe dengue patients’ plasma-derived EV (SD-EV) on CD4+ T cells and together induce endothelial barrier dysfunction. We provided evidence that SD-EV induces PD-1 and CD44 on CD4+ T cells and, when interacting with endothelial cells (EC), drives endothelial damage through direct interaction or secretome and may be significant in dengue-mediated endothelial dysfunction.

TI  - Induction of a Peptide with Activity against a Broad Spectrum of Pathogens in the Aedes aegypti Salivary Gland, following Infection with Dengue Virus
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 7
AB  - The ultimate stage of the transmission of Dengue Virus (DENV) to man is strongly dependent on crosstalk between the virus and the immune system of its vector Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti). Infection of the mosquito's salivary glands by DENV is the final step prior to viral transmission. Therefore, in the present study, we have determined the modulatory effects of DENV infection on the immune response in this organ by carrying out a functional genomic analysis of uninfected salivary glands and salivary glands of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes infected with DENV. We have shown that DENV infection of salivary glands strongly up-regulates the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in the vector's innate immune response, including the immune deficiency (IMD) and Toll signalling pathways, and that it induces the expression of the gene encoding a putative anti-bacterial, cecropin-like, peptide (AAEL000598). Both the chemically synthesized non-cleaved, signal peptide-containing gene product of AAEL000598, and the cleaved, mature form, were found to exert, in addition to antibacterial activity, anti-DENV and anti-Chikungunya viral activity. However, in contrast to the mature form, the immature cecropin peptide was far more effective against Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and, furthermore, had strong anti-parasite activity as shown by its ability to kill Leishmania spp. Results from circular dichroism analysis showed that the immature form more readily adopts a helical conformation which would help it to cause membrane permeabilization, thus permitting its transfer across hydrophobic cell surfaces, which may explain the difference in the anti-pathogenic activity between the two forms. The present study underscores not only the importance of DENV-induced cecropin in the innate immune response of Ae. aegypti, but also emphasizes the broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic activity of the immature, signal peptide-containing form of this peptide.

TI  - Induction of defensin response to dengue infection in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Entomological Science
VL  - 18
AB  - Innate immune‐related defensin peptide expression, the major antimicrobial peptide (AMP) in the dengue vector mosquito Aedes aegypti, was analyzed following infection by dengue virus type 2 (strain 16681) (DENV‐2). In vitro, the mosquito cell line C6/36 was exposed to dengue virus at different multiplicities of infection (MOI) in an hour; it was found that the expression level of defensin transcripts was dependent upon viral dose. In addition, using both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting assays to determine defensin transcription and translation at a series of times post‐inoculation, we found that the time course of defensin transcripts correlated with the expression of defensin peptide post‐infection. In vitro, female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were fed different meals (DENV‐2 infected blood, non‐infectious blood and sugar) at 14 days post‐feeding, to determine defensin transcription in response to dengue infection, by surface‐enhanced laser desorption/ionization time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (SELDI‐TOF‐MS) assay. The results showed that a peak of 4.25 kDa peptide, composed of defensin, was predominantly induced by DENV‐2 infected blood‐fed mosquitoes. We observed that DENV‐2 could trigger the defensin peptide, defined molecularly as an innate immune response. Therefore, this peptide may be involved in dengue infection and/or transmission. Improved understanding of the mosquito's responses to dengue virus should strengthen our understanding of this vector's innate immune system.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 67 ( Pt 8)
SP  - 1653
EP  - 61
AB  - Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of non-immune donors produced interferon (IFN) when cultured with dengue virus-infected cells. IFN was detected as early as 2 h after exposure of PBL to dengue virus-infected cells, and the titres reached a maximum by 16 h of incubation. Dengue virus-infected cells treated with glutaraldehyde, which produced no infectious dengue virus, also induced IFN. These results indicate that PBL produce IFN in response to dengue virus-infected cells and that the production of IFN by PBL is due to stimulation of PBL by dengue virus-infected cells. Characterization of IFN-producing PBL with monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that the predominant producing cells were contained in M1+ and T3- subsets, and that the Leu11+ subset contains some IFN-producing cells. The IFNs that were produced by the PBL exposed to dengue virus-infected cells were analysed by radioimmunoassay employing monoclonal antibodies specifically to detect IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma as well as IFN-alpha was produced by PBL exposed to dengue virus-infected cells. Both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma were predominantly produced by PBL contained in M1+ and T3- subsets. The observation that PBL of non-immune donors produced IFN-gamma as well as IFN-alpha in response to dengue virus-infected cells is of interest in view of the immunoregulatory roles of IFNs and the hypothesis that the complications of dengue virus infection (haemorrhagic fever and shock) may be due to immunopathology.

AB  - Human monocytes actively replicate dengue virus. To dissect the primary immune responses to dengue virus-infected monocytes (DV-monocytes), we analyzed the interaction between autologous DV-monocytes and the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of dengue nonimmune donors. Interferon (IFN) activity was detected when PBL were cultured with DV- monocytes. Cell contact between PBL and DV-monocytes was required for IFN production; however, MHC compatibility between PBL and monocytes was not necessary. DV-monocytes fixed with paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde, which produced no infectious virus, also induced high levels of IFN from PBL. The ability of DV-monocytes to induce IFN correlated with the appearance of dengue antigens. The PBL that produce IFN were characterized by FACS sorting using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. HLA-DR+ and T3- cells produced high titers of IFN, while HLA-DR- and T3+ cells produced very low or undetectable levels of IFN. Moderate titers of IFN were produced by cells contained in B cell fractions (surface immunoglobulin-positive, B1+, and Leu-12+), and cells contained in natural killer cell fractions (Leu-11+ and OKM1+). Therefore, IFN-producing cells are heterogeneous, and the predominant producer cells are characterized as HLA-DR+ and non-T lymphocytes. The IFN produced was characterized by RIA using mAbs to IFN-alpha and IFN- gamma. The IFN-alpha was the predominant IFN produced; in addition, a low level of IFN-gamma was also detected in some experiments. The culture fluids obtained from PBL exposed to autologous DV-monocytes, which contained high IFN activity, completely inhibited dengue virus infection of monocytes. These results suggest that IFN-alpha produced by PBL exposed to DV-monocytes may play an important role in controlling primary dengue virus infection.

TI  - Infection of Aedes albopictus Mosquito C6/36 Cells with the wMelpop Strain of Wolbachia Modulates Dengue Virus-Induced Host Cellular Transcripts and Induces Critical Sequence Alterations in the Dengue Viral Genome
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases are of global significance causing considerable morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Dengue virus (DENV; serotypes 1 to 4), a member of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, causes millions of infections annually. Development of a safe vaccine is hampered due to absence of cross-protection and increased risk in secondary infections due to antibody-mediated immune enhancement. Infection of vector mosquitoes with Wolbachia bacteria offers a novel countermeasure to suppress DENV transmission, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, the host transcription profiles and viral RNA sequences were analyzed in naive A. albopictus (C6/36) and wMelPop-C6/36 cells by RNAseq. Our results showed that the wMelPop symbiont caused profound changes in host transcription profiles and morphology of DENV2-infected C6/36 cells. Accumulation of several mutations throughout DENV2 RNA resulted in loss of infectivity of progeny virions. Our findings offer new insights into the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated suppression of DENV transmission. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) causes frequent epidemics infecting ∼390 million people annually in over 100 countries. There are no approved vaccines or antiviral drugs for treatment of infected patients. However, there is a novel approach to control DENV transmission by the mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, using the Wolbachia symbiont. The wMelPop strain of Wolbachia suppresses DENV transmission and shortens the mosquito life span. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. To clarify this mechanism, either naive A. albopictus (C6/36) or wMelPop-C6/36 cells were infected with DENV serotype 2 (DENV2). Analysis of host transcript profiles by transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) revealed that the presence of wMelPop dramatically altered the mosquito host cell transcription in response to DENV2 infection. The viral RNA evolved from wMelPop-C6/36 cells contained low-frequency mutations (∼25%) within the coding region of transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1) of E protein. Mutations with >97% frequencies were distributed within other regions of E, the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5POL) domain, and the TMDs of NS2A, NS2B, and NS4B. Moreover, while DENV2-infected naive C6/36 cells showed syncytium formation, DENV2-infected wMelPop-C6/36 cells did not. The Wolbachia-induced mutant DENV2 can readily infect and replicate in naive C6/36 cells, whereas in mutant DENV2-infected BHK-21 or Vero cells, virus replication was delayed. In LLC-MK2 cells, the mutant failed to produce plaques. Additionally, in BHK-21 cells, many mutations in the viral genome reverted to the wild type (WT) and compensatory mutations in NS3 gene appeared. Our results indicate that wMelPop impacts significantly the interactions of DENV2 with mosquito and mammalian host cells. IMPORTANCE Mosquito-borne diseases are of global significance causing considerable morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Dengue virus (DENV; serotypes 1 to 4), a member of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, causes millions of infections annually.

TI  - Infection of Endothelial Cells by Dengue Virus Induces ROS Production by Different Sources Affecting Virus Replication, Cellular Activation, Death and Vascular Permeability
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 13
AB  - Exacerbated inflammatory response and altered vascular function are hallmarks of dengue disease. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production has been associated to endothelial barrier disturbance and microvascular alteration in distinct pathological conditions. Increased ROS has been reported in in vitro models of dengue virus (DENV) infection, but its impact for endothelial cell physiology had not been fully investigated. Our group had previously demonstrated that infection of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) with DENV results in the activation of RNA sensors and production of proinflammatory cytokines, which culminate in cell death and endothelial permeability. Here, we evaluated the role of mitochondrial function and NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation for ROS generation in HBMEC infected by DENV and investigated whether altered cellular physiology could be a consequence of virus-induced oxidative stress. DENV-infected HBMECs showed a decrease in the maximal respiratory capacity and altered membrane potential, indicating functional mitochondrial alteration, what might be related to mtROS production. Indeed, mtROS was detected at later time points after infection. Specific inhibition of mtROS diminished virus replication, cell death, and endothelial permeability, but did not affect cytokine production. On the other hand, inhibition of NOX-associated ROS production decreased virus replication and cell death, as well as the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and CCL5. These results demonstrated that DENV replication in endothelial cells induces ROS production by different pathways, which impacts biological functions that might be relevant for dengue pathogenesis. Those data also indicate oxidative stress events as relevant therapeutical targets to avoid vascular permeability, inflammation, and neuroinvasion during DENV infection.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 74

EP  - 7823
AB  - ABSTRACT Although prior studies have investigated cellular infection by dengue virus (DV), many have used highly passaged strains. We have reassessed cellular infection by DV type 2 (DV2) using prototype and low-passage isolates representing genotypes from different geographic areas. We observed marked variation in the susceptibility to infection among cell types by different DV2 strains. HepG2 hepatoma cells were susceptible to infection by all DV2 strains assayed. Although the prototype strain generated higher titers of secreted virus than the low-passage isolates, this difference did not correspond to positive- or negative-strand viral RNA levels and thus may reflect variation in efficiency among DV2 isolates to translate viral proteins or package and/or secrete virus. In contrast, human foreskin fibroblasts were susceptible to the prototype and low-passage Thai isolates but not to five Nicaraguan strains tested, as reflected by the absence of accumulation of negative-strand viral RNA, viral antigen, and infectious virus. A similar pattern was observed with the antibody-dependent pathway of infection. U937 and THP-1 myeloid cells and peripheral blood monocytes were infected in the presence of enhancing antibodies by the prototype strain but not by low-passage Nicaraguan isolates. Again, the barrier appeared to be prior to negative-strand accumulation. Thus, depending on the cell type and viral isolate, blocks that limit the production of infectious virus in vitro may occur at distinct steps in the pathway of cellular infection.

SP  - 423
EP  - 437
AB  - Dengue viruses (DV) infection is an important public health issue all over the world. Although the pathogenesis remains unclear, the overwhelmingly triggered immune responses have been consistently observed. Recently, we and other researchers demonstrated that the natural hosts for DV are dendritic cells (DC), the primary sentinels of immune system. In light of the significance of T cells in dengue virus pathogenesis, here, we examine the possible consequences of DC‐T cell interaction that is supposed to be happening in lymphoid tissues after infection. We showed that DV‐infected DC induced the interacting T cells to proliferate, to produce interleukin‐2 as well as to express activation markers on cell surface. Compared to mock‐infected DC, the infection of DC by DV also induced T cells to produce interleukin‐4, interleukin‐10 and interferon‐gamma, a cytokine pattern suggesting Th0 phenotype. Such an effect was either totally abolished or greatly reduced when DV were pre‐inactivated with heat or ultraviolet before infection. In addition, we demonstrated that such a Th0 phenotype shift of T cells was affected neither by different dosages of viruses that infected DC nor by different durations of DC‐T cell interaction. Our results provide a basic support for clinical observations and may be of help in understanding the pathogenesis of DV infection.

AB  - Dengue virus (DV) infection is a major problem in public health. It can cause fatal diseases such as Dengue hemorrhagic fever and Dengue shock syndrome. Dendritic cells (DC) are professional APCs required for establishing a primary immune response. Here, we investigated the role of human PBMC-derived DC in DV infection. Using different techniques, including plaque assay, flow cytometry analysis, nested RT-PCR, and confocal microscope and electron microscope examinations, we show that DV can enter cultured human DC and produce virus particles. After entrance, DV could be visualized in cystic vesicles, vacuoles, and the endoplasmic reticulum. The DV-infected DC also showed proliferation and hypertrophy of the endoplasmic reticulum as well as the swollen mitochondria. In addition, the DV-stimulated DC could express maturation markers such as B7-1, B7-2, HLA-DR, CD11b, and CD83. Furthermore, the infection of DC by DV induced production of TNF-α and IFN-α, but not IL-6 and IL-12. Although DC underwent spontaneous apoptosis in the absence of feeding cytokines, this process appeared to be delayed after DV infection. Our observations provide important information in understanding the pathogenesis of DV infection.

TI  - Infection of epithelial cells with dengue virus promotes the expression of proteins favoring the replication of certain viral strains
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 86
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue and severe dengue. To understand better the dengue virus‐host interaction, it is important to determine how the expression of cellular proteins is modified due to infection. Therefore, a comparison of protein expression was conducted in Vero cells infected with two different DENV strains, both serotype 2: DENV‐2/NG (associated with dengue) and DENV‐2/16681 (associated with severe dengue). The viability of the infected cells was determined, and neither strain induced cell death at 48 hr. In addition, the viral genomes and infectious viral particles were quantified, and the genome of the DENV‐2/16681 strain was determined to have a higher replication rate compared with the DENV‐2/NG strain. Finally, the proteins from infected and uninfected cultures were separated using two‐dimensional gel electrophoresis, and the differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Compared with the uninfected controls, the DENV‐2/NG‐ and DENV‐2/16681‐infected cultures had five and six differentially expressed proteins, respectively. The most important results were observed when the infected cultures were compared to each other (DENV‐2/NG vs. DENV‐2/16681), and 18 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Based on their cellular functions, many of these proteins were linked to the increase in the replication efficiency of DENV. Among the proteins were calreticulin, acetyl coenzyme A, acetyl transferase, and fatty acid‐binding protein. It was concluded that the infection of Vero cells with DENV‐2/NG or DENV‐2/16681 differentially modifies the expression of certain proteins, which can, in turn, facilitate infection. J. Med.

TI  - Infection of five human liver cell lines by dengue‐2 virus
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 60
AB  - Elevated serum transaminase levels of dengue patients indicate the possible impact of dengue virus infection on liver function. To elucidate the action of dengue virus infection in liver cells, an in vitro cell line system was established that mimicked the liver status of diverse clinical patients. Briefly, four hepatoma cell lines (HA22T, Huh7, Hep3B, and PLC) and one nonmalignant hepatocyte cell line (Chang liver) were included, representing various levels of tumorigenicity and differentiation. Our data showed that in these five cell lines, dengue‐2 virus attached to each cell type equally well; however, this virus had higher replication rates and levels of virion production in differentiated Huh7, PLC, Hep3B, and Chang liver cells. Likewise, a lower replication rate was observed in the de‐differentiated HA22T cells. Differentiation‐related factors seem to play an important role in dengue virus replication. Further study showed that sodium butyrate (NaB, a differentiation inducer) treatment enhanced dengue virus replication in HA22T cells. Moreover, we found that the severity of morphologic aberration and the increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels correlated with the virus replication rate in the four infected hepatoma cells. In conclusion, we showed that dengue virus can infect diverse liver cells with differing replication efficiency, which causes cytopathic effects (CPEs) of diverse severity. Among the CPEs, the increased AST levels correlated with the clinical results from 24 dengue fever patients, who showed increased AST levels at the onset of fever. In summary, we find that dengue‐2 virus replicates actively and causes severe CPEs in differentiated hepatoma cells. Factors related to differentiation as well as tumorigenicity seem to play critical roles, though the mechanisms of action remain unclear. J. Med. Virol. 60:425–431, 2000. © 2000 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

TI  - Infection of human primary hepatocytes with dengue virus serotype 2
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 79
AB  - While the impact of the dengue viruses on liver function is prominent as shown by hepatomegaly, liver enzyme abnormality, occasional fulminant hepatic failure and histological changes including hepatocellular necrosis, significant debate exists as to the possible involvement of the predominant cell type in the liver, hepatocytes, in the disease process. To address this issue purified human primary hepatocytes were exposed to dengue virus serotype 2 and the production of de novo viral progeny was established by standard plaque assay, RT‐PCR and immunocytochemistry. To investigate the response of the primary hepatocytes to infection, the expression of a panel of 9 cytokine genes (IFN‐β, TRAIL, MCP‐1, IL‐6, IL‐1β, IL‐8, MIP‐1α, MIP‐1β, and RANTES) was semi‐quantitatively investigated by RT‐PCR and up‐regulation of TRAIL, MIP‐1α, IFN‐β, MIP‐1β, IL‐8, and RANTES was observed in response to infection. The induction of IL‐8 in response to infection was accompanied by the secretion of IL‐8 as verified by ELISA assay. The ability of hepatocytes to be infected with dengue virus serotype 2 in vitro support evidence implicating human hepatocytes as a target cell in cases of dengue virus infection, and provide the first experimental evidence to support the large number of clinical studies that implicate the liver as a critical target organ in severe cases of dengue infection.

TI  - Infection with dengue-2 virus alters proteins in naturally expectorated saliva of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 7
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is responsible for up to approximately 300 million infections and an increasing number of deaths related to severe manifestations each year in affected countries throughout the tropics. It is critical to understand the drivers of this emergence, including the role of vector-virus interactions. When a DENV-infected Aedes aegypti mosquito bites a vertebrate, the virus is deposited along with a complex mixture of salivary proteins. However, the influence of a DENV infection upon the expectorated salivary proteome of its vector has yet to be determined. Therefore, we conducted a proteomic analysis using 2-D gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry based protein identification comparing the naturally expectorated saliva of Aedes aegypti infected with DENV-2 relative to that of uninfected Aedes aegypti. Several proteins were found to be differentially expressed in the saliva of DENV-2 infected mosquitoes, in particular proteins with anti-hemostatic and pain inhibitory functions were significantly reduced. Hypothetical consequences of these particular protein reductions include increased biting rates and transmission success, and lead to alteration of transmission potential as calculated in our vectorial capacity model. We present our characterizations of these changes with regards to viral transmission and mosquito blood-feeding success. Further, we conclude that our proteomic analysis of Aedes aegypti saliva altered by DENV infection provides a unique opportunity to identify pro-viral impacts key to virus transmission.

TI  - Infection with flaviviruses requires BCLXL for cell survival
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - BCL2 family proteins including pro-survival proteins, BH3-only proteins and BAX/BAK proteins control mitochondria-mediated apoptosis to maintain cell homeostasis via the removal of damaged cells and pathogen-infected cells. In this study, we examined the roles of BCL2 proteins in the induction of apoptosis in cells upon infection with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus and Zika virus. We showed that survival of the infected cells depends on BCLXL, a pro-survival BCL2 protein due to suppression of the expression of another pro-survival protein, MCL1. Treatment with BCLXL inhibitors, as well as deficient BCLXL gene expression, induced BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis upon infection with flaviviruses. Flavivirus infection attenuates cellular protein synthesis, which confers reduction of short-half-life proteins like MCL1. Inhibition of BCLXL increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, thereby suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. Furthermore, we examined the roles of BCLXL in the death of JEV-infected cells during in vivo infection. Haploinsufficiency of the BCLXL gene, as well as administration of BH3 mimetic compounds, increased survival rate after challenge of JEV infection and suppressed inflammation. These results suggest that BCLXL plays a crucial role in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses, and that BCLXL may provide a novel antiviral target to suppress propagation of the family of Flaviviridae viruses.

TI  - Infection with the dengue RNA virus activates TLR9 signaling in human dendritic cells
JF  - EMBO reports
VL  - 19
AB  - Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) are important sensors that recognize pathogen‐associated molecular patterns. Generally, TLR9 is known to recognize bacterial or viral DNA but not viral RNA and initiate an immune response. Herein, we demonstrate that infection with dengue virus (DENV), an RNA virus, activates TLR9 in human dendritic cells (DCs). DENV infection induces release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol and activates TLR9 signaling pathways, leading to production of interferons (IFNs). The DENV‐induced mtDNA release involves reactive oxygen species generation and inflammasome activation. DENV infection disrupts the association between transcription factor A mitochondria (TFAM) and mtDNA and activates the mitochondrial permeability transition pores. The side‐by‐side comparison of TLR9 and cyclic GMP‐AMP synthase (cGAS) knockdown reveals that both cGAS and TLR9 comparably contribute to DENV‐induced immune activation. The significance of TLR9 in DENV‐induced immune response is also confirmed in examination with the bone marrow‐derived DCs prepared from Tlr9‐knockout mice. Our study unravels a previously unrecognized phenomenon in which infection with an RNA virus, DENV, activates TLR9 signaling by inducing mtDNA release in human DCs.

JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue is an acute febrile disease triggered by dengue virus. Dengue is the widespread and rapidly transmitted mosquito-borne viral disease of humans. Diverse symptoms and diseases due to Dengue virus (DENV) infection ranges from dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (life-threatening) and dengue shock syndrome characterized by shock, endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage. Several studies have linked the severity of dengue with the induction of inflammasome. DENV activates the NLRP3-specific inflammasome in DENV infected human patients, mice; specifically, mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs), dendritic cells, endothelial cells, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), keratinocytes, monocyte-differentiated macrophages (THP-1), and platelets. Dengue virus mediated inflammasome initiates the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18, which are critical for dengue pathology and inflammatory response. Several studies have reported the molecular mechanism through which (host and viral factors) dengue induces inflammasome, unravels the possible mechanisms of DENV pathogenesis and sets up the stage for the advancement of DENV therapeutics. In this perspective article, we discuss the potential implications and our understanding of inflammasome mechanisms of dengue virus and highlight research areas that have potential to inhibit the pathogenesis of viral diseases, specifically for dengue.

TI  - Inflammatory signaling in dengue-infected platelets requires translation and secretion of nonstructural protein 1.
JF  - Blood advances
VL  - 4 9
SP  - 2018
EP  - 2031
AB  - Emerging evidence identifies major contributions of platelets to inflammatory amplification in dengue, but the mechanisms of infection-driven platelet activation are not completely understood. Dengue virus nonstructural protein-1 (DENV NS1) is a viral protein secreted by infected cells with recognized roles in dengue pathogenesis, but it remains unknown whether NS1 contributes to the inflammatory phenotype of infected platelets. This study shows that recombinant DENV NS1 activated platelets toward an inflammatory phenotype that partially reproduced DENV infection. NS1 stimulation induced translocation of α-granules and release of stored factors, but not of newly synthesized interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Even though both NS1 and DENV were able to induce pro-IL-1β synthesis, only DENV infection triggered caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release by platelets. A more complete thromboinflammatory phenotype was achieved by synergistic activation of NS1 with classic platelet agonists, enhancing α-granule translocation and inducing thromboxane A2 synthesis (thrombin and platelet-activating factor), or activating caspase-1 for IL-1β processing and secretion (adenosine triphosphate). Also, platelet activation by NS1 partially depended on toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), but not TLR-2/6. Finally, the platelets sustained viral genome translation and replication, but did not support the release of viral progeny to the extracellular milieu, characterizing an abortive viral infection. Although DENV infection was not productive, translation of the DENV genome led to NS1 expression and release by platelets, contributing to the activation of infected platelets through an autocrine loop. These data reveal distinct, new mechanisms for platelet activation in dengue, involving DENV genome translation and NS1-induced platelet activation via platelet TLR4.

TI  - Inflammatory status and severity of disease in dengue patients are associated with lipoprotein alterations
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 14
AB  - Introduction The triggering of severe dengue has been associated with an exacerbated inflammatory process characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β/IL-18, which are the product of inflammasome activation. Furthermore, alteration in the levels of high-density (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) has been observed; and HDL are known to have immunomodulatory properties, including the regulation of inflammasomes. While HDL would be expected to counteract hyperactivation of the inflammasome, the relationship between HDL and dengue severity, has not previously been explored. Methodology We conducted a cross-sectional study of 30 patients with dengue and 39 healthy controls matched by sex and age. Lipid profile and levels of C-reactive protein were quantified. Serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, and TNF-α, were assessed by ELISA. Expression of inflammasome-related genes in PBMC was quantified by qPCR. Results Dengue patients presented an alteration in the parameters of the lipid profile, with a significant decrease in HDL levels, which was more pronounced in dengue patients with warning signs. Moreover, a decrease in the expression of the inflammasome-related genes NLRP1, NLRC4, caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18 was observed, as well as an increase in serum levels of C-reactive protein and IL-10 in dengue patients versus healthy donors. Significant positive correlations between LDL levels and the relative expression of NLRP3, NLRC4, IL-1β and IL-18, were found. Conclusion The results suggest that there is a relationship between the alteration of LDL and HDL with the imbalance in the inflammatory response, which could be associated with the severity of dengue.

AB  - Abstract Dengue fever has become one of the most important human viral diseases transmitted by arthropod vector in tropical and subtropical countries of the world. As many as 100 million people are infected yearly resulting in estimated 21,000 deaths. DENV has four antigenically related but genetically distinct serotypes (DENV 1-4). Infection with any of the four serotypes may present as asymptomatic or self limiting mild febrile illness known as dengue fever (DF). However, in some dengue-infected individual, the disease progresses to its severe, life-threatening form, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) which may prove fatal without proper early intervention. The pathogenesis of DHF/DSS, however, is not yet completely understood. There are several possible reasons why the primary mild disease progresses to severe form of hemorrhagic manifestations in some individuals. The immune response, Antibody dependent enhancement, virus virulence, and host genetic background are considered risk factors contributing to disease severity. Genetic polymorphisms concerning human leukocyte antigens (HLA) with immunomodulatory effect in dengue infection have been determined in various studies. Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are highly polymorphic group of genes located on chromosome 6 of human major histocompatibility complex (MHC). HLAs expressed on the cell surface function as antigen presenting molecules and that polymorphism can change individual’s immune response. The development of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS) has been associated with HLA alleles. Several studies demonstrate the association of various identified versions (alleles) of HLA class I and class II with conferring susceptibility or protection to DHF/DSS. This review discusses recently identified associations of various HLA class I and class II alleles on enhanced or diminished immune response in the course of dengue viral infection, in ethnically and geographically distinct populations.

AB  - Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) form a group of regulatory molecules that specifically recognise human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, modulating the cytolytic activity of natural killer cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of KIR genes and their class I HLA ligands in susceptibility to dengue fever in a population from southern Brazil through a case-control study. One hundred four subjects with confirmed diagnoses of dengue participated in this study, along with a control group of 172 individuals from the same geographic area. HLA and KIR genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) and with sequence-specific primer (PCR-SSP) techniques, respectively. Data analysis showed significant differences for the KIR2DS1 (54.8% vs 40.7%, P = 0.03), KIR2DS5 (50.0% vs 36.0%, P = 0.03) and KIR2DL5 (76.0% vs 56.4%, P = 0.001) genes. With regard to KIR-ligand pairs, positive associations with dengue were observed in KIR3DS1-Bw4 (45.2% vs 29.7%, P = 0.01), KIR3DL1-Bw4 (80.7% vs 65.1%, P < 0.001), KIR2DL1-C2 (75.0% vs 62.2%, P = 0.03) and KIR2DS1-C2 (40.4% vs 25.6%, P = 0.01) interactions, and a negative association in KIR2DL3-C1/C1 (18.2% vs 33.1%, P = 0.01). Furthermore, the analysis of KIR haplogroups showed a possible protective factor against dengue fever in individuals with the AA genotype. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of genetic predisposition to dengue fever in the population from southern Brazil.

AB  - ABSTRACT During dengue virus replication, an incomplete cleavage of the envelope glycoprotein prM, generates a mixture of mature (prM-less) and prM-containing, immature extracellular particles. In this study, sequential immunoprecipitation and cryoelectron microscopy revealed a third type of extracellular particles, the partially mature particles, as the major prM-containing particles in a dengue serotype 2 virus. Changes in the proportion of viral particles in the pr-M junction mutants exhibiting altered levels of prM cleavage suggest that the partially mature particles may represent an intermediate subpopulation in the virus maturation pathway. These findings are consistent with a model suggesting the progressive mode of prM cleavage.

TI  - Information Encoded by the Flavivirus Genomes beyond the Nucleotide Sequence
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 22
AB  - The genus Flavivirus comprises numerous, small, single positive-stranded RNA viruses, many of which are important human pathogens. To store all the information required for their successful propagation, flaviviruses use discrete structural genomic RNA elements to code for functional information by the establishment of dynamic networks of long-range RNA–RNA interactions that promote specific folding. These structural elements behave as true cis-acting, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and have essential regulatory roles in the viral cycle. These include the control of the formation of subgenomic RNAs, known as sfRNAs, via the prevention of the complete degradation of the RNA genome. These sfRNAs are important in ensuring viral fitness. This work summarizes our current knowledge of the functions performed by the genome conformations and the role of RNA–RNA interactions in these functions. It also reviews the role of RNA structure in the production of sfRNAs across the genus Flavivirus, and their existence in related viruses.

TI  - Ingestion of spinosad-containing toxic sugar bait alters Aedes albopictus vector competence and vectorial capacity for dengue virus
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a highly prevalent vector-borne virus that causes life-threatening illnesses to humans worldwide. The development of a tool to control vector populations has the potential to reduce the burden of DENV. Toxic sugar bait (TSB) provides a form of vector control that takes advantage of the sugar-feeding behavior of adult mosquitoes. However, studies on the effect of ingestion of toxins in TSB on vector competence and vectorial capacity for viruses are lacking. This study evaluated vector competence for DENV serotype-1 of Aedes albopictus at 7 and 14 days post-ingestion of TSB formulated with spinosad (of bacteria origin) as an oral toxin. Our results and others were modeled to estimate effects on Ae. albopictus vectorial capacity for DENV. Ingestion of TSB caused a reduction in survival of females, but increased mosquito susceptibility to DENV infection, disseminated infection, and transmission. However, this increase in vector competence was obviated by the reduction in survival, leading to a lower predicted vectorial capacity. The findings of this study highlight the importance of evaluating the net impact of TSB ingestion on epidemiological parameters of vectorial capacity in the context of vector control efforts to reduce the risk of transmission of vector-borne viruses.

TI  - Inhibition of Alpha/Beta Interferon Signaling by the NS4B Protein of Flaviviruses
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 8004
EP  - 8013
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses are insect-borne, positive-strand RNA viruses that have been disseminated worldwide. Their genome is translated into a polyprotein, which is subsequently cleaved by a combination of viral and host proteases to produce three structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins. The nonstructural protein NS4B of dengue 2 virus partially blocks activation of STAT1 and interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoters in cells stimulated with interferon (IFN). We have found that this function of NS4B is conserved in West Nile and yellow fever viruses. Deletion analysis shows that that the first 125 amino acids of dengue virus NS4B are sufficient for inhibition of alpha/beta IFN (IFN-α/β) signaling. The cleavable signal peptide at the N terminus of NS4B, a peptide with a molecular weight of 2,000, is required for IFN antagonism but can be replaced by an unrelated signal peptide. Coexpression of dengue virus NS4A and NS4B together results in enhanced inhibition of ISRE promoter activation in response to IFN-α/β. In contrast, expression of the precursor NS4A/B fusion protein does not cause an inhibition of IFN signaling unless this product is cleaved by the viral peptidase NS2B/NS3, indicating that proper viral polyprotein processing is required for anti-interferon function.

TI  - Inhibition of Cellular Autophagy Deranges Dengue Virion Maturation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 1312
EP  - 1321
AB  - ABSTRACT Autophagy is an important component of the innate immune response, directly destroying many intracellular pathogens. However, some pathogens, including several RNA viruses, subvert the autophagy pathway, or components of the pathway, to facilitate their replication. In the present study, the effect of inhibiting autophagy on the growth of dengue virus was tested using a novel inhibitor, spautin-1 (specific and potent autophagy inhibitor 1). Inhibition of autophagy by spautin-1 generated heat-sensitive, noninfectious dengue virus particles, revealing a large effect of components of the autophagy pathway on viral maturation. A smaller effect on viral RNA accumulation was also observed. Conversely, stimulation of autophagy resulted in increased viral titers and pathogenicity in the mouse. We conclude that the presence of functional autophagy components facilitates viral RNA replication and, more importantly, is required for infectious dengue virus production. Pharmacological inhibition of host processes is an attractive antiviral strategy to avoid selection of treatment-resistant variants, and inhibitors of autophagy may prove to be valuable therapeutics against dengue virus infection and pathogenesis.

TI  - Inhibition of Dengue and Chikungunya Virus Infections by RIG-I-Mediated Type I Interferon-Independent Stimulation of the Innate Antiviral Response
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 4180
EP  - 4194
AB  - ABSTRACT RIG-I is a cytosolic sensor critically involved in the activation of the innate immune response to RNA virus infection. In the present study, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of a RIG-I agonist on the replication of two emerging arthropod-borne viral pathogens, dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), for which no therapeutic options currently exist. We demonstrate that when a low, noncytotoxic dose of an optimized 5′triphosphorylated RNA (5′pppRNA) molecule was administered, RIG-I stimulation generated a robust antiviral response against these two viruses. Strikingly, 5′pppRNA treatment before or after challenge with DENV or CHIKV provided protection against infection. In primary human monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells, the RIG-I agonist blocked both primary infection and antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection. The protective response against DENV and CHIKV induced by 5′pppRNA was dependent on an intact RIG-I/MAVS/TBK1/IRF3 axis and was largely independent of the type I IFN response. Altogether, this in vitro analysis of the antiviral efficacy of 5′pppRNA highlights the therapeutic potential of RIG-I agonists against emerging viruses such as DENV and CHIKV. IMPORTANCE DENV and CHIKV are two reemerging mosquito-borne viruses for which no therapeutic options currently exist. Both viruses overlap geographically in tropical regions of the world, produce similar fever-like symptoms, and are difficult to diagnose. This study investigated the inhibitory effect of a RIG-I agonist on the replication of these two viruses. RIG-I stimulation using 5′pppRNA before or after DENV or CHIKV infection generated a protective antiviral response against both pathogens in immune and nonimmune cells; interestingly, the protective response against the viruses was largely independent of the classical type I interferon response. The antiviral efficacy of 5′pppRNA highlights the therapeutic potential of RIG-I agonists against emerging viruses such as DENV and CHIKV.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 11648
EP  - 11658
AB  - ABSTRACT A characteristic clinical feature of dengue virus infection is thrombocytopenia, though its underlying mechanism is not definitively determined. By adoptive transfer of human CD34+ fetal liver cells into immunodeficient mice, we have constructed humanized mice with significant levels of human platelets, monocytes/macrophages, and hepatocytes. Infection of these mice with both lab-adapted and clinical strains of dengue virus induces characteristic human hematological changes, including transient leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. We show that the specific depletion of human platelets is not mediated by antibodies in the periphery or reduced production of human thrombopoietin in the liver but reduction of human megakaryocytes and megakaryocyte progenitors in the bone marrow of the infected mice. These findings identify inhibition of platelet production in the bone marrow as a key mechanism underlying dengue-induced thrombocytopenia and suggest the utility of the improved humanized mouse model in studying dengue virus infection and pathogenesis in a human cell context.

TI  - Inhibition of N‐myristoyltransferase1 affects dengue virus replication
JF  - MicrobiologyOpen
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes dengue fever, a self‐limiting disease that could be fatal due to serious complications. No specific treatment is currently available and the preventative vaccine is only partially protective. To develop a potential drug target for dengue fever, we need to understand its biology and pathogenesis thoroughly. N‐myristoyltransferase (NMT) is an N‐terminal protein lipidation enzyme that catalyzes the covalent cotranslational attachment of fatty acids to the amino‐terminal glycine residue of a number of proteins, leading to the modulation of various signaling molecules. In this study, we investigated the interaction of dengue viral proteins with host NMT and its subsequent effect on DENV. Our bioinformatics, molecular docking, and far‐western blotting analyses demonstrated the interaction of viral envelope protein (E) with NMT. The gene expression of NMT was strongly elevated in a dependent manner during the viral replication phase in dendritic cells. Moreover, NMT gene silencing significantly inhibited DENV replication in dendritic cells. Further studies investigating the target cell types of other host factors are suggested.

AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific gene-silencing mechanism in eukaryotes, which is believed to function as a defence against viruses and transposons. Since its discovery, RNAi has been developed into a widely used technique for generating genetic knock-outs and for studying gene function by reverse genetics. Additionally, inhibition of virus replication by means of induced RNAi has now been reported for numerous viruses, including several important human pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, dengue virus, poliovirus and influenza virus A. In this review, we will summarize the current data on RNAi-mediated inhibition of virus replication and discuss the possibilities for the development of RNAi-based antiviral therapeutics.

AB  - Dengue virus is a worldwide-distributed mosquito-borne flavivirus with a positive strand RNA genome. Its transcribed polyprotein is cleaved by host- and virus-encoded peptidases into 10 proteins, some of which are of unknown function. Although dengue virus-infected cells seem to be resistant to the antiviral action of IFN, the viral products that mediate this resistance are unknown. Therefore, we have analyzed the ability of the 10 dengue virus-encoded proteins to antagonize the IFN response. We found that expression in human A549 cells of the dengue virus nonstructural proteins NS2A, NS4A, or NS4B enhances replication of an IFN-sensitive virus. Moreover, expression of NS4B and, to a lesser extent, of NS2A and NS4A proteins results in down-regulation of IFN-β-stimulated gene expression. Cells expressing NS4B or infected with dengue virus do not exhibit nuclear signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 on treatment with IFN-β or IFN-γ, indicating that NS4B might be involved in blocking IFN signaling during dengue virus infections. This protein, encoded by a positive strand RNA virus, is implicated as an IFN-signaling inhibitor.

TI  - Inhibition of p38MAPK and CD137 signaling reduce dengue virus-induced TNF-α secretion and apoptosis
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 10
AB  - Hepatic injury in dengue virus (DENV) infection is authenticated by hepatomegaly and an upsurge in transaminase levels. DENV replicates in hepatocytes and causes hepatocyte apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of DENV-induced hepatic injury could facilitate the development of alternate chemotherapeutic agents and improved therapies. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) participates in both apoptosis-related signaling and pro- inflammatory cytokine production. The role of p38 MAPK in DENV-infected HepG2 cells was examined using RNA interference. The results showed that DENV infection activated p38 MAPK and induced apoptosis. The p38 MAPK activation and TNF-α production were controlled by p38 MAPK and CD137 signaling in DENV-infected HepG2 cells as activated p38 MAPK, TNF-α and apoptosis were significantly decreased in p38 MAPK and CD137 depleted DENV-infected HepG2 cells. Addition of exogenous TNF-α to p38 MAPK depleted DENV-infected HepG2 cells restored DENV-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. DENV induces CD137 signaling to enhance apoptosis by increasing TNF-α production via activation of p38 MAPK.

TI  - Inhibition of protein kinase C promotes dengue virus replication
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family, transmitted to human via mosquito. DENV infection is common in tropical areas and occasionally causes life-threatening symptoms. DENV contains a relatively short positive-stranded RNA genome, which encodes ten viral proteins. Thus, the viral life cycle is necessarily rely on or regulated by host factors. In silico analyses in conjunction with in vitro kinase assay were used to study kinases that potentially phosphorylate DENV NS5. Potential kinase was inhibited or activated by a specific inhibitor (or siRNA), or an activator. Results of the inhibition and activation on viral entry/replication and host cell survival were examined. Our in silico analyses indicated that the non-structural protein 5 (NS5), especially the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain, contains conserved phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (PKC). Phosphorylation of NS5 RdRp was further verified by PKC in vitro kinase assay. Inhibitions of PKC by a PKC-specific chemical inhibitor or siRNA suppressed NS5 phosphorylation in vivo, increased viral replication and reduced viability of the DENV-infected cells. In contrary, activation of PKC effectively suppressed intracellular viral number. These results indicated that PKC may act as a restricting mechanism that modulates the DENV replication and represses the viral outburst in the host cells.

TI  - Inhibition of the Membrane Attack Complex by Dengue Virus NS1 through Interaction with Vitronectin and Terminal Complement Proteins
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 9570
EP  - 9581
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infects millions of people worldwide and is a major public health problem. DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a conserved glycoprotein that associates with membranes and is also secreted into the plasma in DENV-infected patients. The present study describes a novel mechanism by which NS1 inhibits the terminal complement pathway. We first identified the terminal complement regulator vitronectin (VN) as a novel DENV2 NS1 binding partner by using a yeast two-hybrid system. This interaction was further assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. The NS1-VN complex was also detected in plasmas from DENV-infected patients, suggesting that this interaction occurs during DENV infection. We also demonstrated that the DENV2 NS1 protein, either by itself or by interacting with VN, hinders the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and C9 polymerization. Finally, we showed that DENV2, West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) NS1 proteins produced in mammalian cells inhibited C9 polymerization. Taken together, our results points to a role for NS1 as a terminal pathway inhibitor of the complement system. IMPORTANCE Dengue is the most important arthropod-borne viral disease nowadays and is caused by dengue virus (DENV). The flavivirus NS1 glycoprotein has been characterized functionally as a complement evasion protein that can attenuate the activation of the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways. The present study describes a novel mechanism by which DENV NS1 inhibits the terminal complement pathway. We identified the terminal complement regulator vitronectin (VN) as a novel DENV NS1 binding partner, and the NS1-VN complex was detected in plasmas from DENV-infected patients, suggesting that this interaction occurs during DENV infection. We also demonstrated that the NS1-VN complex inhibited membrane attack complex (MAC) formation, thus interfering with the complement terminal pathway. Interestingly, NS1 itself also inhibited MAC activity, suggesting a direct role of this protein in the inhibition process. Our findings imply a role for NS1 as a terminal pathway inhibitor of the complement system.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 9760
EP  - 9774
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent arthropod-borne human virus, able to infect and replicate in human dendritic cells (DCs), inducing their activation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, DENV can successfully evade the immune response in order to produce disease in humans. Several mechanisms of immune evasion have been suggested for DENV, most of them involving interference with type I interferon (IFN) signaling. We recently reported that DENV infection of human DCs does not induce type I IFN production by those infected DCs, impairing their ability to prime naive T cells toward Th1 immunity. In this article, we report that DENV also reduces the ability of DCs to produce type I IFN in response to several inducers, such as infection with other viruses or exposure to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, indicating that DENV antagonizes the type I IFN production pathway in human DCs. DENV-infected human DCs showed a reduced type I IFN response to Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Sendai virus (SeV), and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) infection and to the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). This inhibitory effect is DENV dose dependent, requires DENV replication, and takes place in DENV-infected DCs as early as 2 h after infection. Expressing individual proteins of DENV in the presence of an IFN-α/β production inducer reveals that a catalytically active viral protease complex is required to reduce type I IFN production significantly. These results provide a new mechanism by which DENV evades the immune system in humans.

JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 19
AB  - The Flavivirus genus (Flaviviridae family) contains a number of important human pathogens, including dengue and Zika viruses, which have the potential to cause severe disease. In order to efficiently establish a productive infection in mammalian cells, flaviviruses have developed key strategies to counteract host immune defences, including the type I interferon response. They employ different mechanisms to control interferon signal transduction and effector pathways, and key research generated over the past couple of decades has uncovered new insights into their abilities to actively decrease interferon antiviral activity. Given the lack of antivirals or prophylactic treatments for many flaviviral infections, it is important to fully understand how these viruses affect cellular processes to influence pathogenesis and disease outcome. This review will discuss the strategies mosquito‐borne flaviviruses have evolved to antagonise type I interferon mediated immune responses.

EP  - 51
AB  - Mosquitoes transmit numerous viral pathogens to humans including dengue virus which affects approximately 50 million individuals per year. Inhibition of viral gene expression within an insect host could be used to block virus replication and subsequent transmission of the pathogen to humans. A naturally occurring gene silencing mechanism triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), RNA interference (RNAi), has recently been described in a number of species including Drosophila. To ascertain if dsRNA-triggered RNAi is present in mosquito cells, we used Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells, and to investigate the feasibility of blocking viral gene expression and replication, we used two mosquito-borne viruses, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and the serotype 1 dengue virus (DEN1). We demonstrate that dsRNA can specifically inhibit transgene expression in C6/36 cells from both plasmid and SFV replicons and can significantly modify the kinetics of DEN1 RNA and virus replication. The inhibition mediated by dsRNA was sequence-specific and either equal or superior to that induced by antisense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). This study demonstrates dsRNA-triggered inhibition of gene expression and virus replication in mosquito cells and suggests that this mechanism could be used to block pathogen replication within an insect host and, thus, block disease transmission.

TI  - Inhibitory effect of small interfering RNA on dengue virus replication in mosquito cells
JF  - Virology Journal

AB  - BackgroundDengue viruses (DENs) are the wildest transmitted mosquito-borne pathogens throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide. Infection with DENs can cause severe flu-like illness and potentially fatal hemorrhagic fever. Although RNA interference triggered by long-length dsRNA was considered a potent antiviral pathway in the mosquito, only limited studies of the value of small interfering RNA (siRNA) have been conducted.ResultsA 21 nt siRNA targeting the membrane glycoprotein precursor gene of DEN-1 was synthesized and transfected into mosquito C6/36 cells followed by challenge with DEN. The stability of the siRNA in cells was monitored by flow cytometry. The antiviral effect of siRNA was evaluated by measurement of cell survival rate using the MTT method and viral RNA was quantitated with real-time RT-PCR. The presence of cells containing siRNA at 0.25, 1, 3, 5, 7 days after transfection were 66.0%, 52.1%, 32.0%, 13.5% and 8.9%, respectively. After 7 days incubation with DEN, there was reduced cytopathic effect, increased cell survival rate (76.9 ± 4.5% vs 23.6 ± 14.6%) and reduced viral RNA copies (Ct value 19.91 ± 0.63 vs 14.56 ± 0.39) detected in transfected C6/36 cells.ConclusionsOur data showed that synthetic siRNA against the DEN-1 membrane glycoprotein precursor gene effectively inhibited DEN-1 viral RNA replication and increased C6/36 cell survival rate. siRNA may offer a potential new strategy for prevention and treatment of DEN infection.

TI  - Initial Analysis of Gene Expressions in Response to Dengue-2 Virus Infection in Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae)
VL  - 26
SP  - 157
EP  - 165
AB  - Abstract In order to understand host responses to viral infection at the transcriptional level, differential display reverse-transcription PCR (DDRT-PCR) was used to identify molecular genetic changes in virus-infected Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) following infection with dengue 2 virus (DENV-2). Seven differentially expressed cDNA fragments were identified. Five were up-regulated in virus-infected mosquitoes and two were up-regulated in refractory individuals. Sequence comparisons at the nucleotide level in GenBank showed that clone AS09A had 100% homology to Ae. albopictus ribosomal S5 protein mRNA, 98% homology to Ae. aegypti clone AE-198A ribosomal protein S5 mRNA and the 5-prime end of clone KWOAAA2YJ20AAMI from strain Liverpool of Ae. aegypti, and 91% homology to Drosophila melanogaster ribosomal protein S5a mRNA sequence. The deduced amino acidic sequence of clone AS09A showed 100% identity or conservation to the above sequence. AS12C clone showed significant homology (95%) to Ae. aegypti strain Liverpool. Other clones did not show homology with previously reported gene sequences. The fragment of AS09A may be the ribosomal protein S5 gene of Ae. albopictus that becomes differentially expressed as a result of infection. These results may be helpful in understanding the mechanism of differential susceptibility of Ae. albopictus following dengue virus infection.

EP  - 60
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral diseases in humans worldwide, causes dengue fever, a mild form of the disease, as well as dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, a more severe form which can be life-threatening. The four serotypes of DENV (DENV1-4) are positive-sense, single stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family and are transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Together, they are estimated to cause almost 100 million symptomatic cases, 2.1 million cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, and 21,000 deaths per year worldwide. There are currently no effective vaccines or antiviral treatment for DENV. Innate immune defenses play a key role in controlling DENV infection in the early stages. Herein we review the innate antiviral immunity against DENV by delineating the intracellular mechanisms of the immune response and the evasion mechanisms evolved by the virus. A better understanding of the innate immune response will impact the development of novel animal models, antiviral drugs as well as potential targeted adjuvants for DENV vaccines.

TI  - Innate Immune Evasion Mediated by Flaviviridae Non-Structural Proteins
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 9
AB  - Flaviviridae-caused diseases are a critical, emerging public health problem worldwide. Flaviviridae infections usually cause severe, acute or chronic diseases, such as liver damage and liver cancer resulting from a hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and high fever and shock caused by yellow fever. Many researchers worldwide are investigating the mechanisms by which Flaviviridae cause severe diseases. Flaviviridae can interfere with the host’s innate immunity to achieve their purpose of proliferation. For instance, dengue virus (DENV) NS2A, NS2B3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5; HCV NS2, NS3, NS3/4A, NS4B and NS5A; and West Nile virus (WNV) NS1 and NS4B proteins are involved in immune evasion. This review discusses the interplay between viral non-structural Flaviviridae proteins and relevant host proteins, which leads to the suppression of the host’s innate antiviral immunity.

TI  - Innate Immune Response to Dengue Virus: Toll-like Receptors and Antiviral Response
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV1-4). The clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and/or Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). Viral and host factors are related to the clinical outcome of dengue, although the disease pathogenesis remains uncertain. The innate antiviral response to DENV is implemented by a variety of immune cells and inflammatory mediators. Blood monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and tissue macrophages are the main target cells of DENV infection. These cells recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Pathogen recognition is a critical step in eliciting the innate immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are responsible for the innate recognition of pathogens and represent an essential component of the innate and adaptive immune response. Ten different TLRs are described in humans, which are expressed in many different immune cells. The engagement of TLRs with viral PAMPs triggers downstream signaling pathways leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines, interferons (IFNs) and other molecules essential for the prevention of viral replication. Here, we summarize the crucial TLRs’ roles in the antiviral innate immune response to DENV and their association with viral pathogenesis.

TI  - Innate Immune Responses to Acute Viral Infection During Pregnancy
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 11
AB  - Immunological adaptations in pregnancy allow maternal tolerance of the semi-allogeneic fetus but also increase maternal susceptibility to infection. At implantation, the endometrial stroma, glands, arteries and immune cells undergo anatomical and functional transformation to create the decidua, the specialized secretory endometrium of pregnancy. The maternal decidua and the invading fetal trophoblast constitute a dynamic junction that facilitates a complex immunological dialogue between the two. The decidual and peripheral immune systems together assume a pivotal role in regulating the critical balance between tolerance and defense against infection. Throughout pregnancy, this equilibrium is repeatedly subjected to microbial challenge. Acute viral infection in pregnancy is associated with a wide spectrum of adverse consequences for both mother and fetus. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus can cause developmental anomalies, growth restriction, preterm birth and stillbirth, while the mother is predisposed to heightened morbidity and maternal death. A rapid, effective response to invasive pathogens is therefore essential in order to avoid overwhelming maternal infection and consequent fetal compromise. This sentinel response is mediated by the innate immune system: a heritable, highly evolutionarily conserved system comprising physical barriers, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and a variety of immune cells—principally neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells—which express pattern-receptors that detect invariant molecular signatures unique to pathogenic micro-organisms. Recognition of these signatures during acute infection triggers signaling cascades that enhance antimicrobial properties such as phagocytosis, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of the complement system. As well as coordinating the initial immune response, macrophages and dendritic cells present microbial antigens to lymphocytes, initiating and influencing the development of specific, long-lasting adaptive immunity. Despite extensive progress in unraveling the immunological adaptations of pregnancy, pregnant women remain particularly susceptible to certain acute viral infections and continue to experience mortality rates equivalent to those observed in pandemics several decades ago. Here, we focus specifically on the pregnancy-induced vulnerabilities in innate immunity that contribute to the disproportionately high maternal mortality observed in the following acute viral infections: Lassa fever, Ebola virus disease (EVD), dengue fever, hepatitis E, influenza, and novel coronavirus infections.

AB  - Emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus infections of humans continue to be a significant problem worldwide. It is becoming increasingly evident that development of effective vaccines, which provide life-long sterilizing immunity to viral infection, requires a proper understanding of how the host innate immune sensing pathways detect viral infection and program protective immunity. Continued studies to understand the flavivirus-host interactions with PRR pathways will provide valuable insights to overcome current challenges that have hindered effective vaccine development and prophylactic treatment strategies to prevent or combat WNV and DENV infection.

TI  - Innate Immunity Evasion by Dengue Virus
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 4
SP  - 397
EP  - 413
AB  - For viruses to productively infect their hosts, they must evade or inhibit important elements of the innate immune system, namely the type I interferon (IFN) response, which negatively influences the subsequent development of antigen-specific adaptive immunity against those viruses. Dengue virus (DENV) can inhibit both type I IFN production and signaling in susceptible human cells, including dendritic cells (DCs). The NS2B3 protease complex of DENV functions as an antagonist of type I IFN production, and its proteolytic activity is necessary for this function. DENV also encodes proteins that antagonize type I IFN signaling, including NS2A, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 by targeting different components of this signaling pathway, such as STATs. Importantly, the ability of the NS5 protein to bind and degrade STAT2 contributes to the limited host tropism of DENV to humans and non-human primates. In this review, we will evaluate the contribution of innate immunity evasion by DENV to the pathogenesis and host tropism of this virus.

TI  - Innate Lymphoid Cells Activation and Transcriptomic Changes in Response to Human Dengue Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - Background Dengue virus (DENV) infection has a global impact on public health. The clinical outcomes (of DENV) can vary from a flu-like illness called dengue fever (DF), to a more severe form, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The underlying innate immune mechanisms leading to protective or detrimental outcomes have not been fully elucidated. Helper innate lymphoid cells (hILCs), an innate lymphocyte recently discovered, functionally resemble T-helper cells and are important in inflammation and homeostasis. However, the role of hILCs in DENV infection had been unexplored. Methods We performed flow cytometry to investigate the frequency and phenotype of hILCs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from DENV-infected patients of different disease severities (DF and DHF), and at different phases (febrile and convalescence) of infection. Intracellular cytokine staining of hILCs from DF and DHF were also evaluated by flow cytometry after ex vivo stimulation. Further, the hILCs were sorted and subjected to transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to compare the febrile and convalescent phase samples in DF and DHF. Selected differentially expressed genes were then validated by quantitative PCR. Results Phenotypic analysis showed marked activation of all three hILC subsets during the febrile phase as shown by higher CD69 expression when compared to paired convalescent samples, although the frequency of hILCs remained unchanged. Upon ex vivo stimulation, hILCs from febrile phase DHF produced significantly higher IFN-γ and IL-4 when compared to those of DF. Transcriptomic analysis showed unique hILCs gene expression in DF and DHF, suggesting that divergent functions of hILCs may be associated with different disease severities. Differential gene expression analysis indicated that hILCs function both in cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity during the febrile phase of DENV infection. Conclusions Helper ILCs are activated in the febrile phase of DENV infection and display unique transcriptomic changes as well as cytokine production that correlate with severity. Targeting hILCs during early innate response to DENV might help shape subsequent immune responses and potentially lessen the disease severity in the future.

TI  - Innate and adaptive immune evasion by dengue virus
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease which causes significant public health concerns in tropical and subtropical countries. Dengue virus (DENV) has evolved various strategies to manipulate the innate immune responses of the host such as ‘hiding’ in the ultrastructure of the host, interfering with the signaling pathway through RNA modifications, inhibiting type 1 IFN production, as well as inhibiting STAT1 phosphorylation. DENV is also able to evade the adaptive immune responses of the host through antigenic variation, antigen-dependent enhancement (ADE), partial maturation of prM proteins, and inhibition of antigen presentation. miRNAs are important regulators of both innate and adaptive immunity and they have been shown to play important roles in DENV replication and pathogenesis. This makes them suitable candidates for the development of anti-dengue therapeutics. This review discusses the various strategies employed by DENV to evade innate and adaptive immunity. The role of miRNAs and DENV non-structural proteins (NS) are promising targets for the development of anti-dengue therapeutics.

AB  - Dengue is a worldwide disease with 400 million annual infections that can lead to septic shock and viral hemorrhagic fever with internal bleeding. These symptoms are the result of uncontrolled immune activation. Macrophages and dendritic cells are the main target of dengue virus (DENV) and the cellular source of cytokines associated with this immune activation. Macrophages and dendritic cells express several innate immune receptors that have been implicated in DENV immune activation, of which, CLEC5A, RIG-I and MDA5 are most important. Notably, activation of these receptors have profound effects on adaptive immune responses against DENV. This review will focus on how innate immune receptors drive DENV immune activation by inducing inflammatory cytokines and by activating adaptive immune responses.

TI  - Insect-specific viruses regulate vector competence in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes via expression of histone H4
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are major mosquito vectors for arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses. Mosquitoes also carry insect-specific viruses (ISVs) that may affect the transmission of arboviruses. Here, we analyzed the global virome in urban Aedes mosquitoes and observed that two insect-specific viruses, Phasi Charoen-like virus (PCLV) and Humaita Tubiacanga virus (HTV), were the most prevalent in A. aegypti worldwide except for African cities, where transmission of arboviruses is low. Spatiotemporal analysis revealed that presence of HTV and PCLV led to a 200% increase in the chances of having DENV in wild mosquitoes. In the laboratory, we showed that HTV and PCLV prevented downregulation of histone H4, a previously unrecognized proviral host factor, and rendered mosquitoes more susceptible to DENV and ZIKV. Altogether, our data reveals a molecular basis for the regulation of A. aegypti vector competence by highly prevalent ISVs that may impact how we analyze the risk of arbovirus outbreaks.

EP  - 7807
AB  - The incidence of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, African sleeping sickness, and tick-borne fevers is increasing. Given that current global control efforts have met with limited success, the need to develop novel interventions has become all the more vital. Successful discovery of such interventions is contingent on improving our understanding of how the pathogen interacts with its vertebrate host and also with its invertebrate vector. In this review we examine a premise developed more than 20 years ago (94) that emphasized the role of protein-carbohydrate interactions in microbial pathogenesis, and we present it in the context of vector-pathogen dynamics. 
 
Glycans are “essential macromolecules for numerous cellular processes, such as signaling, structural-support, cell-cell interaction, cell-matrix adhesion, growth, protection and trafficking” (94). Their ubiquitous yet tissue-specific occurrence as cell surface glycoconjugates has, over evolutionary time, been exploited by several pathogenic microorganisms as receptors for attachment and invasion (95). While evidence for microbial adherence to mammalian glycolipids and glycoproteins continues to grow (for reviews see references 17, 18, 58, 95, and 115), only recently has evidence for a “protein-carbohydrate recognition strategy” for vector host-pathogen interactions emerged. This review focuses on the most recent advances that describe adherence mechanisms of three different classes of pathogens—bacteria, viruses, and protozoan parasites—to their obligate arthropod vectors. We also discuss how the protein-carbohydrate recognition strategies in both vector and mammalian life stages are apparently conserved and how this conservation could lead to the development of novel strategies for intervention.

TI  - Insight into the Tropism of Dengue Virus in Humans
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - In tropical and subtropical zones, arboviruses are among the major threats to human life, affecting a large number of populations with serious diseases. Worldwide, over three hundred million people are infected with dengue virus (DENV) every year as per the World Health Organization (WHO). DENV-mediated disease severity ranges from a mild fever to hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Patients suffering from severe infection might experience multi-organ failure, cardiomyopathy and even encephalopathy, further complicating the disease pathogenesis. In life-threatening cases, DENV has been reported to affect almost all organs of the human body. In this review, we discuss the organ tropism of DENV in humans in depth as detected in various autopsy studies. Keeping in mind the fact that there is currently no DENV-specific antiviral, it is of utmost importance to achieve a vivid picture of the susceptible cells in humans which might help in designing antivirals against DENV, especially targeting those tissues in which infection might lead to life-threatening conditions.

JF  - Future Virology
VL  - 5
SP  - 575
EP  - 592
AB  - Since many antiviral drugs are designed to interfere with viral genome replication, understanding this step in the viral replicative cycle has gained importance in recent years. Replication for many RNA viruses occurs in cellular compartments mainly originated from the production and reorganization of virus-induced membranes. Dengue virus translates, replicates and assembles new viral particles within virus-induced membranes from endoplasmic reticulum. In these compartments, all of the components required for replication are recruited, making the process efficient. In addition, membranes protect replication complexes from RNAases and proteases, and ultimately make them less visible to cellular defense sensors. Although several aspects in dengue virus replication are known, many others are yet to be understood. This article aims to summarize the advances in the understanding of dengue virus genome replication, highlighting the cis as well as trans elements that may have key roles in this process.

TI  - Insights into the Internalization and Retrograde Trafficking of Dengue 2 Virus in BHK-21 Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 6
AB  - Background Dengue virus (DENV) enters cells via endocytosis, traffics to perinuclear (PN) region, the site of morphogenesis and exits by exocytosis. This study aims to understand the role of dynamin II, endosomes, microtubules (MT) and dynein in the early events of DENV replication. Findings Using double immunoflourescence labelling of DENV-2 infected BHK-21 cells it was observed that the surface envelope (E) protein of the virion associated with dynamin II from 0–30 min post infection (p.i.). The sphincter like array of dynamin II supported its pinchase-like activity. The association with endosomes was observed from 0 min at cell periphery to 30 min in the perinuclear (PN) region, suggesting that internalization continued for 30 min. Association of E protein with alpha-tubulin was observed from 8 h indicating that it was the newly translated protein that trafficked on the MT. Dynein was found to associate with the E protein from 4 h in the cytoplasm to 48 h in the PN region and dissociate at 72 h. Association of E protein with dynein was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Overexpression of dynamitin, which disrupts the dynein complex, resulted in loss of trafficking of viral E and core proteins. The findings corroborated with the growth kinetics assessed by quantitation of viral RNA in infected BHK-21 cells. The detection of E protein at 4 h–8 h correlated with detectable increase in viral RNA from 8 h. The detection of high concentrations of E protein in the PN region at 24–48 h coincided with release of virus into the supernatant starting from 36 h p.i. The dissociation of dynein from E protein by 72 h was coincident with maximum release of virus, hinting at a possible negative feedback for viral protein translation. Conclusion The study shows for the first time the association of dynamin II with DENV-2 during entry and dynein dependent retrograde trafficking of DENV proteins on microtubules.

TI  - Insights into the product release mechanism of dengue virus NS3 helicase
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 50
SP  - 6968
EP  - 6979
AB  - Abstract The non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3h) is a multifunctional protein that is critical in RNA replication and other stages in the flavivirus life cycle. NS3h uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to translocate along single stranded nucleic acid and to unwind double stranded RNA. Here we present a detailed mechanistic analysis of the product release stage in the catalytic cycle of the dengue virus (DENV) NS3h. This study is based on a combined experimental and computational approach of product-inhibition studies and free energy calculations. Our results support a model in which the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis proceeds through an ordered sequential mechanism that includes a ternary complex intermediate (NS3h-Pi-ADP), which evolves releasing the first product, phosphate (Pi), and subsequently ADP. Our results indicate that in the product release stage of the DENV NS3h a novel open-loop conformation plays an important role that may be conserved in NS3 proteins of other flaviviruses as well.

TI  - Integrated analysis of miRNAs and transcriptomes in Aedes albopictus midgut reveals the differential expression profiles of immune‐related genes during dengue virus serotype‐2 infection
JF  - Insect Science
VL  - 23
AB  - Mosquito microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in host‐virus interaction, and have been reported to be altered by dengue virus (DENV) infection in Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of Aedes albopictus midgut—the first organ to interact with DENV—involved in its resistance to DENV. Here we used high‐throughput sequencing to characterize miRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression patterns in Aedes albopictus midgut in response to dengue virus serotype 2. A total of three miRNAs and 777 mRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed upon DENV infection. For the mRNAs, we identified 198 immune‐related genes and 31 of them were differentially expressed. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses also showed that the differentially expressed immune‐related genes were involved in immune response. Then the differential expression patterns of six immune‐related genes and three miRNAs were confirmed by real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, seven known miRNA‐mRNA interaction pairs were identified by aligning our two datasets. These analyses of miRNA and mRNA transcriptomes provide valuable information for uncovering the DENV response genes and provide a basis for future study of the resistance mechanisms in Aedes albopictus midgut.

TI  - Integrative bulk and single‐cell transcriptome profiling analysis reveals IFI27 as a novel interferon‐stimulated gene in dengue
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - The dengue virus (DENV) is a public health threat to humans. Increased vascular permeability, coagulopathy, and hemorrhagic diathesis are the pathophysiological hallmarks of severe dengue. However, although the interferon (IFN)‐mediated innate immune response forms the backbone of cell‐autonomous defense against pathogens, the exact IFN‐stimulated genes (ISGs) involved in DENV infection remain to be determined. The present study collected transcriptomic data sets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from DENV patients and healthy volunteers from public data repositories. Also, lentivirus and plasmid were used to overexpress and knockdown IFI27. Initially, differentially expressed genes were filtered, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to assess related pathways. Subsequently, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and support vector machine‐recursive feature elimination algorithms were used to screen crucial genes. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was then employed to test diagnostic efficacy. Next, CIBERSORT was used to analyze immune infiltration in 22 immune cell subsets. Additionally, to dissect high‐resolution molecular phenotypes directly from individual cells and the cellular interactions between immune cell subpopulations, single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) was performed. We found that the IFN‐stimulated gene IFN‐α‐inducible protein 27 (IFI27) was highly expressed in dengue patients by leveraging bioinformatics analysis and machine learning algorithms. This finding was further validated in two independent published databases. In addition, IFI27 overexpression positively regulated DENV‐2 infection, whereas IFI27 knockdown has the opposite effect. Consistently, scRNA‐seq analysis supported this conclusion, along with further dissection of increased IFI27 expression mainly concentrated in monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We also demonstrated that IFI27 inhibited dengue infection. Moreover, IFI27 was positively correlated with monocytes, M1 macrophages, activated dendritic cells, plasma cells, and resting mast cells and negatively correlated with CD8 T cells, γδ T cells, and naïve B cells. GSEA revealed that IFI27 was primarily enriched in the innate immune response, regulation of the viral life cycle, and JAK‐STAT signaling pathway. Notably, the interactions between LGALS9 and its receptor CD47 were markedly increased in dengue patients compared to healthy controls, based on cell‐cell communication analysis. Our findings reveal, for the first time, that IFI27 is a key ISG in DENV infection. Given that the innate immune system plays a significant role in antagonizing DENV invasion, while ISGs are the ultimate antiviral effectors, IFI27 may serve as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in dengue, although further validation is warranted.

TI  - Interaction between dengue virus fusion peptide and lipid bilayers depends on peptide clustering
JF  - Molecular Membrane Biology
VL  - 25
SP  - 128
EP  - 138
AB  - Dengue fever is one of the most widespread tropical diseases in the world. The disease is caused by a virus member of the Flaviviridae family, a group of enveloped positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Dengue virus infection is mediated by virus glycoprotein E, which binds to the cell surface. After uptake by endocytosis, this protein induces the fusion between viral envelope and endosomal membrane at the acidic environment of the endosomal compartment. In this work, we evaluated by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy the interaction between the peptide believed to be the dengue virus fusion peptide and large unilamellar vesicles, studying the extent of partition, fusion capacity and depth of insertion in membranes. The roles of the bilayer composition (neutral and anionic phospholipids), ionic strength and pH of the medium were also studied. Our results indicate that dengue virus fusion peptide has a high affinity to vesicles composed of anionic lipids and that the interaction is mainly electrostatic. Both partition coefficient and fusion index are enhanced by negatively charged phospholipids. The location determined by differential fluorescence quenching using lipophilic probes demonstrated that the peptide is in an intermediate depth in the hemilayers, in-between the bilayer core and its surface. Ultimately, these data provide novel insights on the interaction between dengue virus fusion peptide and its target membranes, namely, the role of oligomerization and specific types of membranes.

TI  - Interaction of TIA-1/TIAR with West Nile and dengue virus products in infected cells interferes with stress granule formation and processing body assembly
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 104
SP  - 9041
EP  - 9046
AB  - The West Nile virus minus-strand 3′ terminal stem loop (SL) RNA was previously shown to bind specifically to cellular stress granule (SG) components, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) and the related protein TIAR. In vitro TIAR binding was 10 times more efficient than TIA-1. The 3′(−)SL functions as the promoter for genomic RNA synthesis. Colocalization of TIAR and TIA-1 with the viral replication complex components dsRNA and NS3 was observed in the perinuclear regions of West Nile virus- and dengue virus-infected cells. The kinetics of accumulation of TIAR in the perinuclear region was similar to those of genomic RNA synthesis. In contrast, relocation of TIA-1 to the perinuclear region began only after maximal levels of RNA synthesis had been achieved, except when TIAR was absent. Virus infection did not induce SGs and progressive resistance to SG induction by arsenite developed coincident with TIAR relocation. A progressive decrease in the number of processing bodies was secondarily observed in infected cells. These data suggest that the interaction of TIAR with viral components facilitates flavivirus genome RNA synthesis and inhibits SG formation, which prevents the shutoff of host translation.

TI  - Interaction of a dengue virus NS1‐derived peptide with the inhibitory receptor KIR3DL1 on natural killer cells
AB  - Killer immunoglobulin‐like receptors (KIRs) interact with human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I ligands and play a key role in the regulation and activation of NK cells. The functional importance of KIR–HLA interactions has been demonstrated for a number of chronic viral infections, but to date only a few studies have been performed in the context of acute self‐limited viral infections. During our investigation of CD8+ T cell responses to a conserved HLA‐B57‐restricted epitope derived from dengue virus (DENV) non‐structural protein‐1 (NS1), we observed substantial binding of the tetrameric complex to non‐T/non‐B lymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a long‐standing clinical cohort in Thailand. We confirmed binding of the NS1 tetramer to CD56dim NK cells, which are known to express KIRs. Using depletion studies and KIR‐transfected cell lines, we demonstrated further that the NS1 tetramer bound the inhibitory receptor KIR3DL1. Phenotypical analysis of PBMC from HLA‐B57+ subjects with acute DENV infection revealed marked activation of NS1 tetramer‐binding natural killer (NK) cells around the time of defervescence in subjects with severe dengue disease. Collectively, our findings indicate that subsets of NK cells are activated relatively late in the course of acute DENV illness and reveal a possible role for specific KIR–HLA interactions in the modulation of disease outcomes.

TI  - Interaction of dengue NS3 with human RNA silencing machinery through HSPA1A
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Viruses encode multiple proteins that interact with different host factors to aid in their establishment inside the host. Viral Suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR) are one such class of proteins that have been shown to interact with components of host machinery involved in post transcriptional gene silencing, a known antiviral defence mechanism. In the present study, we showed that dengue NS3, a known VSR not only interacts with HSPA1A, a cellular chaperone, but also modulates its expression levels. Further, we revealed HSPA1A associated with host RNA silencing machinery through its interaction with Argonaute proteins; Ago1, Ago2 and co-localizes with them in the cytoplasm of the cell. Together, these results provide evidence for involvement of other host partners in mediating VSR function of dengue NS3 and aid in deeper understanding of mechanisms underlying viral suppression of RNA silencing.

JF  - mBio
VL  - 16
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) and other flaviviruses are prevented from replicating in mosquitoes by Wolbachia. To date, several reports have appeared that highlight multiple molecular and cellular pathways involved in the blocking mechanism, which underlines the complicated nature of the mechanism. Here, we developed a hypothesis on whether Wolbachia proteins interact with pro-viral host proteins by using a unique approach to study the antiviral mechanism based on Wolbachia-host protein-protein interaction. We selected Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) for co-immunoprecipitation because of its abundance and possible secretion. We first confirmed WSP’s secretion in mosquito cells and found two host proteins, Ae. aegypti serine-threonine kinase (STK) and synaptic vesicle membrane (SVM) protein VAT-1, and one Wolbachia protein (wGroEL) interacting with WSP. We examined the role of STK and SVM genes in relation to DENV replication in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and mosquito cell lines with and without Wolbachia. In DENV-infected Aag2 cells, the expression of SVM and STK was significantly increased. However, although these genes were induced in Wolbachia-infected Aag2 cells, they were downregulated after DENV infection. Silencing of STK, but not SVM, reduced DENV replication in Aag2 cells and mosquitoes. Conversely, RNA activation of STK, by utilizing promoter induction via short activating oligos, resulted in higher DENV replication in Wolbachia-infected and uninfected cell lines. Overall, our findings suggest that STK is a pro-viral gene, and Wolbachia WSP binds to STK, possibly making it less accessible for DENV replication. IMPORTANCE Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium that blocks the replication of arboviruses in transinfected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. In this study, we focused on identifying the potential interaction of Wolbachia proteins with the host pro-viral proteins. For this, we embarked on identifying the interacting proteins with a major Wolbachia protein, WSP, which is both structural and also secreted into the host cells. An Ae. aegypti STK was identified, which is induced in DENV and Wolbachia-infected cells. Silencing or induction of the gene led to reduced and increased DENV replication in vitro. Consistently, knocking down the gene in mosquitoes resulted in decreased virus replication. We hypothesize that WSP may sequester STK, which is pro-viral, contributing to Wolbachia virus blocking.

TI  - Interactions between the Dengue Virus Polymerase NS5 and Stem-Loop A
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT The process of RNA replication by dengue virus is still not completely understood despite the significant progress made in the last few years. Stem-loop A (SLA), a part of the viral 5′ untranslated region (UTR), is critical for the initiation of dengue virus replication, but quantitative analysis of the interactions between the dengue virus polymerase NS5 and SLA in solution has not been performed. Here, we examine how solution conditions affect the size and shape of SLA and the formation of the NS5-SLA complex. We show that dengue virus NS5 binds SLA with a 1:1 stoichiometry and that the association reaction is primarily entropy driven. We also observe that the NS5-SLA interaction is influenced by the magnesium concentration in a complex manner. Binding is optimal with 1 mM MgCl2 but decreases with both lower and higher magnesium concentrations. Additionally, data from a competition assay between SLA and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) indicate that SLA competes with ssRNA for the same binding site on the NS5 polymerase. SLA70 and SLA80, which contain the first 70 and 80 nucleotides (nt), respectively, bind NS5 with similar binding affinities. Dengue virus NS5 also binds SLAs from different serotypes, indicating that NS5 recognizes the overall shape of SLA as well as specific nucleotides. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus is an important human pathogen responsible for dengue hemorrhagic fever, whose global incidence has increased dramatically over the last several decades. Despite the clear medical importance of dengue virus infection, the mechanism of viral replication, a process commonly targeted by antiviral therapeutics, is not well understood. In particular, stem-loop A (SLA) and stem-loop B (SLB) located in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) are critical for binding the viral polymerase NS5 to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis. However, little is known regarding the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters driving these interactions. Here, we quantitatively examine the energetics of intrinsic affinities, characterize the stoichiometry of the complex of NS5 and SLA, and determine how solution conditions such as magnesium and sodium concentrations and temperature influence NS5-SLA interactions in solution. Quantitatively characterizing dengue virus NS5-SLA interactions will facilitate the design and assessment of antiviral therapeutics that target this essential step of the dengue virus life cycle.

TI  - Interactions of host miRNAs in the flavivirus 3´UTR genome: From bioinformatics predictions to practical approaches
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - The genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family includes important viruses, such as Dengue, Zika, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, Yellow fever, Saint Louis encephalitis, and Usutu viruses. They are transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks, and they can infect humans, causing fever, encephalitis, or haemorrhagic fever. The treatment resources for these diseases and the number of vaccines available are limited. It has been discovered that eukaryotic cells synthesize small RNA molecules that can bind specifically to sequences present in messenger RNAs to inhibit the translation process, thus regulating gene expression. These small RNAs have been named microRNAs, and they have an important impact on viral infections. In this review, we compiled the available information on miRNAs that can interact with the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of the flavivirus genome, a conserved region that is important for viral replication and translation.

AB  - OLIVIER, D. S. Interaction between dengue fusion peptides and model membranes: an experimental and computational overview. 2016. 94 f. Thesis (Ph.D. Postgraduate program in Physics applied to Medicine and Biology) Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters, University of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto SP; Dutch Polymer Institute (DPI), PO Box 902, 5600 AX Eindhoven, the Netherlands. Dengue fever is viral infectious disease widespread in tropical and subtropical areas that infects nearly 400 million people annually. There are four different virus serotypes (DEN.I-IV) so that a reinfection by a different serotype may lead to a more severe case of the disease: dengue hemorrhagic fever and the dengue shock syndrome. During the infection cycle, the virus has two important steps: the first one is the entry in the host cell; the second one, is the fusion between the viral lipid bilayer and the endosomal membrane. Both steps are mediated by the E Glycoprotein, that is the host of the putative fusion peptide. The fusion peptide has a high degree of homology among the members of the Flaviviridae. In this work, we evaluated the interaction between modified dengue fusion peptide and model membranes through the combination of experiments (fluorescence, SAXS, DSC and Cryo-TEM), and Molecular Dynamics simulations. We evaluated the capacity of the DEN.II 88-123 peptide to promote fusion between vesicles composed by DMPC, DMPC:DMPG (4:1), as well as the ability to perturb the lipid bilayer properties. Moreover, we seek to understand how the secondary structure is affected by interaction with the model membranes and the peptide position in the membrane. We showed that the peptide is able to change the membrane lipid cooperativity depending on the

TI  - Interferome signature dynamics during the anti-dengue immune response: a systems biology characterization
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 14
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection manifests as a febrile illness with three distinct phases: early acute, late acute, and convalescent. Dengue can result in clinical manifestations with different degrees of severity, dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. Interferons (IFNs) are antiviral cytokines central to the anti-DENV immune response. Notably, the distinct global signature of type I, II, and III interferon-regulated genes (the interferome) remains uncharacterized in dengue patients to date. Therefore, we performed an in-depth cross-study for the integrative analysis of transcriptome data related to DENV infection. Our systems biology analysis shows that the anti-dengue immune response is characterized by the modulation of numerous interferon-regulated genes (IRGs) enriching, for instance, cytokine-mediated signaling (e.g., type I and II IFNs) and chemotaxis, which is then followed by a transcriptional wave of genes associated with cell cycle, also regulated by the IFN cascade. The adjunct analysis of disease stratification potential, followed by a transcriptional meta-analysis of the interferome, indicated genes such as IFI27, ISG15, and CYBRD1 as potential suitable biomarkers of disease severity. Thus, this study characterizes the landscape of the interferome signature in DENV infection, indicating that interferome dynamics are a crucial and central part of the anti-dengue immune response.

TI  - Interferon inhibits dengue virus infection by preventing translation of viral RNA through a PKR-independent mechanism.
JF  - Virology
VL  - 289 2
SP  - 297
EP  - 311
AB  - Previously, we demonstrated that pretreatment of cells with interferon (IFN) alpha + gamma or beta + gamma inhibited dengue virus (DV) replication. In this study, experiments were performed to better define the mechanism by which IFN blocks the accumulation of dengue virus (DV) RNA. Pretreatment of human hepatoma cells with IFN beta + gamma did not significantly alter virus attachment, viral entry, or nucleocapsid penetration into the cytoplasm. The inhibitory effect of IFN was retained even when naked DV RNA was transfected directly into cells, confirming that steps associated with viral entry were not the primary target of IFN action. Biosynthetic labeling experiments revealed that IFN abolished the translation of infectious viral RNA that occurred prior to RNA replication. Subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that IFN did not significantly alter the ability of viral RNA to attach to ribosomes. The antiviral effect of IFN appeared independent of the IFN-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and RNase L, as genetically deficient PKR- RNase L- cells that were infected by DV retained sensitivity to inhibition by IFN. We conclude that IFN prevents DV infection by inhibiting translation of the infectious viral RNA through a novel, PKR-independent mechanism.

TI  - Interferon lambda inhibits dengue virus replication in epithelial cells
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 12
AB  - In viral disease, infection is controlled at the cellular level by type I interferon (IFN-I), but dengue virus (DENV) has the ability to inhibit this response. Type III interferon, also known as lambda IFN (IFN-III or IFN-λ), is a complementary pathway to the antiviral response by IFN-I. This work analyzed the IFN-λ (IFN-III) mediated antiviral response against DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) infection. Dengue fever patients were sampled to determine their IFN-λ levels by ELISA. To study the IFN-λ response during DENV infection we selected the epithelial cell line C33-A, and we demonstrated that it is permissive to DENV-2 infection. The effect of IFN-λ on virus replication was determined in these cells, in parallel to the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS), genes measured by RT-qPCR. We found increased (~1.8 times) serological IFN-λ in dengue fever patients compared to healthy blood donors. IFN-λ inhibited DENV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The reduction of viral titer corresponded with increased ISG mRNA levels (MX1 and OAS1), with the highest inhibition occurring at ISG’s peak expression. Presence of IFN-negative regulators, SOCS1 and SOCS3, during DENV-2 infection was associated with reduced IFN-λ1 expression. Evidence described here suggests that IFN-λ is a good candidate inhibitor of viral replication in dengue infection. Mechanisms for the cellular and organismal interplay between DENV and IFN- λ need to be further studied as they could provide insights into strategies to treat this disease. Furthermore, we report a novel epithelial model to study dengue infection in vitro.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 2701
EP  - 2710
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DEN) causes dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, which are major public health problems worldwide. The immune factors that control DEN infection or contribute to severe disease are neither well understood nor easy to examine in humans. In this study, we used wild-type and congenic mice lacking various components of the immune system to study the immune mechanisms in the response to DEN infection. Our results demonstrate that alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) and IFN-γ receptors have critical, nonoverlapping functions in resolving primary DEN infection. Furthermore, we show that IFN-α/β receptor-mediated action limits initial DEN replication in extraneural sites and controls subsequent viral spread into the central nervous system (CNS). In contrast, IFN-γ receptor-mediated responses seem to act at later stages of DEN disease by restricting viral replication in the periphery and eliminating virus from the CNS. Mice deficient in B, CD4+ T, or CD8+ T cells had no increased susceptibility to DEN; however, RAG mice (deficient in both B and T cells) were partially susceptible to DEN infection. In summary, (i) IFN-α/β is critical for early immune responses to DEN infection, (ii) IFN-γ-mediated immune responses are crucial for both early and late clearance of DEN infection in mice, and (iii) the IFN system plays a more important role than T- and B-cell-dependent immunity in resistance to primary DEN infection in mice.

TI  - Interferon-gamma gene diplotype (AA-rs2069716 / AG-rs2069727) may play an important role during secondary outcomes of severe dengue in Brazilian patients
JF  - Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo
VL  - 65
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue is a global and growing health threat, especially in Southeast Asia, West Pacific and South America. Infection by the dengue virus (DENV) results in dengue fever, which can evolve to severe forms. Cytokines, especially interferons, are involved in the immunopathogenesis of dengue fever, and so may influence the disease outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between severe forms of dengue and two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the interferon-gamma gene (IFNG): A256G (rs2069716) and A325G (rs2069727). We included 274 patients infected with DENV serotype 3: 119 cases of dengue without warning signs (DWoWS), and 155 with warning signs (DWWS) or severe dengue (SD). DNA was extracted, and genotyped with Illumina Genotyping Kit or real time PCR (TaqMan probes). We estimated the adjusted Odds Ratios (OR) by multivariate logistic regression models. When comparing with the ancestral AA/AA diplotype (A256G/A325G), we found a protective association of the AA/AG against DWWS/SD among patients with secondary dengue (OR 0.51; 95% IC 0.24-1.10, p = 0.085), adjusting for age and sex. The variant genotype at locus A325G of the IFNG, in combination with the ancestral genotype at locus A256G, can protect against severe clinical forms of secondary dengue in Brazilian DENV3-infected patients.

TI  - Interferon-stimulated TRIM69 interrupts dengue virus replication by ubiquitinating viral nonstructural protein 3
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - In order to eliminate viral infections, hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are induced via type I interferons (IFNs). However, the functions and mechanisms of most ISGs are largely unclear. A tripartite motif (TRIM) protein encoding gene TRIM69 is induced by dengue virus (DENV) infection as an ISG. TRIM69 restricts DENV replication, and its RING domain, which has the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, is critical for its antiviral activity. An in vivo study further confirmed that TRIM69 contributes to the control of DENV infection in immunocompetent mice. Unlike many other TRIM family members, TRIM69 is not involved in modulation of IFN signaling. Instead, TRIM69 interacts with DENV Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) directly and mediates its polyubiquitination and degradation. Finally, Lys104 of NS3 is identified as the target of TRIM69-mediated ubiquitination. Our study demonstrates that TRIM69 restricts DENV replication by specifically ubiquitinating a viral nonstructural protein.

TI  - Interleukin‐33 contributes to disease severity in Dengue virus infection in mice
JF  - Immunology
VL  - 155
AB  - The excessive inflammation often present in patients with severe dengue infection is considered both a hallmark of disease and a target for potential treatments. Interleukin‐33 (IL‐33) is a pleiotropic cytokine with pro‐inflammatory effects whose role in dengue has not been fully elucidated. We demonstrate that IL‐33 plays a disease‐exacerbating role during experimental dengue infection in immunocompetent mice. Mice infected with dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) produced high levels of IL‐33. DENV2‐infected mice treated with recombinant IL‐33 developed markedly more severe disease compared with untreated mice as assessed by mortality, granulocytosis, liver damage and pro‐inflammatory cytokine production. Conversely, ST2−/− mice (deficient in IL‐33 receptor) infected with DENV2 developed significantly less severe disease compared with wild‐type mice. Furthermore, the increased disease severity and the accompanying pathology induced by IL‐33 during dengue infection were reversed by the simultaneous treatment with a CXCR2 receptor antagonist (DF2156A). Together, these results indicate that IL‐33 plays a disease‐exacerbating role in experimental dengue infection, probably driven by CXCR2‐expressing cells, leading to elevated pro‐inflammatory response‐mediated pathology. Our results also indicate that IL‐33 is a potential therapeutic target for dengue infection.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 78 ( Pt 2)
SP  - 337
EP  - 41
AB  - The NS3 protein of flaviviruses is a multifunctional polypeptide required for virus replication. Enzymic activities that have been demonstrated or predicted from the presence of sequence motifs include protease, NTPase, helicase and RNA triphosphatase. Both full-length and truncated forms of NS3 have been identified in infected cells. To examine internal cleavage of the NS3 protein of dengue virus 2 (DEN-2), infected cells or COS cells transfected with cDNA encoding NS2B/3 were radiolabelled and immunoprecipitated with antiserum against NS3 or hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid. The polypeptides detected were NS2B/3 (Mr 83000), NS3 (Mr 69000), NS3' (Mr 50000) and NS3" (Mr 19000). The latter polypeptide has not been previously identified. For DEN-2, it has been proposed that NS3' results from cleavage at the site ...R457R / GR460... within an RNA helicase sequence motif of NS3. Our results demonstrated that cleavage occurred at this site, and that prior cleavage between NS2B/NS3 was not necessary.

EP  - 86
AB  - Objectives: This study sought to undertake a comparative analysis of the internalization and propagation of all four dengue serotypes in a single cell line of human liver origin, HepG2. Methods: Virus production after infection was determined by the plaque assay technique. Internalization profiles were determined by incubating virus and cells on ice and then raising the temperature for various times. The contribution of extracellular matrix components to internalization was determined by pretreatment of cells with either trypsin or heparinase III. Results: HepG2 cells were able to support the propagation of all four serotypes with mature viruses being produced by 12 h for dengue serotype 4 and by 17–18 h for the remaining serotypes. Virus internalization showed a plateau for serotypes 1, 2 and 4 entry while serotype 3 showed a constant increase in internalization for up to 5 h. Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with heparinase III or trypsin both resulted in a reduction in viral production, with the smallest effect being noted for dengue serotype 3. Conclusion: These results suggest that the interaction between the dengue virus and liver cells is a complex one that requires both protein and nonprotein elements, and has a significant serotype/strain element.

TI  - Internalization of the dengue virus is cell cycle modulated in HepG2, but not vero cells
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 74
AB  - While many studies have investigated the relationship between cell type and dengue virus infection, no study to date has examined the effect of cell physiology on permissiveness to infection. Unsynchronized and artificially synchronized cell populations at different stages of the cell cycle of two cell types (Vero and HepG2) were examined for permissiveness to infection by two dengue virus serotypes (serotypes 2 and 3) by determining both the levels of virus produced as well as the percentage of cells infected. Vero cells showed no significant differences between either viral production or percentage of cells infected as compared to unsynchronized cells for any of the phases investigated, although production of virus (for both serotypes 2 and 3) was somewhat lower for cells infected during S phase. In contrast, HepG2 cells were significantly more permissive for both infection and virus production in the G2 phase as compared to other phases examined and serotype differences in permissiveness to infection were noted with cells in the M phase of the cell cycle. These results suggest that the cell cycle may be a mediator of cell permissiveness in some cell types. J. Med. Virol. 74:434–441, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

TI  - Interplay between Inflammation and Cellular Stress Triggered by Flaviviridae Viruses
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 7
AB  - The Flaviviridae family comprises several human pathogens, including Dengue, Zika, Yellow Fever, West Nile, Japanese Encephalitis viruses, and Hepatitis C Virus. Those are enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses, which replicate mostly in intracellular compartments associated to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex. Virus replication results in abundant viral RNAs and proteins, which are recognized by cellular mechanisms evolved to prevent virus infection, resulting in inflammation and stress responses. Virus RNA molecules are sensed by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RIG-I and MDA5) and RNA-dependent protein kinases (PKR), inducing the production of inflammatory mediators and interferons. Simultaneously, the synthesis of virus RNA and proteins are distinguished in different compartments such as mitochondria, ER and cytoplasmic granules, triggering intracellular stress pathways, including oxidative stress, unfolded protein response pathway, and stress granules assembly. Here, we review the new findings that connect the inflammatory pathways to cellular stress sensors and the strategies of Flaviviridae members to counteract these cellular mechanisms and escape immune response.

TI  - Interplay of RNA Elements in the Dengue Virus 5′ and 3′ Ends Required for Viral RNA Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 6103
EP  - 6118
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the Flavivirus genus of positive-sense RNA viruses. DENV RNA replication requires cyclization of the viral genome mediated by two pairs of complementary sequences in the 5′ and 3′ ends, designated 5′ and 3′ cyclization sequences (5′-3′ CS) and the 5′ and 3′ upstream of AUG region (5′-3′ UAR). Here, we demonstrate that another stretch of six nucleotides in the 5′ end is involved in DENV replication and possibly genome cyclization. This new sequence is located downstream of the AUG, designated the 5′ downstream AUG region (5′ DAR); the motif predicted to be complementary in the 3′ end is termed the 3′ DAR. In addition to the UAR, CS and DAR motifs, two other RNA elements are located at the 5′ end of the viral RNA: the 5′ stem-loop A (5′ SLA) interacts with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and promotes RNA synthesis, and a stem-loop in the coding region named cHP is involved in translation start site selection as well as RNA replication. We analyzed the interplay of these 5′ RNA elements in relation to RNA replication, and our data indicate that two separate functional units are formed; one consists of the SLA, and the other includes the UAR, DAR, cHP, and CS elements. The SLA must be located at the 5′ end of the genome, whereas the position of the second unit is more flexible. We also show that the UAR, DAR, cHP, and CS must act in concert and therefore likely function together to form the tertiary RNA structure of the circularized DENV genome.

JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common arbovirus, causing a significant burden on both the economy and global healthcare systems. The virus is transmitted by Aedes species of mosquitoes as a swarm of closely related virus genomes, collectively referred to as a quasispecies. The level of genomic diversity within this quasispecies varies as DENV moves through various ecological niches within its transmission cycle. Here, the factors that influence the level of DENV quasispecies diversity during the course of infection in the mosquito vectors are reviewed.

TI  - Intra-host growth kinetics of dengue virus in the mosquito Aedes aegypti
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 15
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) transmission by mosquitoes is a time-dependent process that begins with the consumption of an infectious blood-meal. DENV infection then proceeds stepwise through the mosquito from the midgut to the carcass, and ultimately to the salivary glands, where it is secreted into saliva and then transmitted anew on a subsequent bite. We examined viral kinetics in tissues of the Aedes aegypti mosquito over a finely graded time course, and as per previous studies, found that initial viral dose and serotype strain diversity control infectivity. We also found that a threshold level of virus is required to establish body-wide infections and that replication kinetics in the early and intermediate tissues do not predict those of the salivary glands. Our findings have implications for mosquito GMO design, modeling the contribution of transmission to vector competence and the role of mosquito kinetics in the overall DENV epidemiological landscape.

TI  - Intracellular Interactions Between Arboviruses and Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Aedes aegypti is inherently susceptible to arboviruses. The geographical expansion of this vector host species has led to the persistence of Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya human infections. These viruses take advantage of the mosquito’s cell to create an environment conducive for their growth. Arboviral infection triggers transcriptomic and protein dysregulation in Ae. aegypti and in effect, host antiviral mechanisms are compromised. Currently, there are no existing vaccines able to protect human hosts from these infections and thus, vector control strategies such as Wolbachia mass release program is regarded as a viable option. Considerable evidence demonstrates how the presence of Wolbachia interferes with arboviruses by decreasing host cytoskeletal proteins and lipids essential for arboviral infection. Also, Wolbachia strengthens host immunity, cellular regeneration and causes the expression of microRNAs which could potentially be involved in virus inhibition. However, variation in the magnitude of Wolbachia’s pathogen blocking effect that is not due to the endosymbiont’s density has been recently reported. Furthermore, the cellular mechanisms involved in this phenotype differs depending on Wolbachia strain and host species. This prompts the need to explore the cellular interactions between Ae. aegypti-arboviruses-Wolbachia and how different Wolbachia strains overall affect the mosquito’s cell. Understanding what happens at the cellular and molecular level will provide evidence on the sustainability of Wolbachia vector control.

TI  - Intracellular Nucleic Acid Delivery by the Supercharged Dengue Virus Capsid Protein
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 8
AB  - Supercharged proteins are a recently identified class of proteins that have the ability to efficiently deliver functional macromolecules into mammalian cells. They were first developed as bioengineering products, but were later found in the human proteome. In this work, we show that this class of proteins with unusually high net positive charge is frequently found among viral structural proteins, more specifically among capsid proteins. In particular, the capsid proteins of viruses from the Flaviviridae family have all a very high net charge to molecular weight ratio (> +1.07/kDa), thus qualifying as supercharged proteins. This ubiquity raises the hypothesis that supercharged viral capsid proteins may have biological roles that arise from an intrinsic ability to penetrate cells. Dengue virus capsid protein was selected for a detailed experimental analysis. We showed that this protein is able to deliver functional nucleic acids into mammalian cells. The same result was obtained with two isolated domains of this protein, one of them being able to translocate lipid bilayers independently of endocytic routes. Nucleic acids such as siRNA and plasmids were delivered fully functional into cells. The results raise the possibility that the ability to penetrate cells is part of the native biological functions of some viral capsid proteins.

VL  - 83 Pt 12
SP  - 3093
EP  - 102
AB  - In dengue virus (DEN) particles, the core protein is a structural protein of the nucleocapsid. The core protein is known to be present in the nucleus of DEN-infected cells but there have been conflicting reports as to whether it is also present in the nucleolus. To clarify this, the intracellular location of the core protein was examined using a monoclonal antibody, 15B11, which was produced in this study. Immunofluorescence staining with this antibody demonstrated that the core protein first appeared in the cytoplasm and then in the nuclei and nucleoli of infected cells. Nuclear localization of the core protein was determined to be independent of other DEN proteins, since recombinant core proteins still entered the nuclei and nucleoli of cells transfected with only the core protein gene. Three putative nuclear localization signal motifs have been predicted to be present on the core protein. Deletion of the first one (KKAR), located at aa 6-9, and mutation of the second one (KKSK), located at aa 73-76, did not eliminate the nuclear localization property of the core protein. The third motif with a bipartite structure, RKeigrmlnilnRRRR, located at aa 85-100, was determined to be responsible for the nuclear localization of the core protein, since the core protein without this motif was located exclusively in the cytoplasm of DEN-infected cells and that this motif mediated nuclear localization of a normally cytoplasmic protein.

TI  - Intrahepatic Infiltrating NK and CD8 T Cells Cause Liver Cell Death in Different Phases of Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Elevated liver enzyme level is an outstanding feature in patients with dengue. However, the pathogenic mechanism of liver injury has not been clearly demonstrated. In this study, employing a mouse model we aimed to investigate the immunopathogenic mechanism of dengue liver injury. Immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice were infected intravenously with dengue virus strain 16681. Infected mice had transient viremia, detectable viral capsid gene and cleaved caspase 3 in the liver. In the mean time, NK cell and T cell infiltrations peaked at days 1 and 5, respectively. Neutralizing CXCL10 or depletion of Asialo GM1+ cells reduced cleaved caspase 3 and TUNEL+ cells in the liver at day 1 after infection. CD8+ T cells infiltrated into the liver at later time point and at which time intrahepatic leukocytes (IHL) exhibited cytotoxicity against DENV-infected targets. Cleaved caspase 3 and TUNEL+ cells were diminished in mice with TCRβ deficiency and in those depleted of CD8+ T cells, respectively, at day 5 after infection. Moreover, intrahepatic CD8+ T cells were like their splenic counterparts recognized DENV NS4B99–107 peptide. Together, these results show that infiltrating NK and CD8+ T cells cause liver cell death. While NK cells were responsible for cell death at early time point of infection, CD8+ T cells were for later. CD8+ T cells that recognize NS4B99–107 constitute at least one of the major intrahepatic cytotoxic CD8+ T cell populations.

TI  - Intricacy of Mitochondrial Dynamics and Antiviral Response During RNA Virus Infection
VL  - 2
AB  - Viruses are known to hijack the intracellular organelles, including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, lipid droplets, and cytoskeleton to promote its replication. The host responds to invading viruses by mounting antiviral responses and rearrangement of its organelles. In particular, the mitochondria are one of the target organelles exploited by viruses and their proteins to suppress the host antiviral response. In this review, we have comprehensively summarized the impact of mitochondrial dynamics in modulating antiviral response during emerging and re-emerging RNA virus infections caused by genus Flavivirus (Dengue virus, Zika virus, Hepatitis C virus), and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to knowledge gaps in mitochondria-virus interaction studies, we discuss recent advancements in therapeutics regulating the mitochondrial dynamics to combat viral infections.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus and related viruses in the Flaviviridae family (such as dengue virus, yellow fever virus or West Nile virus) are amongst the most important human pathogens, causing substantial morbidity and mortality world-wide. The production of viral progeny in Flaviviridae is orchestrated by the small, multifunctional core protein, which coats and condenses the viral genomic RNA during Nucleocapsid formation. In addition to their structural role, mounting experimental evidence links core proteins to viral persistence and pathogenesis, by virtue of their promiscuous interactions with host cell factors. In this review, we summarize the present knowledge about the structure of Flaviviridae core proteins and discuss the importance of flexible, intrinsically unstructured protein regions in viral assembly and hub formation in the virus-host protein-protein interaction network (infection network).

TI  - Invariant NKT Cell Response to Dengue Virus Infection in Human
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 8
AB  - Background Dengue viral infection is a global health threat without vaccine or specific treatment. The clinical outcome varies from asymptomatic, mild dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). While adaptive immune responses were found to be detrimental in the dengue pathogenesis, the roles of earlier innate events remain largely uninvestigated. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells represent innate-like T cells that could dictate subsequent adaptive response but their role in human dengue virus infection is not known. We hypothesized that iNKT cells play a role in human dengue infection. Methods Blood samples from a well-characterized cohort of children with DF, DHF, in comparison to non-dengue febrile illness (OFI) and healthy controls at various time points were studied. iNKT cells activation were analyzed by the expression of CD69 by flow cytometry. Their cytokine production was then analyzed after α-GalCer stimulation. Further, the CD1d expression on monocytes, and CD69 expression on conventional T cells were measured. Results iNKT cells were activated during acute dengue infection. The level of iNKT cell activation associates with the disease severity. Furthermore, these iNKT cells had altered functional response to subsequent ex vivo stimulation with α-GalCer. Moreover, during acute dengue infection, monocytic CD1d expression was also upregulated and conventional T cells also became activated. Conclusion iNKT cells might play an early and critical role in the pathogenesis of severe dengue viral infection in human. Targeting iNKT cells and CD1d serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for severe dengue infection in the future.

TI  - Invariant NKT Cells: Regulation and Function during Viral Infection
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 8
AB  - Natural killer T cells (NKT cells) represent a subset of T lymphocytes that express natural killer (NK) cell surface markers. A subset of NKT cells, termed invariant NKT cells (iNKT), express a highly restricted T cell receptor (TCR) and respond to CD1d-restricted lipid ligands. iNKT cells are now appreciated to play an important role in linking innate and adaptive immune responses and have been implicated in infectious disease, allergy, asthma, autoimmunity, and tumor surveillance. Advances in iNKT identification and purification have allowed for the detailed study of iNKT activity in both humans and mice during a variety of chronic and acute infections. Comparison of iNKT function between non-pathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection models and chronic HIV-infected patients implies a role for iNKT activity in controlling immune activation. In vitro studies of influenza infection have revealed novel effector functions of iNKT cells including IL-22 production and modulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, but ex vivo characterization of human iNKT cells during influenza infection are lacking. Similarly, as recent evidence suggests iNKT involvement in dengue virus pathogenesis, iNKT cells may modulate responses to a number of emerging pathogens. This Review will summarize current knowledge of iNKT involvement in responses to viral infections in both human and mouse models and will identify critical gaps in knowledge and opportunities for future study. We will also highlight recent efforts to harness iNKT ligands as vaccine adjuvants capable of improving vaccination-induced cellular immune responses.

Blood group O exhibited the highest infection rates at ∼50%, whereas group AB had the lowest at ∼9% among the participants in the study. Yet, when considering the general population's blood group distribution, the combined odds of infection were 2.0, 3.5, and 1.4 times higher in groups B, O, and AB, respectively, than in group A. Infection rates were greater in Rh-negative people. Blood groups B, O, and AB showed higher susceptibility than blood group A according to adjusted odds ratios. Blood groups ABO and Rh factor hold significance in disease susceptibility and vaccine effectiveness. Keeping these implications in mind, further investigations are necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying these connections and their effects on the efficacy of dengue and chikungunya vaccines.

TI  - Investigation of TNF-α and DC-SIGN promoter polymorphisms in patients with dengue fever in Lahore city of Pakistan
JF  - BioMedica
AB  - Background and Objective: Dengue fever (DF) has been a major health concern globally. Pakistan is also combating this infection for the last decade. Cytokine genes play an important role in DF pathogenesis. This study aimed to analyze dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) genes promoter polymorphisms in DF patients. 
Methods: A total of 140 (n = 140) dDF patients were recruited for study at the Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Biology of University of Health Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan over a period of 3 years. Simple DF was noted in 105 patients (75%) while 35 (25%) showed bleeding complications. All patients were found positive for dengue non-structural protein or dengue IgM. All patients were tested for two polymorphisms in TNF-α (-238G/A, and -308G/A) and one polymorphism in DC-SIGN (-336G/A) using restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. A single nucleotide polymorphism stats program was used for statistical analysis. 
Results: Susceptibility to develop dengue infection in the presence of -336G allele odds ratio (OR = 27.95, p = <0.0001) and GG genotype (OR = 183.77, p = <0.0001) was found to be significantly associated in this study. Presence of a combination of alleles -336G/-238A/-308A was noted in 59.4% of DF cases and 7.6% healthy controls, a difference with statistical significance (OR = 31.46, p = <0.0001). Moreover, prevalence of DF symptoms showed a trend higher in G-carriers versus non-G-carriers of DC-SIGN -336 polymorphism. 
Conclusion: This work suggests a potential association of DC-SIGN -336 polymorphism with susceptibility to develop symptomatic dengue illness. However, no potential association was found between TNF-α promoter polymorphisms and dengue infection in this study.

TI  - Investigation of sphingosine kinase 1 in interferon responses during dengue virus infection
JF  - Clinical & Translational Immunology
VL  - 6
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) regulates sphingosine kinase (SK)‐1 activity and chemical inhibition of SK1 reduces DENV infection. In primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (pMEFs) lacking SK1 however, DENV infection is enhanced and this is associated with induction of normal levels of interferon beta (IFN‐β) but reduced levels of IFN‐stimulated genes (ISGs). We have further investigated this link between SK1 and type I IFN responses. DENV infection downregulates cell‐surface IFN‐alpha receptor (IFNAR)1 in both wild‐type (WT) and SK1−/− pMEF, but, consistent with poor ISG responses, shows reduced induction of phosphorylated (p)‐STAT1 and key IFN regulatory factors (IRF)1 and −7 in SK1−/− pMEF. Direct IFN stimulation induced ISGs (viperin, IFIT1), CXCL10, IRF1 and −7 and p‐STAT1. Responses, however, were significantly reduced in SK1−/− pMEF, except for IFN‐stimulated CXCL10 and IRF7. Poor IFN responses in SK1−/− pMEF were associated with a small reduction in basal cell‐surface IFNAR1 and IRF1 mRNA in uninfected SK1−/− compared with WT pMEF. In contrast, treatment of cells with the SK1 inhibitor, SK1‐I or expression of an inhibitory SK1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA), both of which reduce DENV infection, does not alter basal IRF1 mRNA or affect type I IFN stimulation of p‐STAT1. Thus, cells genetically lacking SK1 can induce many responses normally following DENV infection, but have adaptive changes in IFNAR1 and IRF1 that compromise DENV‐induced type I IFN responses. This suggests a biological link between SK1 and IFN‐stimulated pathways. Other approaches to reduce SK1 activity, however, do not influence these important antiviral pathways but reduce infection and may be useful antiviral strategies.

TI  - Involvement of Tetraspanin C189 in Cell-to-Cell Spreading of the Dengue Virus in C6/36 Cells
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 9
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is naturally transmitted by mosquitoes to humans, infecting cells of both hosts. Unlike in mammalian cells, DENV usually does not cause extremely deleterious effects on cells of mosquitoes. Despite this, clustered progeny virions were found to form infection foci in a high density cell culture. It is thus interesting to know how the virus spreads among cells in tissues such as the midgut within live mosquitoes. This report demonstrates that cell-to-cell spread is one way for DENV to infect neighboring cells without depending on the “release and entry” mode. In the meantime, a membrane-bound vacuole incorporating tetraspanin C189 was formed in response to DENV infection in the C6/36 cell and was subsequently transported along with the contained virus from one cell to another. Knockdown of C189 in DENV-infected C6/36 cells is shown herein to reduce cell-to-cell transmission of the virus, which may be recovered by co-transfection with a C189-expressing vector in DENV-infected C6/36 cells. Moreover, cell-to-cell transmission usually occurred at the site where the donor cell directly contacts the recipient cell. It suggested that C189 is crucially involved in the intercellular spread of progeny viral particles between mosquito cells. This novel finding presumably accounts for the rapid and efficient infection of DENV after its initial replication within tissues of the mosquito.

TI  - Involvement of fatty acid synthase in dengue virus infection
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 14
AB  - The mosquito transmitted Dengue virus (DENV) remains a significant public health problem in many tropical and subtropical countries. Increasing evidence has suggested that during the infection process cellular lipids play important roles at several stages of the replication cycle. This study sought to characterize the changes in lipid metabolism gene expression and investigated the role of one enzyme, fatty acid synthase, in DENV infection. Transcriptional profiles of genes associated with lipid metabolism were evaluated by real-time PCR after infection of different cell lines (HepG2 and HEK293T/17) and with different DENVs (laboratory adapted and low passage). Expression profiles of genes were evaluated by western blotting. A critical lipid metabolism protein, fatty acid synthase was down-regulated through siRNA and inhibited with orlistat and the effect on DENV infection determined by flow cytometry, plaque assay, western blotting and confocal microscopy. The results showed alterations of gene transcription and expression were seen in genes variously associated with lipogenesis, lipolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation during DENV infection. Interference of fatty acid synthase with either siRNA or orlistat had marked effects on virus production, with orlistat having an EC50 value of 10.07 μM at 24 h post infection. However, non-structural protein expression was largely unaffected. While drug treatment reduced virus titer by up to 3Log10, no significant effect on DENV non-structural protein expression was observed, suggesting that fatty acid synthase acts through an effect on virion formation.

TI  - Involvement of oxidative stress, NF-IL-6, and RANTES expression in dengue-2-virus-infected human liver cells.
JF  - Virology
VL  - 276 1
SP  - 114
EP  - 26
AB  - The liver has been suspected to be one of the major targets of dengue virus infection. Here, we detected increasing secretion of the chemokine RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), which functions to recruit the immune cells, in dengue-virus-infected liver cells and patients. Three luciferase reporter genes with various deletions at the 5'-end of the RANTES promoter were constructed to explore the RANTES activation mechanism in human liver cells. The reporter gene was optimally activated by dengue-2 virus when the RANTES promoter contains the region from the transcription starting site (+1) to the nucleotide at the -181 position. NF-IL-6 and an undefined factor forming DNA-protein complexes in the RANTES promoter E and A/B regions in the infected cells were demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Further analysis showed that oxidative stress was an upstream inducer of NF-IL-6 and RANTES signaling in dengue-virus-infected liver cells. This finding was demonstrated by three antioxidants (N-acetyl-l-cysteine, nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) used to suppress the activation. In contrast, the DNA binding activity of the undefined factor was not affected by the antioxidant treatment, indicating the existence of an oxidant-independent pathway. We hypothesize that dengue virus infection of the liver cells may trigger both an oxidant-dependent and an oxidant-independent pathway to up-regulate RANTES mRNA expression through activating NF-IL-6 and an undefined factor, respectively. In conclusion, the present study suggests a new direction for the study of liver pathogenesis involving RANTES in host immune responses during dengue virus infection.

TI  - Is Diabetes a Risk Factor for a Severe Clinical Presentation of Dengue? - Review and Meta-analysis
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 9
AB  - Background The mean age of acute dengue has undergone a shift towards older ages. This fact points towards the relevance of assessing the influence of age-related comorbidities, such as diabetes, on the clinical presentation of dengue episodes. Identification of factors associated with a severe presentation is of high relevance, because timely treatment is the most important intervention to avert complications and death. This review summarizes and evaluates the published evidence on the association between diabetes and the risk of a severe clinical presentation of dengue. Methodology/Findings A systematic literature review was conducted using the MEDLINE database to access any relevant association between dengue and diabetes. Five case-control studies (4 hospital-based, 1 population-based) compared the prevalence of diabetes (self-reported or abstracted from medical records) of persons with dengue (acute or past; controls) and patients with severe clinical manifestations. All except one study were conducted before 2009 and all studies collected information towards WHO 1997 classification system. The reported odds ratios were formally summarized by random-effects meta-analyses. A diagnosis of diabetes was associated with an increased risk for a severe clinical presentation of dengue (OR 1.75; 95% CI: 1.08–2.84, p = 0.022). Conclusions/Significance Large prospective studies that systematically and objectively obtain relevant signs and symptoms of dengue fever episodes as well as of hyperglycemia in the past, and at the time of dengue diagnosis, are needed to properly address the effect of diabetes on the clinical presentation of an acute dengue fever episode. The currently available epidemiological evidence is very limited and only suggestive. The increasing global prevalence of both dengue and diabetes justifies further studies. At this point, confirmation of dengue infection as early as possible in diabetes patients with fever if living in dengue endemic regions seems justified. The presence of this co-morbidity may warrant closer observation for glycemic control and adapted fluid management to diminish the risk for a severe clinical presentation of dengue.

TI  - Isolation of Endogenously Assembled RNA-Protein Complexes Using Affinity Purification Based on Streptavidin Aptamer S1
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 16
SP  - 22456
EP  - 22472
AB  - Efficient isolation of endogenously assembled viral RNA-protein complexes is essential for understanding virus replication mechanisms. We have developed an affinity purification strategy based on an RNA affinity tag that allows large-scale preparation of native viral RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). The streptavidin-binding aptamer S1 sequence was inserted into the 3′ end of dengue virus (DENV) 5′–3′ UTR RNA, and the DENV RNA UTR fused to the S1 RNA aptamer was expressed in living mammalian cells. This allowed endogenous viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assembly and isolation of RNPs from whole cell extract, through binding the S1 aptamer to streptavidin magnetic beads. Several novel host DENV RBPs were subsequently identified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), including RPS8, which we further implicate in DENV replication. We proposed efficient S1 aptamer-based isolation of viral assembled RNPs from living mammalian cells will be generally applicable to the purification of high- and low-affinity RBPs and RNPs under endogenous conditions.

TI  - Isolation of midgut escape mutants of two American genotype dengue 2 viruses from Aedes aegypti
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 10
AB  - Several studies have shown that American genotype dengue 2 viruses (DENV2) have reduced viral fitness in the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, compared to other DENV2 genotypes. Diminished replication efficiency or inability to efficiently traverse membrane barriers encompassing organs such as the midgut or salivary glands are considered major factors negatively impacting viral fitness in the mosquito. We analyzed the vector competence of Ae. aegypti for two American DENV2 strains, QR94 and PR159 originating from Mexico and Puerto-Rico, respectively. Both strains infected mosquito midguts following acquisition of infectious bloodmeals. However, DENV2-QR94 and DENV2-PR159 poorly disseminated from the midgut at 7 or 14 days post-bloodmeal (pbm). We detected one virus isolate, EM33, among 31 DENV2-QR94 infected mosquitoes, and one isolate, EM41, among 121 DENV2-PR159 infected mosquitoes, generating high virus titers in mosquito carcasses at 7 days pbm. In oral challenge experiments, EM33 and EM41 showed midgut dissemination rates of 40-50%. Replication efficiency of EM41 in secondary mosquito tissue was similar to that of a dissemination-competent control strain, whereas the replication efficiency of EM33 was significantly lower than that of the control virus. The genome sequence of DENV2-QR94 encoded seven unique amino acids (aa), which were not found in 100 of the most closely related DENV2 strains. EM33 had one additional aa change, E202K, in the E protein. DENV2-PR159 encoded four unique aa residues, one of them E202K, whereas EM41 had two additional aa substitutions, Q77E in the E protein and E93D in NS3. Our results indicate that the midgut of Ae. aegypti acts as a selective sieve for DENV2 in which genetically distinct, dissemination-competent virus variants are rapidly selected from the viral quasispecies to be transmitted to vertebrates.

TI  - JNK pathway restricts DENV2, ZIKV and CHIKV infection by activating complement and apoptosis in mosquito salivary glands
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - Arbovirus infection of Aedes aegypti salivary glands (SGs) determines transmission. However, there is a dearth of knowledge on SG immunity. Here, we characterized SG immune response to dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses using high-throughput transcriptomics. We also describe a transcriptomic response associated to apoptosis, blood-feeding and lipid metabolism. The three viruses differentially regulate components of Toll, Immune deficiency (IMD) and c-Jun N- terminal Kinase (JNK) pathways. However, silencing of the Toll and IMD pathway components showed variable effects on SG infection by each virus. In contrast, regulation of the JNK pathway produced consistent responses in both SGs and midgut. Infection by the three viruses increased with depletion of the activator Kayak and decreased with depletion of the negative regulator Puckered. Virus-induced JNK pathway regulates the complement factor, Thioester containing protein-20 (TEP20), and the apoptosis activator, Dronc, in SGs. Individual and co-silencing of these genes demonstrate their antiviral effects and that both may function together. Co-silencing either TEP20 or Dronc with Puckered annihilates JNK pathway antiviral effect. Upon infection in SGs, TEP20 induces antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), while Dronc is required for apoptosis independently of TEP20. In conclusion, we revealed the broad antiviral function of JNK pathway in SGs and showed that it is mediated by a TEP20 complement and Dronc-induced apoptosis response. These results expand our understanding of the immune arsenal that blocks arbovirus transmission.

TI  - Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathway is crucial in chemokine production from hepatocytes infected by dengue virus
JF  - Experimental Biology and Medicine
VL  - 236
SP  - 1156
EP  - 1165
AB  - Hepatocytes are one of the important targets in dengue virus (DV) infection. Chemokines produced in DV infection play important immunopathogenic roles. We previously showed that DV infection can directly activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in dendritic cells. In the present study, we examined the possible involvement of the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT3 pathway in chemokine production from DV-infected hepatocytes. HepG2 cells were infected by DV. The activation of STAT3, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and other transcription factors was determined by Western blotting or electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The concentrations of chemokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Virus titers were determined by plaque assays. A genetic manipulation with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was applied to knock-down STAT3. Chemotaxis assays were used to evaluate cell migration. We observed that DV infection induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and its DNA-binding activity and such effects were attenuated by the inhibitor of JAK2 or JAK3. Blocking JAK2 or JAK3 reduced DV-induced cell migration and production of chemokines like interleukin-8 and regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). At high doses, the JAK2 but not JAK3 inhibitor could significantly inhibit DV production. Knocking down STAT3 with shRNA suppressed DV-induced STAT3, NF-κB and AP-1 activation. Furthermore, reduction of STAT3 suppressed DV-induced chemokine production and cell migration but had no effect on virus production. In conclusion, the results show that the JAK/STAT3 pathway is critical in chemokine production from DV-infected hepatocytes. Targeting this pathway may be of benefit in the therapy of DV-induced immunopathologies.

TI  - KIR2DL2, KIR2DL5A and KIR2DL5B Genes Induce Susceptibility to Dengue Virus Infection, while KIR3DL3 and KIR2DS5 Confer Protection
JF  - Mediterranean Journal of Hematology and Infectious Diseases
VL  - 14
AB  - Background and Objectives Dengue fever (DF), an emerging and re-emerging viral disease, is a major public health problem. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of KIRs genes polymorphism and KIRs genotypes in susceptibility to dengue virus infection and disease severity in a population from Burkina Faso through a case-control study. Methods KIRs genes determination was performed using PCR-SSP in 50 patients infected by dengue virus (DENV) and 54 Healthy controls (HC) subjects who had never been infected. Results Data analysis showed significant association between frequencies of three KIR genes and dengue virus infection (DF): KIR2DL2 (OR: 7.32; IC: 2.87–18.65; P < 0.001); KIR2DL5A (OR: 15.00, IC: 5.68–39.59; P < 0.001) and KIR2DL5B (OR: 11.43; IC: 4.42–29; P < 0.001). While, KIR3DL3 (OR: 0.13, IC: 0.052–0.32; P < 0.001) and KIR2DS5 (OR: 0.12; IC: 0.04–0.30; P < 0.001) were associated with protection against DF. KIR2DL4 (OR: 9.75; IC95%: 1.33–70.97; p: 0.03) and KIRD3DL1 (OR: 12.00; IC95%: 1.60–90.13; p: 0.02) were associated with an increased risk in the development of secondary dengue infection (SDI). Conclusion The results suggest a contribution of KIR2DL2, KIR2DL5A, and KIR2DL5B genes in the susceptibility of DF development. In contrast, KIR3DL3 and KIR2DS5 were associated with protection against DF development by enhancing both innate and acquired immune responses.

TI  - Kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) interacts with NS1 and is a susceptibility factor for dengue virus infection in mosquito cells
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - A hallmark of the dengue virus (DENV) infection is the manipulation of host cell membranes, lipid trafficking and lipid droplets (LDs), all cellular functions that depend on the cytoskeleton and the cytoplasmatic streaming system. We previously reported the interaction between DENV NS1 protein and members of the kinesin motor complex in the Aedes albopictus cell line C6/36. In this work, we present evidence indicating that the protein kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) is indeed a susceptibility factor for DENV replicative cycle in mosquito cells. The interaction between NS1 and KLC1 was confirmed by proximity ligation and co-immunoprecipitation assays in cells harvested 24 hpi. In addition, transmission immunoelectron microscopy showed KLC1 decorating the surface of vacuoles in association with NS1. Increased levels of KLC1 were observed starting at 6 hpi, suggesting that virus infection stimulates KLC1 synthesis. Silencing KLC1 expression results in a reduction in viral genome synthesis, decreased secretion of NS1, and a reduction of virus progeny by nearly 1 log. In agreement, similar affectations were observed in infected cells transfected with a peptide that competes and interferes with the interaction between KLC1 and its cargo molecules. Of note, both silencing the expression or interfering with the function of KLC1 resulted in a disorganization of LDs, which decreased in number and increased in area, in mock or infected cells. These results, taken together, suggest that KLC1 is a host susceptibility factor for DENV in mosquito cells, necessary for the proper transport and homeostasis of LDs required for flavivirus replication. However, modest colocalization was observed between NS1 and LDs, and the significance of the KLC1 and NS1 interactions need to be further investigated.

TI  - Kinetic Changes of Peripheral Blood Monocyte Subsets and Expression of Co-Stimulatory Molecules during Acute Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 10
AB  - Monocytes, one of the main target cells for dengue virus (DENV) infection, contribute to the resolution of viremia and to pathogenesis. We performed a longitudinal study by a detailed phenotypic comparison of classical (CD14++CD16−, non-classical (CD14+CD16++) and intermediate (CD14++CD16+) monocyte subsets in blood samples from dengue fever (DF) to the severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and healthy individuals. Various costimulatory molecules of CD40, CD80, CD86 and inducible costimulatory ligand (ICOSL) expressed on these three monocyte subsets were also analyzed. DENV-infected patients showed an increase in the frequency of intermediate monocytes and a decrease in the classical monocytes when compared to healthy individuals. Although these differences did not correlate with disease severity, changes during the early phase of infection gradually returned to normal in the defervescence phase. Moreover, decreased frequency of classical monocytes was associated with a significant up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD86 and ICOSL. Kinetics of these co-stimulatory molecule-expressing classical monocytes showed different patterns throughout the sampling times of acute DENV infection. Different distribution of monocyte subsets and their co-stimulatory molecules in the peripheral blood during acute infection might exacerbate immune responses like cytokine storms and ADE, and future studies on intracellular molecular pathways utilized by these monocyte linages are warranted.

TI  - Kinetics of CD69 Expression on Natural Killer Cells During Acute Phase of Dengue Infection
JF  - 
VL  - 2
AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction: Dengue infection is major annual public health problem in Indonesia. NK cells have a role in cellular immunity to viral infection, however only a few studies of NK cells and were conducted in vivo especially in Indonesia. Objectives: To explore the kinetics of CD 69 expression on NK cells during the acute phase of dengue infection. Methods: Observational cohort study in Dr. Sardjito Hospital was conducted. Clinical data and laboratory data was collected to measure the number of activated NK cells (CD69) using flowcytometry. The percentage of CD69 then calculated using non- parametric test (Kuskal-Wallis Test) and Student t-test. The fluorescence intensity of CD69 was also analyzed. Results: The mean of activated NK cells (CD69) percentage was higher during the early days of acute phase (day 2 to day3), and continuously declined until the seventh day but statistically they were not significant. Fluorescence intensity of CD69 showed its peak during the fifth day of fever. Conclusion: CD69 expression on activated NK cells were increased during the early days (day 2-day 3) of acute fever but decreased after that (day 4-day 7). The highest intensity of CD69 expression was on the fifth day of fever. Keywords: Dengue infection, kinetics, NK cell, CD69, cellular immune response, acute phase, adults.

TI  - Kinetics of NS1 and anti-NS1 IgG following dengue infection reveals likely early formation of immune complexes in secondary infected patients
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 15
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a major health concern throughout the world infecting up to 390 million people globally each year. Infection with any one of the four DENV serotypes produces a spectrum of clinical illness ranging from a mild undifferentiated febrile disease through to severe dengue involving fever and haemorrhage. There is currently no antiviral treatment for dengue and only one licensed vaccine with limited distribution. This study characterises the kinetics of the serological dengue biomarker, NS1, and the appearance of anti-NS1 IgG, anti-E IgM and anti-E IgG responses in patients with primary and secondary infections. Blood samples were collected daily from a cohort of 52 Vietnamese patients during the acute phase of disease. NS1 was detected in 85% of patient samples from disease onset with detection decreasing throughout the acute phase of disease. Anti-NS1 IgG detected from the fourth day of illness and anti-E IgM and IgG from the third day of illness, were all observed to increase throughout the course of the disease. During secondary infection, NS1 levels rapidly decrease with the increasing levels of anti-NS1 IgG, suggesting the possibility of NS1 immune complex formation and a potential role in the pathogenesis of the severe forms of disease associated with secondary infections.

TI  - Knockdown of NEAT1 restricts dengue virus replication by augmenting interferon alpha-inducible protein 27 via the RIG-I pathway.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 104 1
AB  - The lncRNA NEAT1 plays a vital role in mitochondrial function and antiviral response. We have previously identified NEAT1 as dysregulated lncRNAs and found an inverse correlation with interferon alpha-inducible protein 27 (IFI27) expression associated with developing dengue severity. However, the role of NEAT1 in dengue virus (DV) infection remains elusive. Here, we undertook a study to evaluate the functional consequences of NEAT1 and IFI27 modulation on antiviral response and viral replication in dengue infection. We observed that the knockdown of NEAT1 augmented IFI27 expression and antiviral response via the RIG-I pathway. Increased antiviral response leads to a decrease in dengue viral replication. Further study suggested that the knockdown of IFI27 augmented expression of the activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a negative regulator of antiviral response, and increased dengue virus replication suggesting an important role played by IFI27 in mediating antiviral response. RNA sequencing study confirmed several mitochondrial genes significantly altered upon knockdown of NEAT1 in DV-infected cells. We further verified the effect of NEAT1 knockdown on mitochondrial functions. We observed a reduced level of phospho-DRP1(S616) expression along with elongated mitochondria in DV2-infected cells. Further, NEAT1 knockdown or ectopic expression of IFI27 increased mitochondrial ROS production and cell death via activation of caspase 3. Our study points to the crucial role of NEAT1 and IFI27 in mediating antiviral response and mitochondrial dysfunction in dengue infection.

TI  - LSm1 binds to the Dengue virus RNA 3' UTR and is a positive regulator of Dengue virus replication.
JF  - International journal of molecular medicine
VL  - 35 6
SP  - 1683
EP  - 9
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that can cause severe disease in humans. The DENV positive strand RNA genome contains 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) that have been shown to be required for virus replication and interaction with host cell proteins. In the present study LSm1 was identified as a host cellular protein involved in DENV RNA replication. By using two independent methodologies, we demonstrated a critical interaction between LSm1 and the 3' UTR of DENV. Furthermore, the confocal immunofluorescence analysis showed that the interaction between LSm1 and viral RNA is located in P-body around nucleoli in the cytoplasm. LSm1 knockdown by siRNA specifically reduced the levels of viral RNA in DENV-infected cells and infectious DENV particles in the supernatant. These results provide evidence that LSm1 binding to the DENV RNA 3' UTR positively regulates DENV RNA replication.

TI  - Lack of Clinical Manifestations in Asymptomatic Dengue Infection Is Attributed to Broad Down-Regulation and Selective Up-Regulation of Host Defence Response Genes
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - Objectives Dengue represents one of the most serious life-threatening vector-borne infectious diseases that afflicts approximately 50 million people across the globe annually. Whilst symptomatic infections are frequently reported, asymptomatic dengue remains largely unnoticed. Therefore, we sought to investigate the immune correlates conferring protection to individuals that remain clinically asymptomatic. Methods We determined the levels of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and gene expression profiles of host immune factors in individuals with asymptomatic infections, and whose cognate household members showed symptoms consistent to clinical dengue infection. Results We observed broad down-regulation of host defense response (innate, adaptive and matrix metalloprotease) genes in asymptomatic individuals as against symptomatic patients, with selective up-regulation of distinct genes that have been associated with protection. Selected down-regulated genes include: TNF α (TNF), IL8, C1S, factor B (CFB), IL2, IL3, IL4, IL5, IL8, IL9, IL10 and IL13, CD80, CD28, and IL18, MMP8, MMP10, MMP12, MMP15, MMP16, and MMP24. Selected up-regulated genes include: RANTES (CCL5), MIP-1α (CCL3L1/CCL3L3), MIP-1β (CCL4L1), TGFβ (TGFB), and TIMP1. Conclusion Our findings highlight the potential association of certain host genes conferring protection against clinical dengue. These data are valuable to better explore the mysteries behind the hitherto poorly understood immunopathogenesis of subclinical dengue infection.

TI  - Lack of augmenting effect of interferon‐γ on dengue virus multiplication in human peripheral blood monocytes
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 45
AB  - The effect of interferon—γ (IFN‐γ) on dengue virus multiplication in human peripheral blood mono‐cytes was investigated. Enriched monocytes were treated with IFN‐γ and then infected with dengue virus type 2 either directly or in the presence of optimal infection‐enhancing levels of antibodies. Pretreatment of monocytes from dengue‐immune donors with 100 IU/ml of IFN‐γ caused 12‐ to 97‐fold and 13‐ to 137‐fold reduction of virus yields at 24 hr after infection in the absence and presence of an anti‐flavivirus monoclonal antibody, respectively. IFN‐γ also diminished virus yields when infection of monocytes from a donor who lacked anti‐dengue antibody was enhanced 40‐fold. The percentage of infected monocytes in IFN‐γ‐pretreated cultures was similarly reduced. Dominance of the antiviral effect of IFN‐γ in monocytes is in contrast to an augmenting effect previously observed in the promonocytic cell line U937. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

TI  - Lectin Switching During Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - The Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 203
SP  - 1775
EP  - 1783
AB  - Abstract Dengue virus receptors are relatively poorly characterized, but there has been recent interest in 2 C-type lectin molecules, dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3)–grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and its close homologue liver/lymph node–specific ICAM-3–grabbing integrin (L-SIGN), which can both bind dengue and promote infection. In this report we have studied the interaction of dengue viruses produced in insect cells, tumor cell lines, and primary human dendritic cells (DCs) with DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. Virus produced in primary DCs is unable to interact with DC-SIGN but remains infectious for L-SIGN–expressing cells. Skin-resident DCs may thus be a site of initial infection by insect-produced virus, but DCs will likely not participate in large-scale virus replication during dengue infection. These results reveal that differential glycosylation of dengue virus envelope protein is highly dependent on cell state and suggest that studies of virus tropism using virus prepared in insect cells or tumor cell lines should be interpreted with caution.

TI  - Let‐7e inhibits TNF‐α expression by targeting the methyl transferase EZH2 in DENV2‐infected THP‐1 cells
JF  - Journal of Cellular Physiology
VL  - 233
SP  - 8605
EP  - 8616
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), an important inflammatory cytokine, is associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), a severe pathological manifestation of dengue virus (DENV) infection. However, the regulatory mechanism of microRNA on TNFα is currently unknown. Our study showed that the TNFα expression increased immediately and then later decreased, while a marked increase for the miRNA let‐7e was detected in dengue virus type 2 (DENV2)‐infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). From this study, we found that let‐7e was able to inhibit TNFα expression, but bioinformatics analysis showed that the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was the potential direct target of let‐7e instead of TNFα. EZH2 methyl transferase can produce H3K27me3 and has a negative regulatory role. Using a dual‐luciferase reporter assay and Western blotting, we confirmed that EZH2 was a direct target of let‐7e and found that siEZH2 could inhibit TNFα expression. In the further study of the regulatory mechanism of EZH2 on TNFα expression, we showed that siEZH2 promoted EZH1 and H3K4me3 expression and inhibited H3K27me3 expression. More importantly, we revealed that siEZH2 down‐regulated NF‐κB p65 within the nucleus. These findings indicate that the let‐7e/EZH2/H3K27me3/NF‐κB p65 pathway is a novel regulatory axis of TNFα expression. In addition, we determined the protein differences between siEZH2 and siEZH2‐NC by iTRAQ and found a number of proteins that might be associated with TNFα.

TI  - Let’s Get Physical: Flavivirus-Host Protein–Protein Interactions in Replication and Pathogenesis
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - Flaviviruses comprise a genus of viruses that pose a significant burden on human health worldwide. Transmission by both mosquito and tick vectors, and broad host tropism contribute to the presence of flaviviruses globally. Like all viruses, they require utilization of host molecular machinery to facilitate their replication through physical interactions. Their RNA genomes are translated using host ribosomes, synthesizing viral proteins that cooperate with each other and host proteins to reshape the host cell into a factory for virus replication. Thus, dissecting the physical interactions between viral proteins and their host protein targets is essential in our comprehension of how flaviviruses replicate and how they alter host cell behavior. Beyond replication, even single interactions can contribute to immune evasion and pathogenesis, providing potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. Here, we review protein interactions between flavivirus and host proteins that contribute to virus replication, immune evasion, and disease.

TI  - Levels of 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 and Vitamin D Receptor Polymorphism in Severe Dengue Cases from New Delhi
JF  - Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease
VL  - 5
AB  - Background: Dengue is the “phoenix” that never went to ashes. First identified in 1943, in Japan, dengue virus has worldwide distribution and is a grave public health concern in developing countries like India; Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted among adults suspected of having dengue fever and attending Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism was completed for the detection of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism; Results: Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 (vitamin D) levels were found to be 1.6 times elevated in severe dengue cases as compared to healthy controls. Vitamin D levels were significantly higher in secondary infections compared to primary infections as well as secondary severe dengue cases as compared to secondary non-severe cases (p value < 0.05). A significant association of the T allele (rs2228570) was seen in severe dengue cases, while, when comparing the A/A with A/C and C/C genotypes (rs7975232) among dengue cases and healthy controls, the odds ratio was estimated to be 1.24 (0.55–2.75, p > 0.05) and 0.28 (0.08–0.96, p < 0.05) respectively; Conclusions: The present study is an attempt at decoding the role of vitamin D in dengue disease pathogenesis and exploring the role of genetic polymorphism in dengue disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Levels of CXCL10 Chemokine in Dengue Infected Hepatocyte Huh 7 it-1 Cell Line Co-cultured with Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells
JF  - Microbiology Indonesia
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito borne virus that spreads rapidly in the world. At present, it is estimated that more than 3.9 billion people are at risk of being infected with dengue virus (DENV) and there are 96 million clinical cases that have been reported annually in 128 countries worldwide. In DENV infected patients often associated with liver dysfunction which hepatocyte and kuppfer cells as the main target of viral infections. DENV infection induced the expression of several chemokines, which might play an important role during the inflammatory response and pathogenesis of a disease. CXCL10 is known as a chemokine that activated lymphocytes for innate and adaptive immunity, induces tissue damage, and modulates tumor formation. Therefore, we conducted an in vitro study using Huh 7it-1 cells co-cultured with Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) to investigate CXCL10 chemokine induction during DENV infection. Huh 7it-1 cells were grown on 96 micro well plate until a monolayer was formed. The cells were infected with DENV-2 MOI 0.5 FFU/cell and 1 FFU/cell in the presence of PBMCs. Huh7 cell medium were used as negative control. After 2 hours of infection, cells were co-cultured with PBMCs and incubated at 37 oC with 5% CO for 48 hours. Cell supernatant was collected and CXCL10 chemokine 2 levels were measured using CXCL10 Quantikine ELISA Kit. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 23. In the presence of PBMCs, CXCL10 levels from Huh 7it-1 infected by DENV-2 MOI 0,5 FFU/cell and 1 FFU/cell -1 -1 were 552,653 ± 22,779 pg mL and 576,787 ± 16,901 pg mL , those levels were higher than negative control. As  conclusion, DENV-2 infected Huh 7it-1 cells were able to induce the secretion of CXCL10 from PBMC.

TI  - Life as a Vector of Dengue Virus: The Antioxidant Strategy of Mosquito Cells to Survive Viral Infection
JF  - Antioxidants
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease of increasing global importance. The disease has caused heavy burdens due to frequent outbreaks in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. The dengue virus (DENV) is generally transmitted between human hosts via the bite of a mosquito vector, primarily Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus as a minor species. It is known that the virus needs to alternately infect mosquito and human cells. DENV-induced cell death is relevant to the pathogenesis in humans as infected cells undergo apoptosis. In contrast, mosquito cells mostly survive the infection; this allows infected mosquitoes to remain healthy enough to serve as an efficient vector in nature. Overexpression of antioxidant genes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutaredoxin (Grx), thioredoxin (Trx), and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) have been detected in DENV2-infected mosquito cells. Additional antioxidants, including GST, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5a), and p53 isoform 2 (p53-2), and perhaps some others, are also involved in creating an intracellular environment suitable for cell replication and viral infection. Antiapoptotic effects involving inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) upregulation and subsequent elevation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities also play crucial roles in the ability of mosquito cells to survive DENV infection. This article focused on the effects of intracellular responses in mosquito cells to infection primarily by DENVs. It may provide more information to better understand virus/cell interactions that can possibly elucidate the evolutionary pathway that led to the mosquito becoming a vector.

TI  - Ligand-Bound Structures of the Dengue Virus Protease Reveal the Active Conformation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 438
EP  - 446
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral hemorrhagic disease that is a major threat to human health in tropical and subtropical regions. Here we report crystal structures of a peptide covalently bound to dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) protease as well as the serine-protease inhibitor aprotinin bound to the same enzyme. These structures reveal, for the first time, a catalytically active, closed conformation of the DENV protease. In the presence of the peptide, the DENV-3 protease forms the closed conformation in which the hydrophilic β-hairpin region of NS2B wraps around the NS3 protease core, in a manner analogous to the structure of West Nile virus (WNV) protease. Our results confirm that flavivirus proteases form the closed conformation during proteolysis, as previously proposed for WNV. The current DENV-3 protease structures reveal the detailed interactions at the P4′ to P3 sites of the substrate. The new structural information explains the sequence preference, particularly for long basic residues in the nonprime side, as well as the difference in substrate specificity between the WNV and DENV proteases at the prime side. Structural analysis of the DENV-3 protease-peptide complex revealed a pocket that is formed by residues from NS2B and NS3; this pocket also exists in the WNV NS2B/NS3 protease structure and could be targeted for potential antivirus development. The structural information presented in the current study is invaluable for the design of specific inhibitors of DENV protease.

TI  - Limited Dengue Virus Replication in Field-Collected Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes Infected with Wolbachia
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 8
AB  - Introduction Dengue is one of the most widespread mosquito-borne diseases in the world. The causative agent, dengue virus (DENV), is primarily transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a species that has proved difficult to control using conventional methods. The discovery that A. aegypti transinfected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia showed limited DENV replication led to trial field releases of these mosquitoes in Cairns, Australia as a biocontrol strategy for the virus. Methodology/Principal Findings Field collected wMel mosquitoes that were challenged with three DENV serotypes displayed limited rates of body infection, viral replication and dissemination to the head compared to uninfected controls. Rates of dengue infection, replication and dissemination in field wMel mosquitoes were similar to those observed in the original transinfected wMel line that had been maintained in the laboratory. We found that wMel was distributed in similar body tissues in field mosquitoes as in laboratory ones, but, at seven days following blood-feeding, wMel densities increased to a greater extent in field mosquitoes. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that virus-blocking is likely to persist in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes after their release and establishment in wild populations, suggesting that Wolbachia biocontrol may be a successful strategy for reducing dengue transmission in the field.

AB  - Amphisomes are pre-autolysosomal vacuoles formed upon the fusion of autophagosomes with endosomes, and as such represent a critical meeting point between endocytic and autophagic pathways. Dengue virus enters into susceptible cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and colocalization of dengue markers with markers of both autophagic and endosomal vesicles demonstrated that amphisomes are a site of dengue virus replication and translation. This work links for the first time the processes of dengue virus entry and translation/replication, and allows for interpretation of the early part of the dengue virus life cycle in terms of a continual association with membranes of an endosomal-autophagosomal lineage.

TI  - Lipases secreted by a gut bacterium inhibit arbovirus transmission in mosquitoes
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 18
AB  - Arboviruses are etiological agents of various severe human diseases that place a tremendous burden on global public health and the economy; compounding this issue is the fact that effective prophylactics and therapeutics are lacking for most arboviruses. Herein, we identified 2 bacterial lipases secreted by a Chromobacterium bacterium isolated from Aedes aegypti midgut, Chromobacterium antiviral effector-1 (CbAE-1) and CbAE-2, with broad-spectrum virucidal activity against mosquito-borne viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and Sindbis virus (SINV). The CbAEs potently blocked viral infection in the extracellular milieu through their lipase activity. Mechanistic studies showed that this lipase activity directly disrupted the viral envelope structure, thus inactivating infectivity. A mutation in the lipase motif of CbAE-1 fully abrogated the virucidal ability. Furthermore, CbAEs also exert lipase-dependent entomopathogenic activity in mosquitoes. The anti-arboviral and entomopathogenic properties of CbAEs render them potential candidates for the development of novel transmission control strategies against vector-borne diseases.

TI  - Lipid Interactions Between Flaviviruses and Mosquito Vectors
JF  - Frontiers in Physiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses, threaten a large part of the human populations. In absence of therapeutics and effective vaccines against each flaviviruses, targeting viral metabolic requirements in mosquitoes may hold the key to new intervention strategies. Development of metabolomics in the last decade opened a new field of research: mosquito metabolomics. It is now clear that flaviviruses rely on mosquito lipids, especially phospholipids, for their cellular cycle and propagation. Here, we review the biosyntheses of, biochemical properties of and flaviviral interactions with mosquito phospholipids. Phospholipids are structural lipids with a polar headgroup and apolar acyl chains, enabling the formation of lipid bilayer that form plasma- and endomembranes. Phospholipids are mostly synthesized through the de novo pathway and remodeling cycle. Variations in headgroup and acyl chains influence phospholipid physicochemical properties and consequently the membrane behavior. Flaviviruses interact with cellular membranes at every step of their cellular cycle. Recent evidence demonstrates that flaviviruses reconfigure the phospholipidome in mosquitoes by regulating phospholipid syntheses to increase virus multiplication. Identifying the phospholipids involved and understanding how flaviviruses regulate these in mosquitoes is required to design new interventions.

AB  - Lipid droplets were long considered to be simple storage structures, but they have recently been shown to be dynamic organelles involved in diverse biological processes, including emerging roles in innate immunity. Various intracellular pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites, specifically target host lipid droplets during their life cycle. Viruses such as hepatitis C, dengue, and rotaviruses use lipid droplets as platforms for assembly. Bacteria, such as mycobacteria and Chlamydia, and parasites, such as trypanosomes, use host lipid droplets for nutritional purposes. The possible use of lipid droplets by intracellular pathogens, as part of an anti‐immunity strategy, is an intriguing question meriting further investigation in the near future.

EP  - 8
AB  - Dengue viral antigens have been demonstrated in several types of naturally infected human tissues, but little is known of whether these same tissues have detectable viral RNA. We studied tissue specimens from patients with serologically or virologically confirmed dengue infections by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), to localize viral antigen and RNA, respectively. IHC was performed on specimens obtained from 5 autopsies and 24 biopsies and on 20 blood-clot samples. For ISH, antisense riboprobes to the dengue E gene were applied to tissue specimens in which IHC was positive. Viral antigens were demonstrated in Kupffer and sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver; macrophages, multinucleated cells, and reactive lymphoid cells in the spleen; macrophages and vascular endothelium in the lung; kidney tubules; and monocytes and lymphocytes in blood-clot samples. Positive-strand viral RNA was detected in the same IHC-positive cells found in the spleen and blood-clot samples. The strong, positive ISH signal in these cells indicated a high copy number of viral RNA, suggesting replication.

TI  - Long non‐coding subgenomic flavivirus RNAs have extended 3D structures and are flexible in solution
JF  - EMBO Reports
VL  - 20
AB  - Most mosquito‐borne flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), Dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV), produce long non‐coding subgenomic RNAs (sfRNAs) in infected cells that link to pathogenicity and immune evasion. Until now, the structural characterization of these lncRNAs remains limited. Here, we studied the 3D structures of individual and combined subdomains of sfRNAs, and visualized the accessible 3D conformational spaces of complete sfRNAs from DENV2, ZIKV, and WNV by small angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS) and computational modeling. The individual xrRNA1s and xrRNA2s adopt similar structures in solution as the crystal structure of ZIKV xrRNA1, and all xrRNA1‐2s form compact structures with reduced flexibility. While the DB12 of DENV2 is extended, the DB12s of ZIKV and WNV are compact due to the formation of intertwined double pseudoknots. All 3′ stem‐loops (3′SLs) share similar rod‐like structures. Complete sfRNAs are extended and sample a large conformational space in solution. Our work not only provides structural insight into the function of flavivirus sfRNAs, but also highlights strategies of visualizing other lncRNAs in solution by SAXS and computational methods.

TI  - Long-Range RNA-RNA Interactions Circularize the Dengue Virus Genome
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 6631
EP  - 6643
AB  - ABSTRACT Secondary and tertiary RNA structures present in viral RNA genomes play essential regulatory roles during translation, RNA replication, and assembly of new viral particles. In the case of flaviviruses, RNA-RNA interactions between the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome have been proposed to be required for RNA replication. We found that two RNA elements present at the ends of the dengue virus genome interact in vitro with high affinity. Visualization of individual molecules by atomic force microscopy reveled that physical interaction between these RNA elements results in cyclization of the viral RNA. Using RNA binding assays, we found that the putative cyclization sequences, known as 5′ and 3′ CS, present in all mosquito-borne flaviviruses, were necessary but not sufficient for RNA-RNA interaction. Additional sequences present at the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of the viral RNA were also required for RNA-RNA complex formation. We named these sequences 5′ and 3′ UAR (upstream AUG region). In order to investigate the functional role of 5′-3′ UAR complementarity, these sequences were mutated either separately, to destroy base pairing, or simultaneously, to restore complementarity in the context of full-length dengue virus RNA. Nonviable viruses were recovered after transfection of dengue virus RNA carrying mutations either at the 5′ or 3′ UAR, while the RNA containing the compensatory mutations was able to replicate. Since sequence complementarity between the ends of the genome is required for dengue virus viability, we propose that cyclization of the RNA is a required conformation for viral replication.

TI  - Loquacious modulates flaviviral RNA replication in mosquito cells
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 18
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses infect both mosquito and mammalian hosts. While much is known about virus-host interactions that modulate viral gene expression in their mammalian host, much less is known about the interactions that involve inhibition, subversion or avoidance strategies in the mosquito host. A novel RNA-Protein interaction detection assay was used to detect proteins that directly or indirectly bind to dengue viral genomes in infected mosquito cells. Membrane-associated mosquito proteins SEC61A1 and Loquacious (Loqs) were found to be in complex with the viral RNA. Depletion analysis demonstrated that both SEC61A1 and Loqs have pro-viral functions in the dengue viral infectious cycle. Co-localization and pull-down assays showed that Loqs interacts with viral protein NS3 and both full-length and subgenomic viral RNAs. While Loqs coats the entire positive-stranded viral RNA, it binds selectively to the 3’ end of the negative-strand of the viral genome. In-depth analyses showed that the absence of Loqs did not affect translation or turnover of the viral RNA but modulated viral replication. Loqs also displayed pro-viral functions for several flaviviruses in infected mosquito cells, suggesting a conserved role for Loqs in flavivirus-infected mosquito cells. Author Summary There is a wealth of information that dictates virus-host interactions in flavivirus-infected mammalian cells, yet there is only sparse information on the mechanisms that modulate viral gene expression in the mosquito host. Using a novel RNA-protein detection assay, the interactions of SEC61A1 and Loqs with the dengue viral genome were found to have proviral functions in infected mosquito cells. In particular, Loqs forms complexes with the positive-strand of the viral RNA and the very 3’ end of the negative-strand viral RNA. Further analyses showed that Loqs modulates viral RNA replication of dengue virus and gene amplification of several other flaviviral genomes. These findings argue that Loqs is an essential proviral host factor in mosquitos.

TI  - Low density lipopolyprotein inhibits flavivirus acquisition in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Insect Molecular Biology
VL  - 26
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of a number of human pathogens including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Ae. aegypti acquires these viruses during the processing of bloodmeals obtained from an infected vertebrate host. Vertebrate blood contains a number of factors that have the potential to modify virus acquisition in the mosquito. Interestingly, low density lipopolyprotein (LDL) levels are decreased during severe DENV infection. Accordingly, we hypothesized that LDL is a modifiable factor that can influence flavivirus acquisition in the mosquito. We found that LDL is endocytosed by Ae. aegypti cells in a dynamin‐dependent manner. LDL is also endocytosed by midgut epithelial cells and accumulates at the luminal midgut epithelium during bloodmeal digestion. Importantly, pretreatment with LDL, but not high density lipopolyprotein (HDL), significantly inhibited both DENV and ZIKV infection in vitro, and LDL inhibited ZIKV infection in vivo. This study identifies human LDL or ‘bad cholesterol’ as a modifiable factor that can inhibit flavivirus acquisition in Ae. aegypti. Identification of modifiable blood factors and critical cellular interactions that mediate pathogen acquisition may lead to novel strategies to disrupt the transmission cycle of vector‐borne diseases.

TI  - Lyn kinase regulates egress of flaviviruses in autophagosome-derived organelles
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 11
AB  - Among the various host cellular processes that are hijacked by flaviviruses, few mechanisms have been described with regard to viral egress. Here we investigate how flaviviruses exploit Src family kinases (SFKs) for exit from infected cells. We identify Lyn as a critical component for secretion of Dengue and Zika infectious particles and their corresponding virus like particles (VLPs). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs, Lyn in particular, block virus secretion. Lyn−/− cells are impaired in virus release and are rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We establish that virus particles are secreted in two distinct populations – one as free virions and the other enclosed within membranes. Lyn is critical for the latter, which consists of proteolytically processed, infectious virus progenies within autophagosome-derived vesicles. This process depends on Ulk1, Rab GTPases and SNARE complexes implicated in secretory but not degradative autophagy and occur with significantly faster kinetics than the conventional secretory pathway. Our study reveals a previously undiscovered Lyn-dependent exit route of flaviviruses in LC3+ secretory organelles that enables them to evade circulating antibodies and might affect tissue tropism. Egress of flaviviruses and involved host pathways are not well understood. Here, the authors show that Lyn is a critical host kinase for Dengue and Zika virus egress resulting in infectious virus progenies within autophagosome-derived vesicles, which might help the virus to evade antibody responses.

TI  - MAIT cells are activated in acute Dengue virus infection and after in vitro Zika virus infection
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are members of the Flaviviridae and are predominantly transmitted via mosquito bites. Both viruses are responsible for a growing number of infections in tropical and subtropical regions. DENV infection can cause lethargy with severe morbidity and dengue shock syndrome leading to death in some cases. ZIKV is now linked with Guillain-Barré syndrome and fetal malformations including microcephaly and developmental disorders (congenital Zika syndrome). The protective and pathogenic roles played by the immune response in these infections is unknown. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a population of innate T cells with potent anti-bacterial activity. MAIT cells have also been postulated to play a role in the immune response to viral infections. In this study, we evaluated MAIT cell frequency, phenotype, and function in samples from subjects with acute and convalescent DENV infection. We found that in acute DENV infection, MAIT cells had elevated co-expression of the activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR and had a poor IFNγ response following bacterial stimulation. Furthermore, we found that MAIT cells can produce IFNγ in response to in vitro infection with ZIKV. This MAIT cell response was independent of MR1, but dependent on IL-12 and IL-18. Our results suggest that MAIT cells may play an important role in the immune response to Flavivirus infections.

TI  - MCP-1 Reduction by L-SIGN Expression in Dengue Virus-Infected Liver Endothelial Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 17
AB  - (1) Background: The C-type lectin domain family 4 member M (CLEC4M, also known as L-SIGN) is a crucial pathogen-recognition receptor for the dengue virus (DENV). Our previous study has exhibited a polymorphism in its extracellular neck region, specifically within the long tandem repeats of exon 4, which correlates with DHF in DENV infection and causes liver damage. (2) Methods: Using monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) and SK-HEP1 liver endothelial cell lines to compare viral replication relative to L-SIGN expression. (3) Results: Results indicated that SK-HEP1 cells were more susceptible to DENV infection than MDDCs, and L-SIGN transfection significantly increased viral replication in SK-HEP1 cell lines. The study also found that L-SIGN-enhanced DENV infection is mediated by the decrease in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) but not interferon gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10). These findings reveal that L-SIGN-induced DENV infection leads to reduced MCP-1 levels, which, in turn, enhances DENV replication velocity. (4) Conclusions: This study offers insights into the molecular mechanisms of DENV replication and identifies potential therapeutic targets involving MCP-1 and L-SIGN pathways.

TI  - MCPIP1 ribonuclease exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral effects through viral RNA binding and degradation
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 41
SP  - 3314
EP  - 3326
AB  - Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1), belonging to the MCPIP family with highly conserved CCCH-type zinc finger and Nedd4-BP1, YacP Nuclease domains, has been implicated in negative regulation of the cellular inflammatory responses. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that this RNA-binding nuclease also targets viral RNA and possesses potent antiviral activities. Overexpression of the human MCPIP1, but not MCPIP2, MCPIP3 or MCPIP4, inhibited Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DEN) replication. The functional analysis of MCPIP1 revealed that the activities of RNase, RNA binding and oligomerization, but not deubiqutinase, are required for its antiviral potential. Furthermore, infection of other positive-sense RNA viruses, such as sindbis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus, and negative-sense RNA virus, such as influenza virus, as well as DNA virus, such as adenovirus, can also be blocked by MCPIP1. Moreover, the endogenous MCPIP1 gene expression was induced by JEV and DEN infection, and knockdown of MCPIP1 expression enhanced the replication of JEV and DEN in human cells. Thus, MCPIP1 can act as a host innate defense via RNase activity for targeting and degrading viral RNA.

TI  - MIP‐1α and MIP‐1β induction by dengue virus
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 65
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) infection can result in either a mild febrile illness known as dengue fever (DF) or a life‐threatening disease called dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). DHF is more prevalent in patients undergoing secondary DV infection. This observation has led to the hypothesis that DHF may be the result of immune reactions to the secondary DV infection; an event termed immunopathology. Two cellular factors, MIP‐1α and MIP‐1β, have been found to be induced by infection with DV. MIP‐1 induction by DV infection was observed in a myelomonocytic cell line, as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a dengue naive donor. MIP‐1 induction was not due to factors secreted by infected cells. In fact, replication‐competent virus was required to induce MIP‐1. Evidence is also provided that MIP‐1 genes are expressed in patients with dengue disease. It is hypothesized that these chemokines may have roles in the immunopathology of dengue infections and may contribute to fever and bone marrow suppression observed in patients with DV infections. J.

TI  - MITD1 is a brain-specific interferon-inducible factor that inhibits flavivirus replication
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 122
AB  - Significance Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are emerging worldwide, posing a major threat to public health. In this work, we have identified an antiviral protein, named MITD1, which is able to block flavivirus replication in human cells. Specifically, MITD1 was found to prevent the formation of viral replication factories that flaviviruses establish within target cells. Strikingly, the expression of MITD1 is specifically induced in microglial cells, the main immune cells of the central nervous system, and prevents their infection. Given that most pathogenic flaviviruses can infect the brain and cause severe neurological disease, our data provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiopathology of neurotropic flavivirus infections.

TI  - Macrophage migration inhibitory factor is critical for dengue NS1-induced endothelial glycocalyx degradation and hyperpermeability
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - Vascular leakage is one of the salient characteristics of severe dengue. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of dengue virus (DENV) can stimulate endothelial cells to secrete endothelial hyperpermeability factor, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and the glycocalyx degradation factor heparanase 1 (HPA-1). However, it is unclear whether MIF is directly involved in NS1-induced glycocalyx degradation. In this study, we observed that among NS1, MIF and glycocalyx degradation-related molecules, the HPA-1, metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and syndecan 1 (CD138) serum levels were all increased in dengue patients, and only NS1 and MIF showed a positive correlation with the CD138 level in severe patients. To further characterize and clarify the relationship between MIF and CD138, we used recombinant NS1 to stimulate human cells in vitro and challenge mice in vivo. Our tabulated results suggested that NS1 stimulation could induce human endothelial cells to secrete HPA-1 and immune cells to secrete MMP-9, resulting in endothelial glycocalyx degradation and hyperpermeability. Moreover, HPA-1, MMP-9, and CD138 secretion after NS1 stimulation was blocked by MIF inhibitors or antibodies both in vitro and in mice. Taken together, these results suggest that MIF directly engages in dengue NS1-induced glycocalyx degradation and that targeting MIF may represent a possible therapeutic approach for preventing dengue-induced vascular leakage.

TI  - Magnesium Regulates RNA Ring Dynamics and Folding in Subgenomic Flaviviral RNA.
JF  - The journal of physical chemistry. B
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses including dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and regional encephalitis produce a large amount of short subgenomic flaviviral RNAs during infection. A segment of these RNAs named as xrRNA1 features a multi-pseudoknot (PK)-associated structure, which resists the host cell enzyme (XRN1) from degrading the viral RNA. We investigate how this long-range RNA PK folds in the presence of counterions, specifically in a mix of monovalent (K+) and divalent (Mg2+) salts at physiological concentrations. In this study, we use extensive explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize the RNA ion environment of the folded RNA conformation, as determined by the crystal structure. This allowed us to identify the precise locations of various coordinated RNA-Mg2+ interactions, including inner-sphere/chelated and outer-sphere coordinated Mg2+. Given that RNA folding involves large-scale conformational changes, making it challenging to explore through classical MD simulations, we investigate the folding mechanism of xrRNA1 using an all-atom structure-based RNA model with a hybrid implicit-explicit treatment of the ion environment via the dynamic counterion condensation model, both with and without physiological Mg2+ concentration. The study reveals potential folding pathways for this xrRNA1, which is consistent with the results obtained from optical tweezer experiments. The equilibrium and free energy simulations both capture a dynamic equilibrium between the ring-open and ring-close states of the RNA, driven by a long-range PK interaction. Free energy calculations reveal that with the addition of Mg2+ ions, the equilibrium shifts more toward the ring-close state. A detailed analysis of the free energy pathways and ion-mediated contact probability map highlights the critical role of Mg2+ in bridging G50 and A33. This Mg2+-mediated connection helps form the long-range PK which in turn controls the transition between the ring-open and ring-close states. The study underscores the critical role of Mg2+ in the RNA folding transition, highlighting specific locations of Mg2+ contributing to the stabilization of long-range PK connections likely to enhance the robustness of Xrn1 resistance of flaviviral xrRNAs.

TI  - Maintenance of Dimer Conformation by the Dengue Virus Core Protein α4-α4′ Helix Pair Is Critical for Nucleocapsid Formation and Virus Production
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 7998
EP  - 8015
AB  - ABSTRACT The virion of dengue virus (DENV) is composed of a viral envelope covering a nucleocapsid formed by a complex of viral genomic RNA and core protein (CP). DENV CP forms a dimer via the internal α2 and α4 helices of each monomer. Pairing of α2-α2′ creates a continuous hydrophobic surface, while the α4-α4′ helix pair joins the homodimer via side-chain interactions of the inner-edge residues. However, the importance of dimer conformation and the α4 helix of DENV CP in relation to its function are poorly understood. Loss of association between CP and lipid droplets (LDs) due to mutation suggests that the CP hydrophobic surface was not exposed, offering a possible explanation for the absence of dimers. Further assays suggest the connection between CP folding and protein stability. Attenuation of full-length RNA-derived virus production is associated with CP mutation, since no significant defects were detected in virus translation and replication. The in vitro characterization assays further highlighted that the α4-α4′ helix pair conformation is critical in preserving the overall α-helical content, thermostability, and dimer formation ability of CP, features correlated with the efficiency of nucleocapsid formation. Addition of Tween 20 improves in vitro nucleocapsid-like particle formation, suggesting the role of the LD in nucleocapsid formation in vivo. This study provides the first direct link between the α4-α4′ helix pair interaction and the CP dimer conformation that is the basis of CP function, particularly in nucleocapsid formation during virion production. IMPORTANCE Structure-based mutagenesis study of the dengue virus core protein (CP) reveals that the α4-α4′ helix pair is the key to maintaining its dimer conformation, which is the basis of CP function in nucleocapsid formation and virus production. Attenuation of full-length RNA-derived virus production is associated with CP mutation, since no significant defects in virus translation and replication were detected. In vitro inefficiency and size of nucleocapsid-like particle (NLP) formation offer a possible explanation for in vivo virus production inefficiency upon CP mutation. Further, the transition of NLP morphology from an incomplete state to an intact particle shown by α4-α4′ helix pair mutants in the presence of a nonionic detergent suggests the regulatory role of the intracellular lipid droplet (LD) in CP-LD interaction and in promoting nucleocapsid formation. This study provides the first direct link between the α4-α4′ helix pair interaction and CP dimer conformation that is the fundamental requirement of CP function, particularly in nucleocapsid formation during virion production.

TI  - Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I Chain-Related A and B (MICA and MICB) Gene, Allele, and Haplotype Associations With Dengue Infections in Ethnic Thais.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
AB  - BACKGROUND
Major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related (MIC) A and B (MICA and MICB) are polymorphic stress molecules recognized by natural killer cells. This study was performed to analyze MIC gene profiles in hospitalized Thai children with acute dengue illness.


METHODS
MIC allele profiles were determined in a discovery cohort of patients with dengue fever or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (n = 166) and controls (n = 149). A replication cohort of patients with dengue (n = 222) was used to confirm specific MICB associations with disease.


RESULTS
MICA*045 and MICB*004 associated with susceptibility to DHF in secondary dengue virus (DENV) infections (odds ratio [OR], 3.22; [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-8.84] and 1.99 [1.07-2.13], respectively), and MICB*002 with protection from DHF in secondary DENV infections (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, .21-.68). The protective effect of MICB*002 against secondary DHF was confirmed in the replication cohort (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, .22-.82) and was stronger when MICB*002 is present in individuals also carrying HLA-B*18, B*40, and B*44 alleles which form the B44 supertype of functionally related alleles (0.29, 95% CI, .14-.60).


CONCLUSIONS
Given that MICB*002 is a low expresser of soluble proteins, these data indicate that surface expression of MICB*002 with B44 supertype alleles on DENV-infected cells confer a protective advantage in controlling DENV infection using natural killer cells.

TI  - Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever: A Meta-Analysis of Human Leukocyte Antigens A*24 and B*44
JF  - Cureus
VL  - 14
AB  - Introduction: Dengue fever (DF) is a disease caused by dengue virus (DENV) from the family Flaviviridae. The role of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) in dengue fever (DF) and its more severe manifestation, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), has been a topic of great research interest. In addition to HLA profile, race, age, DENV serotype, infection while having certain chronic diseases, and secondary infection are risk factors for DHF susceptibility. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus infection is a mechanism for DHF infection. Individual studies have examined the effects of HLA-A*24 and HLA-B*44 presence on DHF, but none have analyzed these in a meta-analysis. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of HLA-A*24 and HLA-B*44 presence on DHF and DF susceptibility. Materials and methods: A meta-analysis on DHF and DF susceptibility in patients with HLA-A*24 and HLA-B*44 was conducted. Google Scholar was used to find studies that contained patients with HLA-A*24 or HLA-B*44 that were diagnosed with DHF or DF. Studies containing patients diagnosed using the 1997 WHO guidelines and possessing HLA-A*24 or HLA-B*44 that were diagnosed with DHF or DF, including primary or secondary infection, and studies measuring odds ratios (ORs) were included. Patients diagnosed using the 2009 WHO guidelines and studies in a foreign language, using animals, or lacking odds ratios were excluded. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) quality assessment of the case-control study tool was used, and a Doi plot was generated using MetaXL to assess for risk of bias. Review Manager version 5.4 was used to generate odds ratios and forest plots with subgroup analysis from allele and phenotype frequency data. Ten studies from 2001 to 2015 met the inclusion criteria. The studies included 2837 DHF/DF patients and 4880 healthy control (HC) patients. Results: HLA-A*24 was associated with a 1.39 times susceptibility to DHF while those possessing HLA-B*44 were 0.62 times susceptible to DHF (OR=1.39 and 95% CI=1.17-1.66; OR=0.62 and 95% CI=0.39-0.99). Neither HLA-A*24 nor HLA-B*44 presence was associated with DF susceptibility (OR=1.04 and 95% CI=0.82-1.33; OR=0.88 and 95% CI=0.68-1.14). Conclusion: These results indicate that two different major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I alleles, HLA-A*24 and HLA-B*44, have opposing effects on DHF susceptibility but none on DF susceptibility. The study's specificity is limited in that it examines HLA allele groups and not specific HLA proteins. The results of this study can be used clinically to identify patients that may be at a higher risk of developing DHF based on their HLA profile.

TI  - Mapping Protein Interactions between Dengue Virus and Its Human and Insect Hosts
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 5
AB  - Background Dengue fever is an increasingly significant arthropod-borne viral disease, with at least 50 million cases per year worldwide. As with other viral pathogens, dengue virus is dependent on its host to perform the bulk of functions necessary for viral survival and replication. To be successful, dengue must manipulate host cell biological processes towards its own ends, while avoiding elimination by the immune system. Protein-protein interactions between the virus and its host are one avenue through which dengue can connect and exploit these host cellular pathways and processes. Methodology/Principal Findings We implemented a computational approach to predict interactions between Dengue virus (DENV) and both of its hosts, Homo sapiens and the insect vector Aedes aegypti. Our approach is based on structural similarity between DENV and host proteins and incorporates knowledge from the literature to further support a subset of the predictions. We predict over 4,000 interactions between DENV and humans, as well as 176 interactions between DENV and A. aegypti. Additional filtering based on shared Gene Ontology cellular component annotation reduced the number of predictions to approximately 2,000 for humans and 18 for A. aegypti. Of 19 experimentally validated interactions between DENV and humans extracted from the literature, this method was able to predict nearly half (9). Additional predictions suggest specific interactions between virus and host proteins relevant to interferon signaling, transcriptional regulation, stress, and the unfolded protein response. Conclusions/Significance Dengue virus manipulates cellular processes to its advantage through specific interactions with the host's protein interaction network. The interaction networks presented here provide a set of hypothesis for further experimental investigation into the DENV life cycle as well as potential therapeutic targets.

TI  - Mapping the Interactions between the NS4B and NS3 Proteins of Dengue Virus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 3471
EP  - 3483
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus RNA synthesis is mediated by a multiprotein complex associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, named the replication complex (RC). Within the flavivirus RC, NS4B, an integral membrane protein with a role in virulence and regulation of the innate immune response, binds to the NS3 protease-helicase. NS4B modulates the RNA helicase activity of NS3, but the molecular details of their interaction remain elusive. Here, we used dengue virus (DENV) to map the determinants for the NS3-NS4B interaction. Coimmunoprecipitation and an in situ proximity ligation assay confirmed that NS3 colocalizes with NS4B in both DENV-infected cells and cells coexpressing both proteins. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that subdomains 2 and 3 of the NS3 helicase region and the cytoplasmic loop of NS4B are required for binding. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we found that the isolated cytoplasmic loop of NS4B is flexible, with a tendency to form a three-turn α-helix and two short β-strands. Upon binding to the NS3 helicase, 12 amino acids within the cytoplasmic loop of NS4B exhibited line broadening, suggesting a participation in the interaction. Sequence alignment showed that 4 of these 12 residues are strictly conserved across different flaviviruses. Mutagenesis analysis showed that three (Q134, G140, and N144) of the four evolutionarily conserved NS4B residues are essential for DENV replication. The mapping of the NS3/NS4B-interacting regions described here can assist the design of inhibitors that disrupt their interface for antiviral therapy. IMPORTANCE NS3 and NS4B are essential components of the flavivirus RC. Using DENV as a model, we mapped the interaction between the viral NS3 and NS4B proteins. The subdomains 2 and 3 of NS3 helicase as well as the cytoplasmic loop of NS4B are critical for the interaction. Functional analysis delineated residues within the NS4B cytoplasmic loop that are crucial for DENV replication. Our findings reveal molecular details of how flavivirus NS3 protein cooperates with NS4B within the RC. In addition, this study has established the rationale and assays to search for inhibitors disrupting the NS3-NS4B interaction for antiviral drug discovery.

TI  - Mapping the Interactions of Dengue Virus NS1 Protein with Human Liver Proteins Using a Yeast Two-Hybrid System: Identification of C1q as an Interacting Partner
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue constitutes a global health concern. The clinical manifestation of this disease varies from mild febrile illness to severe hemorrhage and/or fatal hypovolemic shock. Flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a secreted glycoprotein that is displayed on the surface of infected cells but is absent in viral particles. NS1 accumulates at high levels in the plasma of dengue virus (DENV)-infected patients, and previous reports highlight its involvement in immune evasion, dengue severity, liver dysfunction and pathogenesis. In the present study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for DENV2 NS1-interacting partners using a human liver cDNA library. We identified fifty genes, including human complement component 1 (C1q), which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation, ELISA and immunofluorescence assays, revealing for the first time the direct binding of this protein to NS1. Furthermore, the majority of the identified genes encode proteins that are secreted into the plasma of patients, and most of these proteins are classified as acute-phase proteins (APPs), such as plasminogen, haptoglobin, hemopexin, α-2-HS-glycoprotein, retinol binding protein 4, transferrin, and C4. The results presented here confirm the direct interaction of DENV NS1 with a key protein of the complement system and suggest a role for this complement protein in the pathogenesis of DENV infection.

TI  - Mass Cytometry Analysis of the NK Cell Receptor–Ligand Repertoire Reveals Unique Differences between Dengue-Infected Children and Adults
JF  - ImmunoHorizons
VL  - 4
SP  - 634
EP  - 647
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a significant cause of morbidity in many regions of the world, with children at the greatest risk of developing severe dengue. NK cells, characterized by their ability to rapidly recognize and kill virally infected cells, are activated during acute DENV infection. However, their role in viral clearance versus pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Our goal was to profile the NK cell receptor–ligand repertoire to provide further insight into the function of NK cells during pediatric and adult DENV infection. We used mass cytometry to phenotype isolate NK cells and PBMCs from a cohort of DENV-infected children and adults. Using unsupervised clustering, we found that pediatric DENV infection leads to a decrease in total NK cell frequency with a reduction in the percentage of CD56dimCD38bright NK cells and an increase in the percentage of CD56dimperforinbright NK cells. No such changes were observed in adults. Next, we identified markers predictive of DENV infection using a differential state test. In adults, NK cell expression of activation markers, including CD69, perforin, and Fas-L, and myeloid cell expression of activating NK cell ligands, namely Fas, were predictive of infection. In contrast, increased NK cell expression of the maturation marker CD57 and myeloid cell expression of inhibitory ligands, such as HLA class I molecules, were predictive of pediatric DENV infection. These findings suggest that acute pediatric DENV infection may result in diminished NK cell activation, which could contribute to enhanced pathogenesis and disease severity.

TI  - Matrix Metalloproteinase 3 Promotes Cellular Anti-Dengue Virus Response via Interaction with Transcription Factor NFκB in Cell Nucleus
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), the causative agent of human Dengue hemorrhagic fever, is a mosquito-borne virus of immense global health importance. Characterization of cellular factors promoting or inhibiting DENV infection is important for understanding the mechanism of DENV infection. In this report, MMP3 (stromelysin-1), a secretory endopeptidase that degrades extracellular matrices, has been shown promoting cellular antiviral response against DENV infection. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western Blot showed that the expression of MMP3 was upregulated in DENV-infected RAW264.7 cells. The intracellular viral loads were significantly higher in MMP3 silenced cells compared with controls. The expression level of selective anti-viral cytokines were decreased in MMP3 siRNA treated cells, and the transcription factor activity of NFκB was significantly impaired upon MMP3 silencing during DENV infection. Further, we found that MMP3 moved to cell nucleus upon DENV infection and colocalized with NFκB P65 in nucleus. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis suggested that MMP3 directly interacted with NFκB in nucleus during DENV infection and the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain of MMP3 was required for the interaction. This study suggested a novel role of MMP3 in nucleus during viral infection and provided new evidence for MMPs in immunomodulation.

TI  - Matrix metalloproteinases in the pathogenesis of dengue viral disease: Involvement of immune system and newer therapeutic strategies
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 93
SP  - 4629
EP  - 4637
AB  - Globally, the burden due to dengue infection is increasing with a recent estimate of 96 million progressing to the disease every year. Dengue pathogenesis and the factors influencing it are not completely known. It is now widely speculated that there is an important role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the initiation and progression of dengue pathogenesis; however, their exact roles are not fully understood. Overactivation of matrix metalloproteinases may contribute to the severity of dengue pathogenesis. Cytokines and various other mediators of inflammation interact with the vascular endothelium and matrix metalloproteinases may be one of the components among them. Extensive plasma leakage into tissue spaces may result in a shock. It is evident in the literature that MMP2 and MMP9 increase in dengue patients is correlated with the severity of the disease; however, the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Activation of innate cells and adaptive immune cells which include, B and T cells, macrophages or monocytes and dendritic cells also contribute to the dengue pathology. Newer therapeutic strategies include microRNAs, such as miR‐134 (targets MMP3 and MMP1) and MicroRNA‐320d, (targets MMP/TIMP proteolytic system). The use of antibodies‐based therapeutics like (Andecaliximab; anti‐matrix metalloproteinase‐9 antibody) is also suggested against MMPs in dengue. In this review, we summarize some recent developments associated with the involvement of immune cells and their mediators associated with the matrix metalloproteinases mediated dengue pathogenesis. We highlight that, there is still very little knowledge about the MMPs in dengue pathogenesis which needs attention and extensive investigations.

AB  - The maturation of dengue virus (type 2, New Guinea B strain; abbreviated Den-2) in cultured mosquito C3/36 cells and Vero cells was studied by immunoelectron microscopy for the first 7 days after cells were infected, assays of the virus were done by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. Virus titers in both kinds of cells were highest on day 6. These cells were then observed with an electron microscope. Den-2 was round and measured about 50 nm in diameter. The virus matured mainly at the membranes of cytoplasmic vacuoles and vesicles, but a few budding viral particles were seen in the cell surface membrane. Immunogold labelling with rabbit antiserum against the E protein of Japanese encephalitis virus was used to locate specific antigens of the Den-2 envelope protein. The results showed that the E protein was in vacuoles, vesicles, and endoplasmic reticulum of the cells. In this study there were no differences between C6/36 cells and Vero cells infected with Den-2.

TI  - Mechanism and Significance of Cell Type-Dependent Neutralization of Flaviviruses
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 7210
EP  - 7220
AB  - ABSTRACT The production of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is a correlate of protection for many human vaccines, including currently licensed vaccines against flaviviruses. NAbs are typically measured using a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Despite its extensive use, parameters that impact the performance of the PRNT have not been investigated from a mechanistic perspective. The results of a recent phase IIb clinical trial of a tetravalent dengue virus (DENV) vaccine suggest that NAbs, as measured using a PRNT performed with Vero cells, do not correlate with protection. This surprising finding highlights the importance of understanding how well the PRNT captures the complexity of the NAb response to DENV. In this study, we demonstrated that the structural heterogeneity of flaviviruses arising from inefficient virion maturation impacts the results of neutralization assays in a cell type-dependent manner. Neutralization titers of several monoclonal antibodies were significantly reduced when assayed on Vero cells compared to Raji cells expressing DC-SIGNR. This pattern can be explained by differences in the efficiency with which partially mature flaviviruses attach to each cell type, rather than a differential capacity of antibody to block infection. Vero cells are poorly permissive to the fraction of virions that are most sensitive to neutralization. Analysis of sera from recipients of live-attenuated monovalent DENV vaccine candidates revealed a strong correlation between the sensitivity of serum antibodies to the maturation state of DENV and cell type-dependent patterns of neutralization. Cross-reactive patterns of neutralization may be underrepresented by the “gold-standard” PRNT that employs Vero cells. IMPORTANCE Cell type-dependent patterns of neutralization describe a differential capacity of antibodies to inhibit virus infection when assayed on multiple cellular substrates. In this study, we established a link between antibodies that neutralize infection in a cell type-dependent fashion and those sensitive to the maturation state of the flavivirus virion. We demonstrated that cell type-dependent neutralization reflects a differential capacity to measure neutralization of viruses that are incompletely mature. Partially mature virions that most efficiently bind maturation state-sensitive antibodies are poorly represented by assays typically used in support of flavivirus vaccine development. The selection of cellular substrate for neutralization assays may significantly impact evaluation of the neutralization potency of the polyclonal response. These data suggest that current assays do not adequately capture the full complexity of the neutralizing antibody response and may hinder the identification of correlates of protection following flavivirus vaccination.

TI  - Mechanism and structural diversity of exoribonuclease-resistant RNA structures in flaviviral RNAs
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 9
AB  - Flaviviruses such as Yellow fever, Dengue, West Nile, and Zika generate disease-linked viral noncoding RNAs called subgenomic flavivirus RNAs. Subgenomic flavivirus RNAs result when the 5′–3′ progression of cellular exoribonuclease Xrn1 is blocked by RNA elements called Xrn1-resistant RNAs located within the viral genome’s 3′-untranslated region that operate without protein co-factors. Here, we show that Xrn1-resistant RNAs can halt diverse exoribonucleases, revealing a mechanism in which they act as general mechanical blocks that ‘brace’ against an enzyme’s surface, presenting an unfolding problem that confounds further enzyme progression. Further, we directly demonstrate that Xrn1-resistant RNAs exist in a diverse set of flaviviruses, including some specific to insects or with no known arthropod vector. These Xrn1-resistant RNAs comprise two secondary structural classes that mirror previously reported phylogenic analysis. Our discoveries have implications for the evolution of exoribonuclease resistance, the use of Xrn1-resistant RNAs in synthetic biology, and the development of new therapies. Subgenomic flavivirus RNAs are generated by a host exoribonuclease and play an important role in virus replication and pathogenesis. Here, the authors show the mechanism by which subgenomic flavivirus RNAs are generated and identify two structurally distinct sfRNA classes in flaviviruses.

TI  - Mechanism of Immune Evasion in Mosquito-Borne Diseases
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - In recent decades, mosquito-borne illnesses have emerged as a major health burden in many tropical regions. These diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever, Zika virus infection, Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile virus infection, are transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes. These pathogens have been shown to interfere with the host’s immune system through adaptive and innate immune mechanisms, as well as the human circulatory system. Crucial immune checkpoints such as antigen presentation, T cell activation, differentiation, and proinflammatory response play a vital role in the host cell’s response to pathogenic infection. Furthermore, these immune evasions have the potential to stimulate the human immune system, resulting in other associated non-communicable diseases. This review aims to advance our understanding of mosquito-borne diseases and the immune evasion mechanisms by associated pathogens. Moreover, it highlights the adverse outcomes of mosquito-borne disease.

TI  - Mechanism of NS2B-Mediated Activation of NS3pro in Dengue Virus: Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Bioassays
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83
SP  - 1060
EP  - 1070
AB  - ABSTRACT The NS2B cofactor is critical for proteolytic activation of the flavivirus NS3 protease. To elucidate the mechanism involved in NS2B-mediated activation of NS3 protease, molecular dynamic simulation, principal component analysis, molecular docking, mutagenesis, and bioassay studies were carried out on both the dengue virus NS3pro and NS2B-NS3pro systems. The results revealed that the NS2B-NS3pro complex is more rigid than NS3pro alone due to its robust hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction networks within the complex. These potent networks lead to remodeling of the secondary and tertiary structures of the protease that facilitates cleavage sequence recognition and binding of substrates. The cofactor is also essential for proper domain motion that contributes to substrate binding. Hence, the NS2B cofactor plays a dual role in enzyme activation by facilitating the refolding of the NS3pro domain as well as being directly involved in substrate binding/interactions. Kinetic analyses indicated for the first time that Glu92 and Asp50 in NS2B and Gln27, Gln35, and Arg54 in NS3pro may provide secondary interaction points for substrate binding. These new insights on the mechanistic contributions of the NS2B cofactor to NS3 activation may be utilized to refine current computer-based search strategies to raise the quality of candidate molecules identified as potent inhibitors against flaviviruses.

TI  - Mechanism of autophagy induced by activation of the AMPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway after TRIM22-mediated DENV-2 infection of HUVECs
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 19
AB  - Background Dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) was used to infect primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to examine autophagy induced by activation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway following tripartite motif-containing 22 (TRIM22)-mediated DENV-2 infection to further reveal the underlying pathogenic mechanism of DENV-2 infection. Methods Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to screen putative interference targets of TRIM22 and determine the knockdown efficiency. The effect of TRIM22 knockdown on HUVEC proliferation was determined using the CCK8 assay. Following TRIM22 knockdown, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine the ultrastructure of HUVEC autophagosomes and expression of HUVEC autophagy and AMPK pathway-related genes were measured by qRT-PCR. Moreover, HUVEC autophagy and AMPK pathway-related protein expression levels were determined by western blot analysis. Cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM) and the autophagosome structure of the HUVECs was observed by TEM. Results Western blot results indicated that TRIM22 protein expression levels increased significantly 36 h after DENV-2 infection, which was consistent with the proteomics prediction. The CCK8 assay revealed that HUVEC proliferation was reduced following TRIM22 knockdown ( P  < 0.001). The TEM results indicated that HUVEC autolysosomes increased and autophagy was inhibited after TRIM22 knockdown. The qRT-PCR results revealed that after TRIM22 knockdown, the expression levels of antithymocyte globulin 7 (ATG7), antithymocyte globulin 5 (ATG5), Beclin1, ERK, and mTOR genes decreased ( P  < 0.01); however, the expression of AMPK genes ( P  < 0.05) and P62 genes ( P  < 0.001) increased. FCM revealed that following TRIM22 knockdown, the percentage of HUVECs in the G2 phase increased ( P  < 0.001) along with cell apoptosis. The effect of TRIM22 overexpression on HUVEC autophagy induced by DENV-2 infection and AMPK pathways decreased after adding an autophagy inhibitor. Conclusions In HUVECs, TRIM22 protein positively regulates autophagy and may affect autophagy through the AMPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway. Autophagy is induced by activation of the AMPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway following TRIM22-mediated DENV-2 infection of HUVECs.

TI  - Mechanisms of Antiviral Activity of Iminosugars Against Dengue Virus
JF  - Dengue and Zika: Control and Antiviral Treatment Strategies
VL  - 1062
SP  - 277
EP  - 301
AB  - The antiviral mechanism of action of iminosugars against many enveloped viruses, including dengue virus (DENV), HIV, influenza and hepatitis C virus, is believed to be mediated by inducing misfolding of viral N-linked glycoproteins through inhibition of host endoplasmic reticulum-resident α-glucosidase enzymes. This leads to reduced secretion and/or infectivity of virions and hence lower viral titres, both in vitro and in vivo. Free oligosaccharide analysis from iminosugar-treated cells shows that antiviral activity correlates with production of mono- and tri-glucosylated sugars, indicative of inhibition of ER α-glucosidases. We demonstrate that glucose-mimicking iminosugars inhibit isolated glycoprotein and glycolipid processing enzymes and that this inhibition also occurs in primary cells treated with these drugs. Galactose-mimicking iminosugars that have been tested do not inhibit glycoprotein processing but do inhibit glycolipid processing, and are not antiviral against DENV. By comparison, the antiviral activity of glucose-mimetic iminosugars that inhibit endoplasmic reticulum-resident α-glucosidases, but not glycolipid processing, demonstrates that inhibition of α-glucosidases is responsible for iminosugar antiviral activity against DENV. This monograph will review the investigations of many researchers into the mechanisms of action of iminosugars and the contribution of our current understanding of these mechanisms for optimising clinical delivery of iminosugars. The effects of iminosugars on enzymes other than glucosidases, the induction of ER stress and viral receptors will be also put into context. Data suggest that inhibition of α-glucosidases results in inhibited release of virus and is the primary antiviral mechanism of action of iminosugars against DENV.

EP  - 70
AB  - The mechanistic mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a crucial role in response to many major cellular processes, including cellular metabolism, proliferation, and autophagy. Both mTOR and autophagy are suggested to be involved in the viral infection. However, little is known about the role of mTOR and autophagy in human endothelial cell infected with dengue virus-2 (DENV-2), this study is to investigate the role of mTOR and autophagy in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) infected with DENV-2 and related regulatory mechanisms. HUVECs were cultured in epithelial cell medium. A series of experiments involving immunohistochemistry, TCID50 method, real-time PCR, western blot, and laser confocal were performed in this study. The cell line was identified as HUVEC by the expression of cell factor VIII. The expression level of DENV-2 mRNA increased and showed an upward trend. Compared with the control group, the fluorescence of autophagy-labeled protein LC3B and lysosome-labeled protein lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in the cytoplasm of HUVEC induced by rapamycin was observed, and intensity was significantly enhanced under confocal laser scanning microscope, after fluorescence synthesis, the fluorescence of autophagy-labeled protein LC3B and lysosome-labeled protein LAMP1 overlaps were reduced. The intensity of fluorescence of autophagy-labeled protein LC3B and lysosome-labeled protein LAMP1 increased in 1 × 104 TCID50 DENV-2 infection group, after fluorescence synthesis, fluorescence of autophagy-labeled protein LC3B, lysosome-labeled protein LAMP1, and DEN2 NS1 overlapped. Compared with the control group, the phosphorylation level of mTOR, Atg13, and p-ULK1 in DENV-2-infected group or Rapa treatment group decreased significantly (p < 0.05), and the level of LC3-II increased significantly (p < 0.05). These results suggest that DENV-2 induces autophagy in HUVECs through mTOR signaling molecule.

TI  - Mediators of vascular leak in dengue infections
JF  - Journal of the Ceylon College of Physicians
VL  - 46
SP  - 7
EP  - 
AB  - Although plasma leakage is the hallmark of severe dengue infections the factors that cause increased vascular permeability have not been identified. As platelet activating factor (PAF), lipid mediators and cytokines are associated with increase in vascular permeability, we set out to investigate the role of these mediators in acute dengue infection. Levels of inflammatory lipid mediators and cytokines were initially evaluated in 25 patients with confirmed acute dengue infection and 12 healthy individuals. After determining which inflammatory mediators were associated with severe dengue, serial assays of the above lipid mediators, and cytokines were done in an additional 36 patients in serum samples collected 12 hours apart throughout the course of their hospital stay. We found that PAF levels were significantly higher in patients (p=0.001) when compared to healthy individuals and that PAF levels rose just before the onset of the critical phase. PAF values of >100ng/ml were associated with reduced expression of gap junction proteins leading to increased vascular permeability. A similar effect was seen with serum from patients with dengue infection which was reversed by a PAF receptor antagonist. S1P levels which are associated with increasing the integrity of the endothelial barrier were significantly reduced in patients with DHF. Serum IL-10, TNFα and IL-1β levels were elevated in patients with DHF and followed the same patterns as PAF. In conclusion, our results show that PAF is likely to be a potent mediator of vascular leak in dengue and use of PAF blockers could be therapeutically useful.

TI  - Megakaryopoiesis in Dengue virus infected K562 cell promotes viral replication which inhibits endomitosis and accumulation of ROS associated with differentiation
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - In the human host blood Monocytes and bone marrow Megakaryocytes are implicated as major sites supporting high replication. The human K562 cell line supports DENV replication and represent Megakaryocyte-Erythrocyte progenitors (MEP), replicating features of in vivo Megakaryopoiesis upon stimulation with Phorbol esters. In this article, we report results that indicate the mutual influence of Megakaryopoiesis and DENV replication on each other, through comparison of PMA-induced differentiation of either mock-infected or DENV-infected K562 cells. We present data showing PMA-induced differentiation to drastically increase DENV replication and a concomitant augmented secretion of infectious virus. Although the mechanism is not clear yet, we show that it is not through an increased uptake of virus by differentiated cells. On the other hand, DENV replication in cells undergoing PMA-induced differentiation, interferes with major differentiation markers of Megakaryopoiesis including activation of ERK1/2 MAP Kinase, endomitosis and surface expression of platelet-specific proteins without any drastic effect on cell death. Among signaling intermediaries of the JAK-STAT pathway, we observed infection associated degradation of SOC3 protein similar to earlier observations with STAT2. DENV infection leads to accumulation of Reactive-oxygen species (ROS) in different cells including K562. PMA-induced differentiation of uninfected K562 cells also leads to intracellular ROS accumulation. Interestingly, we observed ROS accumulation to be suppressed by concomitant DENV replication in K562 cells undergoing PMA-induced differentiation. This is the first report of a model system where DENV replication suppresses intracellular ROS accumulation. The implications of these results for Megakaryopoiesis and viral replication would be discussed.

TI  - Melatonin Inhibits Dengue Virus Infection via the Sirtuin 1-Mediated Interferon Pathway
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative pathogen in the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. DENV is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. Approximately 100 million people are infected annually worldwide, and most of those live in tropical and subtropical areas. There is still no effective drug or vaccine for treatment of DENV infection. In this study, we set forth to investigate the effect of melatonin, which is a natural hormone with multiple pharmacological functions, against DENV infection. Treatment with subtoxic doses of melatonin dose-dependently inhibited DENV production. Cross-protection across serotypes and various cell types was also observed. Time-of-addition assay suggested that melatonin exerts its influence during the post-entry step of viral infection. The antiviral activity of melatonin partly originates from activation of the sirtuin pathway since co-treatment with melatonin and the sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) inhibitor reversed the effect of melatonin treatment alone. Moreover, melatonin could modulate the transcription of antiviral genes that aid in suppression of DENV production. This antiviral mechanism of melatonin suggests a possible new strategy for treating DENV infection.

VL  - 118

EP  - 10155
AB  - The Dengue virus (DENV) NS2A protein, essential for viral replication, is a poorly characterized membrane protein. NS2A displays both protein/protein and membrane/protein interactions, yet neither its functions in the viral cycle nor its active regions are known with certainty. To highlight the different membrane-active regions of NS2A, we characterized the effects of peptides derived from a peptide library encompassing this protein’s full length on different membranes by measuring their membrane leakage induction and modulation of lipid phase behavior. Following this initial screening, one region, peptide dens25, had interesting effects on membranes; therefore, we sought to thoroughly characterize this region’s interaction with membranes. This peptide presents an interfacial/hydrophobic pattern characteristic of a membrane-proximal segment. We show that dens25 strongly interacts with membranes that contain a large proportion of lipid molecules with a formal negative charge, and that this effect has a major electrostatic contribution. Considering its membrane modulating capabilities, this region might be involved in membrane rearrangements and thus be important for the viral cycle.

TI  - Membrane Topology and Function of Dengue Virus NS2A Protein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 4609
EP  - 4622
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus nonstructural protein 2A (NS2A) is a component of the viral replication complex that functions in virion assembly and antagonizes the host immune response. Although flavivirus NS2A is known to associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, the detailed topology of this protein has not been determined. Here we report the first topology model of flavivirus NS2A on the ER membrane. Using dengue virus (DENV) NS2A as a model, we show that (i) the N-terminal 68 amino acids are located in the ER lumen, with one segment (amino acids 30 to 52) that interacts with ER membrane without traversing the lipid bilayer; (ii) amino acids 69 to 209 form five transmembrane segments, each of which integrally spans the ER membrane; and (iii) the C-terminal tail (amino acids 210 to 218) is located in the cytosol. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structural analysis showed that the first membrane-spanning segment (amino acids 69 to 93) consists of two helices separated by a “helix breaker.” The helix breaker is formed by amino acid P85 and one positively charged residue, R84. Functional analysis using replicon and genome-length RNAs of DENV-2 indicates that P85 is not important for viral replication. However, when R84 was replaced with E, the mutation attenuated both viral RNA synthesis and virus production. Remarkably, an R84A mutation did not affect viral RNA synthesis but blocked intracellular formation of infectious virions. Collectively, the mutagenesis results demonstrate that NS2A functions in both DENV RNA synthesis and virion assembly/maturation. The topology model of DENV NS2A provides a good starting point for studying how flavivirus NS2A modulates viral replication and evasion of host immune response.

TI  - Membrane undulation induced by NS4A of Dengue virus: a molecular dynamics simulation study
JF  - Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics
VL  - 32
SP  - 1552
EP  - 1562
AB  - Nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) of Dengue virus (DENV) is a membrane protein involved in rearrangements of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane that are required for formation of replication vesicles. NS4A is composed most likely of three membrane domains. The N- and C-terminal domains are supposed to traverse the lipid membrane whereas the central one is thought to reside on the membrane surface, thus forming a u-shaped protein. All three membrane domains are proposed to be helical by secondary structure prediction programs. After performing multi nanosecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at various temperatures (300, 310, and 315.15 K) with each of the individual domains, they are used in a docking approach to define putative association motifs of the transmembrane domains (TMDs). Two structures of the u-shaped protein are generated by separating two assembled TMDs linking them with the membrane-attached domain. Lipid undulation is monitored with the structures embedded in a fully hydrated lipid bilayer applying multiple 200 ns MD simulations at 310 K. An intact structure of the protein supports membrane undulation. The strong unwinding of the helices in the domain-linking section of one of the structures lowers its capability to induce membrane curvature. Unwinding of the link region is due to interactions of two tryptophan residues, Trp-96 and 104. These results provide first insights into the membrane-altering properties of DENV NS4A.

TI  - Membrane-Associated Flavivirus Replication Complex—Its Organization and Regulation
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Flavivirus consists of a large number of arthropod-borne viruses, many of which cause life-threatening diseases in humans. A characteristic feature of flavivirus infection is to induce the rearrangement of intracellular membrane structure in the cytoplasm. This unique membranous structure called replication organelle is considered as a microenvironment that provides factors required for the activity of the flaviviral replication complex. The replication organelle serves as a place to coordinate viral RNA amplification, protein translation, and virion assembly and also to protect the viral replication complex from the cellular immune defense system. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of how the formation and function of membrane-associated flaviviral replication organelle are regulated by cellular factors.

JF  - Biochemistry
VL  - 53 32
SP  - 5280
EP  - 9
AB  - The Dengue virus (DENV) prM protein consists of two moieties, the pr and M domains. Apart from preventing the premature fusion activity of the DENV E protein, prM has several other unknown biological roles, displaying both protein-protein and membrane-protein interactions. Although the prM protein is an essential component of the DENV viral cycle, little is known about its biological functions and what regions of this protein are responsible for said functions. By performing an exhaustive study of membrane rupture induced by a prM peptide library on simple and complex model membranes as well as their ability to modulate the phospholipid phase transitions of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-glycerol], we identified six membranotropic regions on the prM protein. Apart from the previously identified two transmembrane segments of the protein, one of these regions probably interacts with the fusion E protein and another one, the stem segment, would interact with the membrane modulating its structure. These data will help us understand the molecular mechanism of viral entry and morphogenesis, allow the identification of new targets for the treatment of Dengue virus infection, and make possible the future development of DENV entry inhibitors.

TI  - Meta-Analysis of Dengue Severity during Infection by Different Dengue Virus Serotypes in Primary and Secondary Infections
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 11
AB  - Introduction Dengue virus (DENV) infection is currently a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world; it has become more common and virulent over the past half-century and has gained much attention. Thus, this review compared the percentage of severe cases of both primary and secondary infections with different serotypes of dengue virus. Methods Data related to the number of cases involving dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock syndrome (DSS) or severe dengue infections caused by different serotypes of dengue virus were obtained by using the SCOPUS, the PUBMED and the OVID search engines with the keywords “(dengue* OR dengue virus*) AND (severe dengue* OR severity of illness index* OR severity* OR DF* OR DHF* OR DSS*) AND (serotypes* OR serogroup*)”, according to the MESH terms suggested by PUBMED and OVID. Results Approximately 31 studies encompassing 15,741 cases reporting on the dengue serotypes together with their severity were obtained, and meta-analysis was carried out to analyze the data. This study found that DENV-3 from the Southeast Asia (SEA) region displayed the greatest percentage of severe cases in primary infection (95% confidence interval (CI), 31.22–53.67, 9 studies, n = 598, I2 = 71.53%), whereas DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 from the SEA region, as well as DENV-2 and DENV-3 from non-SEA regions, exhibited the greatest percentage of severe cases in secondary infection (95% CI, 11.64–80.89, 4–14 studies, n = 668–3,149, I2 = 14.77–96.20%). Moreover, DENV-2 and DENV-4 from the SEA region had been found to be more highly associated with dengue shock syndrome (DSS) (95% CI, 10.47–40.24, 5–8 studies, n = 642–2,530, I2 = 76.93–97.70%), while DENV-3 and DENV-4 from the SEA region were found to be more highly associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (95% CI, 31.86–54.58, 9 studies, n = 674–2,278, I2 = 55.74–88.47%), according to the 1997 WHO dengue classification. Finally, DENV-2 and DENV-4 from the SEA region were discovered to be more highly associated with secondary infection compared to other serotypes (95% CI, 72.01–96.32, 9–12 studies, n = 671–2,863, I2 = 25.01–96.75%). Conclusion This study provides evidence that the presence of certain serotypes, including primary infection with DENV-3 from the SEA region and secondary infection with DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 also from the SEA region, as well as DENV-2 and DENV-3 from non SEA regions, increased the risk of severe dengue infections. Thus, these serotypes are worthy of special consideration when making clinical predictions upon the severity of the infection.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: This study determined whether tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10) polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to dengue. Methods: a systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted of the associations between the TNF-α (−308G/A) and IL-10 (−819C/T) polymorphisms and dengue. Results: A total of eight case-controls studies involving 384 individuals with symptomatic dengue, 571 individuals with dengue hemorrhagic fever, and 995 healthy controls were considered in the meta-analysis. There was no significant association between TNF-α (−308G/A) and IL-10 (−819C/T) polymorphism and dengue in overall population. However, stratifying meta-analysis by groups, the meta-analysis revealed association between the TNF-α −308 G/G (OR: 1.62, CI: 1.02–2.57, p = 0.04) genotype and allele G (OR: 1.62, CI: 1.04–2.55, p = 0.03) that confers susceptibility to symptomatic dengue, while the TNF-α −308 G/A genotype (OR: 0.69, CI = 0.39–0.99, p = 0.04) and allele A (OR: 0.64, CI: 0.41–1.00, p = 0.05) confers protection to symptomatic dengue. No difference was observed for the TNF-α (−308) and IL-10 (−819C/T) polymorphisms in the comparisons of hemorrhagic dengue versus control and hemorrhagic dengue versus symptomatic dengue. Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that TNF-α (−308) polymorphism is associated with dengue symptomatic susceptibility.

TI  - Metabolic Dependency Shapes Bivalent Antiviral Response in Host Cells in Response to Poly:IC: The Role of Glutamine
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - The establishment of effective antiviral responses within host cells is intricately related to their metabolic status, shedding light on immunometabolism. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that cellular reliance on glutamine metabolism contributes to the development of a potent antiviral response. We evaluated the antiviral response in the presence or absence of L-glutamine in the culture medium, revealing a bivalent response hinging on cellular metabolism. While certain interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) exhibited higher expression in an oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-dependent manner, others were surprisingly upregulated in a glycolytic-dependent manner. This metabolic dichotomy was influenced in part by variations in IFN-β expression. We initially demonstrated that the presence of L-glutamine induced an enhancement of OXPHOS in A549 cells. Furthermore, in cells either stimulated poly:IC or infected with Dengue Virus and Zika Virus, a marked increase in ISGs expression was observed in a dose-dependent manner with L-glutamine supplementation. Interestingly, our findings unveiled a metabolic dependency in the expression of specific ISGs. In particular, genes such as ISG54, ISG12 and ISG15 exhibited heightened expression in cells cultured with L-glutamine, corresponding to higher OXPHOS rates and IFN-β signaling. Conversely, the expression of viperin and 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 was inversely related to L-glutamine concentration, suggesting a glycolysis-dependent regulation, confirmed by inhibition experiments. This study highlights the intricate interplay between cellular metabolism, especially glutaminergic and glycolytic, and the establishment of the canonical antiviral response characterized by the expression of antiviral effectors, potentially paving the way for novel strategies to modulate antiviral responses through metabolic interventions.

TI  - Metabolic response to CNS infection with flaviviruses
JF  - Journal of Neuroinflammation
VL  - 20
AB  - Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne RNA viruses found worldwide that, when introduced into the human body, cause diseases, including neuroinfections, that can lead to serious metabolic consequences and even death. Some of the diseases caused by flaviviruses occur continuously in certain regions, while others occur intermittently or sporadically, causing epidemics. Some of the most common flaviviruses are West Nile virus, dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus. Since all the above-mentioned viruses are capable of penetrating the blood–brain barrier through different mechanisms, their actions also affect the central nervous system (CNS). Like other viruses, flaviviruses, after entering the human body, contribute to redox imbalance and, consequently, to oxidative stress, which promotes inflammation in skin cells, in the blood and in CNS. This review focuses on discussing the effects of oxidative stress and inflammation resulting from pathogen invasion on the metabolic antiviral response of the host, and the ability of viruses to evade the consequences of metabolic changes or exploit them for increased replication and further progression of infection, which affects the development of sequelae and difficulties in therapy.

TI  - Metabolomic Insights into Human Arboviral Infections: Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - The global burden of arboviral diseases and the limited success in controlling them calls for innovative methods to understand arbovirus infections. Metabolomics has been applied to detect alterations in host physiology during infection. This approach relies on mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to evaluate how perturbations in biological systems alter metabolic pathways, allowing for differentiation of closely related conditions. Because viruses heavily depend on host resources and pathways, they present unique challenges for characterizing metabolic changes. Here, we review the literature on metabolomics of arboviruses and focus on the interpretation of identified molecular features. Metabolomics has revealed biomarkers that differentiate disease states and outcomes, and has shown similarities in metabolic alterations caused by different viruses (e.g., lipid metabolism). Researchers investigating such metabolomic alterations aim to better understand host–virus dynamics, identify diagnostically useful molecular features, discern perturbed pathways for therapeutics, and guide further biochemical research. This review focuses on lessons derived from metabolomics studies on samples from arbovirus-infected humans.

TI  - Metabolomics applied in the study of emerging arboviruses caused by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes: A review
JF  - ELECTROPHORESIS
VL  - 41
AB  - Arboviruses, such as chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, and zika, caused by the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, have been a frequent public health problem, with a high incidence of outbreaks in tropical and subtropical countries. These diseases are easily confused with a flu‐like illness and present very similar symptoms, difficult to distinguish, and treat appropriately. The effects that these infections cause in the organism are fundamentally derived from complex metabolic processes. A prominent area of science that investigates the changes in the metabolism of complex organisms is the metabolomics. Metabolomics measures the metabolites produced or altered in biological organisms, through the use of robust analytical platforms, such as separation techniques hyphenated with mass spectrometry, combined with bioinformatics. This review article presents an overview of the basic concepts of metabolomics workflow and advances in this field, and compiles research articles that use this omic approach to study these arboviruses. In this context, the metabolomics is applied to search new therapies, understand the viral replication mechanisms, and access the host‐virus interactions.

JF  - Journal of proteome research
VL  - 9 12
SP  - 6523
EP  - 34
AB  - This paper describes a multiplatform analytical approach combining proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS), together with pattern recognition tools in a metabolomic study used to investigate the effects of dengue virus infection. The four serotypes of dengue, DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4, were inoculated into the EA.hy926 cell line, which was then incubated for various time intervals. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the (1)H NMR and MS data revealed metabolic profile patterns or fingerprint patterns that can be attributed to specific virus serotypes. Distinct effects of infection by each serotype were demonstrated, and these differences were attributed to changes in levels of metabolites (including amino acids, dicarboxylic acids, fatty acids, and organic acids related to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle). The study demonstrated application of metabolomics to improve understanding of the effect of dengue infection on endothelial cells' metabolome.

TI  - Metagenome Sequencing Reveals the Microbiome of Aedes albopictus and Its Possible Relationship With Dengue Virus Susceptibility
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue fever virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses a serious risk to human health. Aedes albopictus is a widely distributed vector of dengue fever in China. Based on the impact of physiological activity, the microbiome in A. albopictus will provide a novel environment-friendly approach to control DENV transmission. We performed metagenomic sequencing on A. albopictus before and after exposure to DENV blood meal to detect microbiome variation of A. albopictus with different susceptibilities to DENV. The dominant phyla in A. albopictus microbiome were Proteobacteria and Ascomycota, and the dominant genera were Aspergillus and Metarhizium. Gammaproteobacteria bacterium, Lactobacillus harbinensis, and Neurospora crassa differed significantly after DENV infection. There were 15 different microorganisms found to be involved in mosquito immunity and metabolism, such as Alphaproteobacteria bacterium, Methyloglobulus morosus, and Shigella sonnei, which might have an impact on the DENV susceptibility of A. albopictus. It was hypothesized that the lack of specific bacteria may lead to increased susceptibility of A. albopictus to DENV. Interventions in the microbiome composition or specific bacteria of A. albopictus may affect the susceptibility to DENV and control the mosquito-borne diseases efficiently.

TI  - Metatranscriptomic insights into the dengue patient blood microbiome: Enhanced microbial diversity and metabolic activity in severe patients
JF  - PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 18
AB  - Background Dengue is the most re-emergent infection, with approximately 100 million new cases reported annually, yet no effective treatment or vaccine exists. Here, we aim to define the microbial community structure and their functional profiles in the dengue positive patients with varying disease severity. Methodology/Principal findings Hospital admitted 112 dengue-positive patients blood samples were analyzed by dual RNA-sequencing to simultaneously identify the transcriptionally active microbes (TAMs), their expressed genes and associated pathways. Results highlight that patients with severe dengue exhibited increased microbial diversity and presence of opportunistic species (unique and core) which includes Bacillus cereus, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Streptococcus suis, and Serratia marcescens. The functional profile analysis revealed enriched metabolic pathways such as protein degradation, nucleotide biosynthesis, ion transport, cell shape integrity, and ATP formation in severe cases, indicating the high energy demands and adaptability of these microbes. Conclusion Our metatranscriptomic approach provides a species-level characterization of blood microbiome composition and reveals a heightened diversity of TAMs in patients with severe dengue, underscoring the need for further research into the role of blood microbiota in disease progression. Comparing the microbial signatures across the severity classes early in the disease offers unique potential for convenient and early diagnosis of dengue infection.

TI  - Methylytransferase Activity of Dengue RNA virus by Using Purified Protein
JF  - International Journal of Drug Development and Research
AB  - Dengue disease (DENV) is the purpose behind dengue fever. It is a mosquito-borne single positive-stranded RNA contamination of the family Flaviviridae; sort Flavivirus. Dengue illness is a mosquito-borne making or re-rising pathogen. Its positive sense RNA genome has a top at the 5'- end and no poly(A) tail at the 3'- end. The viral RNA encodes a single polyprotein, C-M-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5. The polyprotein is prepared into three auxiliary proteins (C, M, and E) and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5). NS3 and NS5 are multifunctional chemicals performing different undertakings in the viral life cycle. The N-terminal area of NS5 has unmistakable GTP and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) restricting locales. The job of GTP restricting site is trapped in the guanylyltransferase (GTase) movement of NS5. We depict the development of the MTase space of NS5 in an E. coli articulation vector and conditions for enzymatic activity of N7-and 2'O-methyltransferase exercises that yield the last sort I 5'- topped RNA.

TI  - MicroRNA 573 Rescues Endothelial Dysfunction during Dengue Virus Infection under PPARγ Regulation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - We need to identify molecular factors that can predict the onset of endothelial dysfunction in dengue patients. Increase in endothelial permeability during severe dengue infections is poorly understood. ABSTRACT Early prognosis of abnormal vasculopathy is essential for effective clinical management of patients with severe dengue. An exaggerated interferon (IFN) response and release of vasoactive factors from endothelial cells cause vasculopathy. This study shows that dengue virus 2 (DENV2) infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) results in differentially regulated microRNAs (miRNAs) important for endothelial function. miR-573 was significantly downregulated in DENV2-infected HUVEC due to decreased peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma (PPARγ) activity. Restoring miR-573 expression decreased endothelial permeability by suppressing the expression of vasoactive angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2). We also found that miR-573 suppressed the proinflammatory IFN response through direct downregulation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression. Our study provides a novel insight into miR-573-mediated regulation of endothelial function during DENV2 infection, which can be further translated into a potential therapeutic and prognostic agent for severe dengue patients. IMPORTANCE We need to identify molecular factors that can predict the onset of endothelial dysfunction in dengue patients. Increase in endothelial permeability during severe dengue infections is poorly understood. In this study, we focus on factors that regulate endothelial function and are dysregulated during DENV2 infection. We show that miR-573 rescues endothelial permeability and is downregulated during DENV2 infection in endothelial cells. This finding can have both diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

TI  - MicroRNA levels are modulated in Aedes aegypti after exposure to Dengue‐2
JF  - Insect Molecular Biology
VL  - 23
AB  - To define microRNA (miRNA) involvement during arbovirus infection of Aedes aegypti, we mined deep sequencing libraries of Dengue type 2 (DENV2)‐exposed mosquitoes. Three biological replicates for each timepoint [2, 4 and 9 days post‐exposure (dpe)] and treatment group allowed us to remove the outliers associated with sample‐to‐sample variability. Using edgeR (R Bioconductor), designed for use with replicate deep sequencing data, we determined the log fold‐change (logFC) of miRNA levels [18–23 nucleotides (nt)]. The number of significantly modulated miRNAs increased from ≤5 at 2 and 4 dpe to 23 unique miRNAs by 9 dpe. Putative miRNA targets were predicted by aligning miRNAs to the transcriptome, and the list was reduced to include the intersection of hits found using the Miranda, PITA, and TargetScan algorithms. To further reduce false‐positives, putative targets were validated by cross‐checking them with mRNAs reported in recent DENV2 host response transcriptome reports; 4076 targets were identified. Of these, 464 gene targets have predicted miRNA‐binding sites in 3′ untranslated regions. Context‐specific target functional groups include proteins involved in transport, transcriptional regulation, mitochondrial function, chromatin modification and signal transduction processes known to be required for viral replication and dissemination. The miRNA response is placed in context with other vector host response studies by comparing the predicted targets with those of transcriptome studies. Together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that profound and persistent changes to gene expression occur in DENV2‐exposed mosquitoes.

TI  - MicroRNA profiling of human primary macrophages exposed to dengue virus identifies miRNA-3614-5p as antiviral and regulator of ADAR1 expression
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 11
AB  - Background Due to the high burden of dengue disease worldwide, a better understanding of the interactions between dengue virus (DENV) and its human host cells is of the utmost importance. Although microRNAs modulate the outcome of several viral infections, their contribution to DENV replication is poorly understood. Methods and principal findings We investigated the microRNA expression profile of primary human macrophages challenged with DENV and deciphered the contribution of microRNAs to infection. To this end, human primary macrophages were challenged with GFP-expressing DENV and sorted to differentiate between truly infected cells (DENV-positive) and DENV-exposed but non-infected cells (DENV-negative cells). The miRNAome was determined by small RNA-Seq analysis and the effect of differentially expressed microRNAs on DENV yield was examined. Five microRNAs were differentially expressed in human macrophages challenged with DENV. Of these, miR-3614-5p was found upregulated in DENV-negative cells and its overexpression reduced DENV infectivity. The cellular targets of miR-3614-5p were identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and western blot. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) was identified as one of the targets of miR-3614-5p and was shown to promote DENV infectivity at early time points post-infection. Conclusion/Significance Overall, miRNAs appear to play a limited role in DENV replication in primary human macrophages. The miRNAs that were found upregulated in DENV-infected cells did not control the production of infectious virus particles. On the other hand, miR-3614-5p, which was upregulated in DENV-negative macrophages, reduced DENV infectivity and regulated ADAR1 expression, a protein that facilitates viral replication.

TI  - MicroRNA profiling of mouse liver in response to DENV-1 infection by deep sequencing
JF  - PeerJ
VL  - 7
AB  - Background
Dengue caused by dengue virus (DENV) serotypes -1 to -4 is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in the tropical and sub-tropical countries worldwide. Yet many of the pathophysiological mechanisms of host responses during DENV infection remain largely unknown and incompletely understood.


Methods
Using a mouse model, the miRNA expressions in liver during DENV-1 infection was investigated using high throughput miRNA sequencing. The differential expressions of miRNAs were then validated by qPCR, followed by target genes prediction. The identified miRNA targets were subjected to gene ontology (GO) annotation and pathway enrichment analysis to elucidate the potential biological pathways and molecular mechanisms associated with DENV-1 infection.


Results
A total of 224 and 372 miRNAs out of 433 known mouse miRNAs were detected in the livers of DENV-1-infected and uninfected mice, respectively; of these, 207 miRNAs were present in both libraries. The miR-148a-3p and miR-122-5p were the two most abundant miRNAs in both groups. Thirty-one miRNAs were found to have at least 2-fold change in upregulation or downregulation, in which seven miRNAs were upregulated and 24 miRNAs were downregulated in the DENV-1-infected mouse livers. The miR-1a-3p was found to be the most downregulated miRNA in the DENV-1-infected mouse livers, with a significant fold change of 0.10. To validate the miRNA sequencing result, the expression pattern of 12 miRNAs, which were highly differentially expressed or most abundant, were assessed by qPCR and nine of them correlated positively with the one observed in deep sequencing. In silico functional analysis revealed that the adaptive immune responses involving TGF-beta, MAPK, PI3K-Akt, Rap1, Wnt and Ras signalling pathways were modulated collectively by 23 highly differentially expressed miRNAs during DENV-1 infection.


Conclusion
This study provides the first insight into the global miRNA expressions of mouse livers in response to DENV-1 infection in vivo and the possible roles of miRNAs in modulating the adaptive immune responses during DENV-1 infection.

TI  - MicroRNA-30e* Suppresses Dengue Virus Replication by Promoting NF-κB–Dependent IFN Production
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 8
AB  - MicroRNAs have been shown to contribute to a repertoire of host-pathogen interactions during viral infection. Our previous study demonstrated that microRNA-30e* (miR-30e*) directly targeted the IκBα 3′-UTR and disrupted the NF-κB/IκBα negative feedback loop, leading to hyperactivation of NF-κB. This current study investigated the possible role of miR-30e* in the regulation of innate immunity associated with dengue virus (DENV) infection. We found that DENV infection could induce miR-30e* expression in DENV-permissive cells, and such an overexpression of miR-30e* upregulated IFN-β and the downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as OAS1, MxA and IFITM1, and suppressed DENV replication. Furthermore, suppression of IκBα mediates the enhancing effect of miR-30e* on IFN-β-induced antiviral response. Collectively, our findings suggest a modulatory role of miR-30e* in DENV induced IFN-β signaling via the NF-κB-dependent pathway. Further investigation is needed to evaluate whether miR-30e* has an anti-DENV effect in vivo.

TI  - MicroRNA-like viral small RNA from Dengue virus 2 autoregulates its replication in mosquito cells
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 111
SP  - 2746
EP  - 2751
AB  - Significance Dengue virus has emerged as one of the most significant arboviruses, affecting millions of people around the world. Here, we show the production of a functional microRNA-like small RNA encoded by Dengue virus, which negatively regulates virus replication by targeting the viral nonstructural protein 1 sequences. The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the biogenesis and function of the viral small RNA. The results also highlight the possibility of utilizing the small RNA in inhibiting at least three serotypes of the virus. The outcomes have a significant impact on our understanding of the biology of the virus (and flaviviruses in general) and small RNA biogenesis, and open up a potential avenue for the control of the virus. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that play significant roles in most cellular processes. In the seemingly endless arms race between hosts and pathogens, viruses also encode miRNAs that facilitate successful infection. In search of functional miRNAs or viral small RNAs (vsRNAs) encoded by Dengue virus (DENV), deep sequencing data of virus-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were used. From six vsRNAs, with candidate stem-loop structures in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of the viral genomic RNA, inhibition of DENV–vsRNA-5 led to significant increases in viral replication. Silencing of RNA interference (RNAi)/miRNA pathways’ associated proteins showed that Argonaute 2 is mainly involved in DENV–vsRNA-5 biogenesis. Cloning of the precursor stem loop, immunoprecipitations, ectopic expression and detection in RNAi-deficient C6/36, and the mammalian Vero cell lines further confirmed DENV–vsRNA-5 production. Furthermore, significant impact of synthetic mimic and inhibitor of DENV–vsRNA-5 on DENV RNA levels revealed DENV–vsRNA-5’s role in virus autoregulation by targeting the virus nonstructural protein 1 gene. Notably, DENV–vsRNA-5 homologous mimics from DENV serotypes 1 and 4, but not 3, inhibited DENV-2 replication. The results revealed that DENV is able to encode functional vsRNAs, and one of those, which resembles miRNAs, specifically targets a viral gene, opening an avenue for possible utilization of the small RNA to limit DENV replication.

TI  - MicroRNA‐155 inhibits dengue virus replication by inducing heme oxygenase‐1‐mediated antiviral interferon responses
JF  - The FASEB Journal
VL  - 34
SP  - 7283
EP  - 7294
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to directly alter the virus life cycle and virus–host interactions, and so are considered promising molecules for controlling virus infection. In the present study, we observed that miR‐155 time‐dependently downregulated upon dengue virus (DENV) infection. In contrast, exogenous overexpression of miR‐155 appeared to limit viral replication in vitro, suggesting that the low levels of miR‐155 would be beneficial for DENV replication. In vivo, overexpression of miR‐155 protected ICR suckling mice from the life‐threatening effects of DENV infection and reduced virus propagation. Further investigation revealed that the anti‐DENV activity of miR‐155 was due to target Bach1, resulting in the induction of the heme oxygenase‐1 (HO‐1)‐mediated inhibition of DENV NS2B/NS3 protease activity, ultimately leading to induction of antiviral interferon responses, including interferon‐induced protein kinase R (PKR), 2′‐5′‐oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), OAS2, and OAS3 expression, against DENV replication. Collectively, our results provide a promising new strategy to manage DENV infection by modulation of miR‐155 expression.

Due to their intimate association with the host, microbes have developed strategies that facilitate their transmission, either horizontally or vertically, to conspecifics. These attributes make microbes attractive agents for applied strategies to control arthropod-borne disease. Here we discuss the recent advances in microbial control approaches to reduce the burden of pathogens such as Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses, and Trypanosome and Plasmodium parasites. We also highlight where further investigation is warranted.

TI  - Midgut transcriptomic responses to dengue and chikungunya viruses in the vectors Aedes albopictus and Aedes malayensis
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses are among the most preponderant arboviruses. Although primarily transmitted through the bite of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus and Aedes malayensis are competent vectors and have an impact on arbovirus epidemiology. Here, to fill the gap in our understanding of the molecular interactions between secondary vectors and arboviruses, we used transcriptomics to profile the whole-genome responses of A. albopictus to CHIKV and of A. malayensis to CHIKV and DENV at 1 and 4 days post-infection (dpi) in midguts. In A. albopictus , 1793 and 339 genes were significantly regulated by CHIKV at 1 and 4 dpi, respectively. In A. malayensis , 943 and 222 genes upon CHIKV infection, and 74 and 69 genes upon DENV infection were significantly regulated at 1 and 4 dpi, respectively. We reported 81 genes that were consistently differentially regulated in all the CHIKV-infected conditions, identifying a CHIKV-induced signature. We identified expressed immune genes in both mosquito species, using a de novo assembled midgut transcriptome for A. malayensis , and described the immune architectures. We found the JNK pathway activated in all conditions, generalizing its antiviral function to Aedines. Our comprehensive study provides insight into arbovirus transmission by multiple Aedes vectors.

JF  - Transactions of The Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene

EP  - 
AB  - Dengue viral infections are endemic or epidemic in virtually all tropical countries. Among individuals infected with the dengue virus, severe dengue syndromes (i.e., dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndromes) tend to affect only some and this may be due to a combination of host genetic susceptibility and viral factors. In this review article we analyse and discuss the present knowledge of non-human leucocyte antigen host genetic susceptibility to severe dengue syndromes. The relevance of genetic polymorphisms in the pathways of antigen recognition, uptake, processing and presentation, activation of interferon α responses, mast cell and complement activation and T cell activation and dengue disease severity has been reviewed and analysed.

TI  - Mitochondrial Import of Dengue Virus NS3 Protease and Cleavage of GrpEL1, a Cochaperone of Mitochondrial Hsp70
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - Approximately 40% of the world’s population is at risk of dengue virus infection. There is currently no specific drug or potential vaccine for these infections. Lack of complete understanding of the pathogenesis of the virus is one of the hurdles that must be overcome in developing antivirals for this virus infection. In the present study, we observed that the dengue virus-coded protease imports to the mitochondrial matrix, and our report is the first ever of a virus-coded protein, either animal or human, importing to the mitochondrial matrix. Our analysis indicates that the observed mitochondrial import is due to an inherited mitochondrial transport signal. We also show that matrix-localized GrpE protein homolog 1 (GrpEL1), a cochaperone of mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70), is also the substrate of dengue virus protease, as observed in vitro and ex vivo in virus-infected cells and dengue virus-infected clinical samples. Hence, our studies reveal an essential aspect of the pathogenesis of dengue virus infections, which may aid in developing antidengue therapeutics. ABSTRACT Dengue virus infections, which have been reported in nearly 140 countries, pose a significant threat to human health. The genome of dengue virus encodes three structural and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins along with two untranslated regions, one each on both ends. Among them, dengue protease (NS3) plays a pivotal role in polyprotein processing and virus multiplication. NS3 is also known to regulate several host proteins to induce and maintain pathogenesis. Certain viral proteins are known to interact with mitochondrial membrane proteins and interfere with their functions, but the association of a virus-coded protein with the mitochondrial matrix is not known. In this report, by using in silico analysis, we show that NS3pro alone is capable of mitochondrial import; however, this is dependent on its innate mitochondrial transport signal (MTS). Transient-transfection and protein import studies confirm the import of NS3pro to the mitochondrial matrix. Similarly, NS3pro-helicase (amino acids 1 to 464 of NS3) also targets the mitochondria. Intriguingly, reduced levels of matrix-localized GrpE protein homolog 1 (GrpEL1), a cochaperone of mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70), were noticed in NS3pro-expressing, NS3pro-helicase-expressing, and virus-infected cells. Upon the use of purified components, GrpEL1 undergoes cleavage, and the cleavage sites have been mapped to KR81A and QR92S. Importantly, GrpEL1 levels are seriously compromised in severe dengue virus-infected clinical samples. Our studies provide novel insights into the import of NS3 into host mitochondria and identify a hitherto unknown factor, GrpEL1, as a cleavage target, thereby providing new avenues for dengue virus research and the design of potential therapeutics.

TI  - Mobilization and Activation of the Innate Immune Response to Dengue Virus
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue virus is an important human pathogen, infecting an estimated 400 million individuals per year and causing symptomatic disease in a subset of approximately 100 million. Much of the effort to date describing the host response to dengue has focused on the adaptive immune response, in part because of the well-established roles of antibody-dependent enhancement and T cell original sin as drivers of severe dengue upon heterotypic secondary infection. However, the innate immune system is a crucial factor in the host response to dengue, as it both governs the fate and vigor of the adaptive immune response, and mediates the acute inflammatory response in tissues. In this review, we discuss the innate inflammatory response to dengue infection, focusing on the role of evolutionarily conserved innate immune cells, their effector functions, and clinical course.

JF  - Thrombosis and Haemostasis
VL  - 101
SP  - 916
EP  - 928
AB  - Summary Dengue fever (DF) is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease of humans. No safe vaccine is available, there is no experimental animal model and no specific treatment (antiviral) for Dengue virus (DV) infection exists. The pathogenic mechanisms of the severe forms of the disease, such as Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), in which endothelial damage is the pathognomonic sign, are not fully understood. Clinical observations have revealed significant abnormalities in the coagulation and inflammation systems, with increased levels of soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) in the plasma of patients with DHF/DSS (grade III or IV). Blood sTM was proposed as an early predictor of DSS during the febrile stage. However, the role of the DV in endothelial injury during DSS is unclear. Here, we present novel insights into the participation of DV in the downregulation of the thrombomodulin-thrombin-protein C complex formation at the endothelial surface, with a reduction in activated protein C (APC). APC is the most important vasoprotective protein because it downregulates thrombin generation (by the inactivation of procoagulant factors Va and VIIIa) and has anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and barrier protection properties. These biological functions of APC are associated with the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and pro-tease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) signalling pathways, which link the coagulation-inflammation responses. We found alterations in the antithrombotic and cytoprotective protein C pathways during DV infection of human endothelial vascular cells, which may explain the vasculopathy observed during DHF/DSS. Clarification of the basic principles that underlie these processes has important implications for the design of new therapeutic strategies for DHF/DSS.

TI  - Modulation of Lipid Droplet Metabolism—A Potential Target for Therapeutic Intervention in Flaviviridae Infections
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related dynamic organelles that store and regulate fatty acids and neutral lipids. They play a central role in cellular energy storage, lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis. It has become evident that viruses have co-evolved in order to exploit host lipid metabolic pathways. This is especially characteristic of the Flaviviridae family, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and several flaviviruses. Devoid of an appropriate lipid biosynthetic machinery of their own, these single-strand positive-sense RNA viruses can induce dramatic changes in host metabolic pathways to establish a favorable environment for viral multiplication and acquire essential components to facilitate their assembly and traffic. Here we have reviewed the current knowledge on the intracellular life cycle of those from the Flaviviridae family, with particular emphasis on HCV and dengue virus (DENV), and their association with the biosynthesis and metabolism of LDs, with the aim to identify potential antiviral targets for development of novel therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Modulation of acyl-carnitines, the broad mechanism behind Wolbachia-mediated inhibition of medically important flaviviruses in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 117
SP  - 24475
EP  - 24483
AB  - Significance Wolbachia (wMel strain)-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are refractory to disseminated arboviral infections. Yet previous studies into the mechanism behind Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking have not considered the involvement of lipids, apart from cholesterol, during superinfection. We used liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to study the lipidome in mosquito cells infected with virus, wMel, or superinfected with both virus and wMel. Interestingly, a class of lipids, acyl-carnitines increased during virus infection but remained low with wMel. These findings uncover a previously unknown role for acyl-carnitines in the interaction among virus, wMel, and cells, suggesting a mechanism underlying Wolbachia-mediated pathogen blocking. Importantly, this study supports Wolbachia introgression into A. Aegypti populations as a biocontrol method to reduce arboviral (e.g., DENV) transmission. Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are refractory to flavivirus infections, but the role of lipids in Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking remains to be elucidated. Here, we use liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to provide a comprehensive picture of the lipidome of Aedes aegypti (Aag2) cells infected with Wolbachia only, either dengue or Zika virus only, and Wolbachia-infected Aag2 cells superinfected with either dengue or Zika virus. This approach identifies a class of lipids, acyl-carnitines, as being down-regulated during Wolbachia infection. Furthermore, treatment with an acyl-carnitine inhibitor assigns a crucial role for acyl-carnitines in the replication of dengue and Zika viruses. In contrast, depletion of acyl-carnitines increases Wolbachia density while addition of commercially available acyl-carnitines impairs Wolbachia production. Finally, we show an increase in flavivirus infection of Wolbachia-infected cells with the addition of acyl-carnitines. This study uncovers a previously unknown role for acyl-carnitines in this tripartite interaction that suggests an important and broad mechanism that underpins Wolbachia-mediated pathogen blocking.

JF  - Viral immunology
VL  - 17 2
SP  - 252
EP  - 65
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) is a flavivirus carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito that causes a spectrum of illnesses in the tropics, including dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells recently shown to be permissive for DV, and implicated as the primary targets of initial DV infection. DV is transmitted to human host by infected mosquitoes during a blood meal, but it is currently unknown whether transmission is modified by vector saliva that is also deposited in the host's skin during feeding. Previous studies evaluated only the outcome of DV infection of DCs, and did not address the influence of mosquito saliva. To more fully characterize natural transmission of DV, we evaluated the effects of Ae. aegypti saliva on DV infection of human myeloid DCs. We found that saliva inhibited DV infection in DCs. Moreover, pre-sensitization of DCs with saliva, prior to DV infection, enhanced inhibition. In addition, enhanced production of IL-12p70 and TNF-alpha were detected in DV-infected DC cultures exposed to mosquito saliva. The proportion of dead cells was also significantly reduced in these cultures. These data contribute to the overall understanding of the natural pathogenesis of DV infection and suggest that there is a protective role for mosquito saliva that limits viral uptake by DCs.

Understanding the intricate interplay between arboviruses and the immune system within the central nervous system is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat these infections and mitigate their neurological sequelae. This review comprehensively explores the mechanisms by which arboviruses such as Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Dengue virus manipulate immune responses within the CNS, leading to diverse clinical manifestations.

TI  - Modulation of the Nucleoside Triphosphatase/RNA Helicase and 5′-RNA Triphosphatase Activities of Dengue Virus Type 2 Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) by Interaction with NS5, the RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 280
SP  - 27412
EP  - 27419
AB  - Dengue virus type 2 (DEN2), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is a re-emerging human pathogen of global significance. DEN2 nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) has a serine protease domain (NS3-pro) and requires the hydrophilic domain of NS2B (NS2BH) for activation. NS3 is also an RNA-stimulated nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase)/RNA helicase and a 5′-RNA triphosphatase (RTPase). In this study the first biochemical and kinetic properties of full-length NS3 (NS3FL)-associated NTPase, RTPase, and RNA helicase are presented. The NS3FL showed an enhanced RNA helicase activity compared with the NS3-pro-minus NS3, which was further enhanced by the presence of the NS2BH (NS2BH-NS3FL). An active protease catalytic triad is not required for the stimulatory effect, suggesting that the overall folding of the N-terminal protease domain contributes to this enhancement. In DEN2-infected mammalian cells, NS3 and NS5, the viral 5′-RNA methyltransferase/polymerase, exist as a complex. Therefore, the effect of NS5 on the NS3 NTPase activity was examined. The results show that NS5 stimulated the NS3 NTPase and RTPase activities. The NS5 stimulation of NS3 NTPase was dose-dependent until an equimolar ratio was reached. Moreover, the conserved motif, 184RKRK, of NS3 played a crucial role in binding to RNA substrate and modulating the NTPase/RNA helicase and RTPase activities of NS3.

TI  - Modulation of α-Enolase Post-Translational Modifications by Dengue Virus: Increased Secretion of the Basic Isoforms in Infected Hepatic Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - Hepatic cells are major sites of dengue virus (DENV) replication and liver injury constitutes a characteristic of severe forms of dengue. The role of hepatic cells in dengue pathogenesis is not well established, but since hepatocytes are the major source of plasma proteins, changes in protein secretion by these cells during infection might contribute to disease progression. Previously, we showed that DENV infection alters the secretion pattern of hepatic HepG2 cells, with α-enolase appearing as one of the major proteins secreted in higher levels by infected cells. ELISA analysis demonstrated that DENV infection modulates α-enolase secretion in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, but has no effect on its gene expression and on the intracellular content of the protein as assessed by PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. Two-dimensional western blots showed that both intracellular and secreted forms of α-enolase appear as five spots, revealing α-enolase isoforms with similar molecular weights but distinct isoeletric points. Remarkably, quantification of each spot content revealed that DENV infection shifts the isoform distribution pattern of secreted α-enolase towards the basic isoforms, whereas the intracellular protein remains unaltered, suggesting that post-translational modifications might be involved in α-enolase secretion by infected cells. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying α-enolase secretion by hepatic cells and its relationship with the role of liver in dengue pathogenesis. In addition, preliminary results obtained with plasma samples from DENV-infected patients suggest an association between plasma levels of α-enolase and disease severity. Since α-enolase binds plasminogen and modulates its activation, it is plausible to speculate the association of the increase in α-enolase secretion by infected hepatic cells with the haemostatic dysfunction observed in dengue patients including the promotion of fibrinolysis and vascular permeability alterations.

VL  - 25 8

EP  - 719
AB  - BACKGROUND
At the present time, dengue is one of the most important arboviruses affecting man, becoming a serious global public health problem, especially in subtropical and tropical countries, where environmental conditions favor the development and proliferation of the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Dengue is caused by a type of flavivírus, which is an enveloped virus of spherical geometry. Nowadays, it is one of the diseases with the highest incidence in Brazil, reaching the population of all states, regardless of social class. Several papers address the molecular aspects of infection of human cell by the viruses, which are reviewed in this work.


CONCLUSION
Analyzing the three-dimensional structures of the fusion peptide of dengue virus protein E, we observed that the fusion peptide presents a region rich in hydrophobic residues and a "collar" of charged, polar residues. Probably, this hydrophilic collar plays an important role in the fusion process between the dengue virus and the cell membrane. In order for this disease to cease being a serious global public health problem, we must deepen our knowledge about the fusion process between the dengue virus and the cell membrane through further experimental and, especially, computational studies to find ways to inhibit the mechanism of virus infection.

JF  - Intervirology
VL  - 61

EP  - 264
AB  - Mosquitoes are considered the most important vectors for the transmission of pathogens to humans. Aedes aegypti is a unique species, not only by its highly anthropophilic and peridomestic habits but also because it can transmit an important variety of pathogenic viruses. Examples are dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, Zika, and Mayaro viruses. After ingesting viremic blood, a wide range of mechanisms are activated in the mosquito to counteract viral infection. Nevertheless, these arboviruses possess strategies to overcome barriers in the mosquito and eventually reach the salivary glands to continue the transmission cycle. However, the infection and eventual transmission of arbovirus depends on multiple factors. The current review focuses in detail on the anatomic, physiological, and molecular characteristics of the mosquito A. aegypti that participate in response to a viral infection. In the past decades, the awareness of the importance of this mosquito as a disease vector and its impact on human health was largely recognized. We need to improve our comprehension of molecular mechanisms that determine the outcome of successful virus replication or control of infection for each arbovirus in the vector; this could lead to the design of effective control strategies in the future.

AB  - Dengue fever is a rapidly emerging vector-borne viral disease with a growing global burden of approximately 390 million new infections per annum. The Dengue virus (DENV) is a flavivirus spread by female mosquitos of the aedes genus, but the mechanism of viral endocytosis is poorly understood at a molecular level, preventing the development of effective transmission blocking vaccines (TBVs). Recently, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have been identified as playing a role during initial viral attachment through interaction with the third domain of the viral envelope protein (EDIII). Here, we report a systematic study investigating the effect of a range of biologically relevant GAGs on the structure and oligomeric state of recombinantly generated EDIII. We provide novel in situ biophysical evidence that heparin and chondroitin sulphate C induce conformational changes in EDIII at the secondary structure level. Furthermore, we report the ability of chondroitin sulphate C to bind EDIII and induce higher-order dynamic molecular changes at the tertiary and quaternary structure levels which are dependent on pH, GAG species, and the GAG sulphation state. Lastly, we conducted ab initio modelling of Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) data to visualise the induced oligomeric state of EDIII caused by interaction with chondroitin sulphate C, which may aid in TBV development.

TI  - Molecular Determinants of Tissue Specificity of Flavivirus Nonstructural Protein 1 Interaction with Endothelial Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - Flavivirus NS1 is secreted into the bloodstream from infected cells during a viral infection. Dengue virus NS1 contributes to severe dengue pathology such as endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak independently of the virus. ABSTRACT Members of the mosquito-borne flavivirus genus such as dengue (DENV), West Nile (WNV), and Zika (ZIKV) viruses cause distinct diseases and affect different tissues. We previously found that the secreted flaviviral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) interacts with endothelial cells and disrupts endothelial barrier function in a tissue-specific manner consistent with the disease tropism of the respective viruses. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this tissue-specific NS1-endothelial cell interaction is not well understood. To elucidate the distinct role(s) that the wing and β-ladder domains of NS1 play in NS1 interactions with endothelial cells, we constructed flavivirus NS1 chimeras that exchanged the wing and β-ladder domains in a pairwise manner between DENV, WNV, and ZIKV NS1. We found that both the NS1 wing and β-ladder domains conferred NS1 tissue-specific endothelial dysfunction, with the wing conferring cell binding and the β-ladder involved in inducing endothelial hyperpermeability as measured by transendothelial electrical resistance. To narrow down the amino acids dictating cell binding specificity, we utilized the DENV-WNV NS1 chimera and identified residues 91 to 93 (GDI) of DENV NS1 as a molecular motif determining binding specificity. Further, using an in vivo mouse model of localized leak, we found that the GDI motif of the wing domain was essential for triggering DENV NS1-induced vascular leak in mouse dermis. Taken together, we identify molecular determinants of flavivirus NS1 that confer NS1 binding and vascular leak and highlight the importance of the NS1 wing domain for flavivirus pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Flavivirus NS1 is secreted into the bloodstream from infected cells during a viral infection. Dengue virus NS1 contributes to severe dengue pathology such as endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak independently of the virus. We have shown that multiple flavivirus NS1 proteins result in endothelial dysfunction in a tissue-specific manner consistent with their respective viral tropism. Here, we aimed to identify the molecular determinants that make some, but not other, flavivirus NS1 proteins bind to select endothelial cells in vitro and cause vascular leak in a mouse model. We identified the wing domain of NS1 as a primary determinant conferring differential endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak and narrowed the contributing amino acid residues to a three-residue motif within the wing domain. The insights from this study pave the way for future studies on the effects of flavivirus NS1 on viral dissemination and pathogenesis and offer potential new avenues for antiviral therapies.

VL  - 
AB  - The immune response to viral infection involves a complexity of both innate and adaptive pathways at the cellular and the molecular level. There are many approaches to begin to define the pathways at work to control viral pathogenesis. The approach favored in this thesis was to conduct a broad screen of the innate immune response at the gene expression level of infected cells. The innate immune response is critical to the control of viral infections. Type I interferons (IFN), IFNα and IFNβ, are antiviral proteins that are an integral part of the innate immune response. Furthermore, by virtue of their effects on maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells, IFNs are a pivotal link between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Most cell types produce type-I IFN when exposed to viruses. However, viruses have evolved multiple strategies to suppress IFN production or signaling. It is imperative to understand the virus-host interaction at the molecular level in order to identify as yet unknown mechanisms of the host antiviral response; these additional pathways may be useful in counteracting the viral suppression of IFN. Type-I IFNs regulate expression of at least five hundred genes, suggesting a complex network of signaling pathways. Depending on the cell type different proteins regulate the induction of IFN or the expression of IFN-inducible genes. Identification of proteins that induce selected IFN-inducible genes may provide synergistic activity with or may have an advantage over type-I IFN for anti-viral therapy in the future. Many diseases are untreatable if identified late in their progression. In resource-limited countries, many diseases are diagnosed clinically, which can lead to incorrect or delayed diagnosis and treatment. The identification of biomarkers of disease has the potential to guide the correct therapy in a timely fashion. The objective of this thesis was to identify novel anti-viral therapies and disease biomarkers for dengue virus (DENV) infection. DENV is a mosquito-borne positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, which causes an estimated 50 million infections annually. Most DENV infections result in a febrile illness called Dengue fever (DF). Less frequently, infections cause Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), a potentially fatal vascular leakage syndrome associated with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. At present patients infected with DENV can only be treated by intravenous fluid support to prevent hypovolemia and hypotensive shock. This treatment is less effective in severe cases if the diagnosis is delayed. Identification of therapeutics with both antiviral and immune-modulatory activity may lower patient mortality and reduce the burden of DENV on society. DENV infection is cleared in most individuals after a short period of viremia {Libraty, 20022225}. Based on in vitro and mouse models, type-I and type-II IFN signaling pathways are thought to be critical in the regulation of DENV infection. Higher serum levels of type I and type II IFNs…

TI  - Molecular Events Occurring in Lipophagy and Its Regulation in Flaviviridae Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Diseases caused by Flaviviridae have a wide global and economic impact due to high morbidity and mortality. Flaviviridae infection usually leads to severe, acute or chronic diseases, such as liver injury and liver cancer resulting from hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) caused by dengue virus (DENV). Given the highly complex pathogenesis of Flaviviridae infections, they are still not fully understood at present. Accumulating evidence suggests that host autophagy is disrupted to regulate the life cycle of Flaviviridae. Organelle-specific autophagy is able to selectively target different organelles for quality control, which is essential for regulating cellular homeostasis. As an important sub process of autophagy, lipophagy regulates lipid metabolism by targeting lipid droplets (LDs) and is also closely related to the infection of a variety of pathogenic microorganisms. In this review, we briefly understand the LDs interaction relationship with Flaviviridae infection, outline the molecular events of how lipophagy occurs and the related research progress on the regulatory mechanisms of lipophagy in Flaviviridae infection. Exploring the crosstalk between viral infection and lipophagy induced molecular events may provide new avenues for antiviral therapy.

TI  - Molecular Insights into the Flavivirus Replication Complex
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Flaviviruses are vector-borne RNA viruses, many of which are clinically relevant human viral pathogens, such as dengue, Zika, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile and yellow fever viruses. Millions of people are infected with these viruses around the world each year. Vaccines are only available for some members of this large virus family, and there are no effective antiviral drugs to treat flavivirus infections. The unmet need for vaccines and therapies against these flaviviral infections drives research towards a better understanding of the epidemiology, biology and immunology of flaviviruses. In this review, we discuss the basic biology of the flavivirus replication process and focus on the molecular aspects of viral genome replication. Within the virus-induced intracellular membranous compartments, flaviviral RNA genome replication takes place, starting from viral poly protein expression and processing to the assembly of the virus RNA replication complex, followed by the delivery of the progeny viral RNA to the viral particle assembly sites. We attempt to update the latest understanding of the key molecular events during this process and highlight knowledge gaps for future studies.

EP  - 9736
AB  - The pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), both serious complications of dengue virus (DV) infection, remains unclear. In this study, we found that anti-DV NS1 (nonstructural protein 1) polyclonal antibodies cross-reacted with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We further identified a complex-specific mAb, DB16-1, which could recognize DV NS1 and cross-react with HUVECs and human blood vessels. The target protein of DB16-1 was further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. LC-MS/MS analysis and co-immunoprecipitation revealed that the target protein of DB16-1 was human LYRIC (lysine-rich CEACAM1 co-isolated). Our newly generated anti-LYRIC mAbs bound to HUVECs in a pattern similar to that of DB16-1. The B-cell epitope of DB16-1 displayed a consensus motif, Lys-X-Trp-Gly (KXWG), which corresponded to amino acid residues 116–119 of DV NS1 and mimicked amino acid residues 334–337 in LYRIC. Moreover, the binding activity of DB16-1 in NS1 of DV-2 and in LYRIC disappeared after the KXWG epitope was deleted in each. In conclusion, DB16-1 targeted the same epitope in DV NS1 and LYRIC protein on human endothelial cells, suggesting that it might play a role in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS. Future studies on the role of the anti-NS1 antibody in causing vascular permeability will undoubtedly be performed on sera collected from individuals before, during, and after the endothelial cell malfunction phase of a dengue illness.

TI  - Molecular Responses of Human Retinal Cells to Infection with Dengue Virus
JF  - Mediators of Inflammation
VL  - 2017
AB  - Recent clinical reports indicate that infection with dengue virus (DENV) commonly has ocular manifestations. The most serious threat to vision is dengue retinopathy, including retinal vasculopathy and macular edema. Mechanisms of retinopathy are unstudied, but observations in patients implicate retinal pigment epithelial cells and retinal endothelial cells. Human retinal cells were inoculated with DENV-2 and monitored for up to 72 hours. Epithelial and endothelial cells supported DENV replication and release, but epithelial cells alone demonstrated clear cytopathic effect, and infection was more productive in those cells. Infection induced type I interferon responses from both cells, but this was stronger in epithelial cells. Endothelial cells increased expression of adhesion molecules, with sustained overexpression of vascular adhesion molecule-1. Transcellular impedance decreased for epithelial monolayers, but not endothelial monolayers, coinciding with cytopathic effect. This reduction was accompanied by disorganization of intracellular filamentous-actin and decreased expression of junctional molecules, zonula occludens 1, and catenin-β1. Changes in endothelial expression of adhesion molecules are consistent with the retinal vasculopathy seen in patients infected with DENV; decreases in epithelial junctional protein expression, paralleling loss of integrity of the epithelium, provide a molecular basis for DENV-associated macular edema. These molecular processes present potential therapeutic targets for vision-threatening dengue retinopathy.

TI  - Molecular Strategies for Interrupting Arthropod-Borne Virus Transmission by Mosquitoes
JF  - Clinical Microbiology Reviews
VL  - 13
SP  - 651
EP  - 661
AB  - SUMMARY Arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) infections cause a number of emerging and resurgent human and veterinary infectious diseases. Traditional means of controlling arbovirus diseases include vaccination of susceptible vertebrates and mosquito control, but in many cases these have been unavailable or ineffective, and so novel strategies for disease control are needed. One possibility is genetic manipulation of mosquito vectors to render them unable to transmit arboviruses. This review describes recent work to test the concept of pathogen-derived resistance in arthropods by expression of viral genes in mosquito cell cultures and mosquitoes. Sense and antisense genome sequences from La Crosse virus (LAC) (a member of the Bunyaviridae) and dengue viruses serotypes 1 to 4 (DEN-1 to DEN-4) (members of the Flaviviridae) were expressed in mosquito cells from double-subgenomic and replicon vectors based on Sindbis virus (a member of the Togaviridae). The cells were then challenged with homologous or related viruses. For LAC, expression of antisense sequences from the small (S) genome segment, particularly full-length antisense S RNA, effectively interfered with replication of challenge virus, whereas expression of either antisense or sense RNA from the medium (M) segment was completely ineffective in LAC inhibition. Expression of sense and antisense RNA derived from certain regions of the DEN genome also blocked homologous virus replication more effectively than did RNA from other regions. Other parameters of RNA-mediated interference have been defined, such as the time when replication is blocked and the minimum size of effector RNA. The mechanism of RNA inhibition has not been determined, although it resembles double-stranded RNA interference in other nonvertebrate systems. Prospects for application of molecular strategies to control arbovirus diseases are briefly reviewed.

TI  - Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms Underlying Neurologic Manifestations of Mosquito-Borne Flavivirus Infections
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Flaviviruses are a family of enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome, transmitted by arthropod vectors. These viruses are known for their broad cellular tropism leading to infection of multiple body systems, which can include the central nervous system. Neurologic effects of flavivirus infection can arise during both acute and post-acute infectious periods; however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying post-acute sequelae are not fully understood. Here, we review recent studies that have examined molecular and cellular mechanisms that may contribute to neurologic sequelae following infection with the West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Zika virus, dengue virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus. Neuronal death, either from direct infection or due to the resultant inflammatory response, is a common mechanism by which flavivirus infection can lead to neurologic impairment. Other types of cellular damage, such as oxidative stress and DNA damage, appear to be more specific to certain viruses. This article aims to highlight mechanisms of cellular damage that are common across several flavivirus members and mechanisms that are more unique to specific members. Our goal is to inspire further research to improve understanding of this area in the hope of identifying treatment options for flavivirus-associated neurologic changes.

Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with DENV infections, an effective DENV vaccine and antiviral therapies are still missing. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the different steps of the DENV replication cycle, for example, genome replication and virus maturation, could help to develop such substances. Over the past several years, many important findings have been published with respect to a better understanding of DENV replication. In this review we will highlight recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of the viral replication cycle.

AB  - In this study, we provide a comprehensive molecular profiling of the involvement of T- helper (Th) genes during dengue virus infection of different cell types. The Th gene profiles of three human cell types (monocytes, T-cells and hepatocytes) were analyzed simultaneously via array-based RT-PCR upon infection with dengue virus. Differential regulation of 41 Th genes was identified and of which 20 of those genes may contribute to immuno-pathogenesis of dengue virus infection by regulating inflammation, thrombocytopenia and vascular permeability. Among the strongly up-regulated genes were the RANTES, CC-CKR3, IRF4, CLEC2C, IL-6 and TLR6, which are potent inducer of inflammation and vascular permeability. Profiling genes obtained from this study may serve as potential biomarkers and the modulation of Th immune responses during dengue virus infection has important implications in disease outcome.

TI  - Monitoring Mitochondrial Function in Aedes albopictus C6/36 Cell Line during Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Insects
VL  - 12
AB  - Simple Summary Dengue is an important and growing public health problem. To date, no specific therapeutic or effective prophylactic measures exist. Therefore, vector control remains the primary approach to prevent dengue virus (DENV) infection in humans. Recent findings highlight that viruses regulate mitochondrial function and dynamics to facilitate viral proliferation. In this study, we report that DENV infection modulates mitochondrial physiology in C6/36 mosquito cells. Our results revealed that DENV alters redox metabolism and mitochondrial membrane potential without any significant change in cellular ATP pool or viability. In addition, we observed preservation of the respiratory control ratio and translocation of mitofusins to mitochondria. These results suggest that mitochondrial fusion could be required for the maintenance of mitochondrial function in C6/36 mosquito cells infected with DENV. Abstract Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are responsible for dengue virus (DENV) transmission in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide, where an estimated 3 billion people live at risk of DENV exposure. DENV-infected individuals show symptoms ranging from sub-clinical or mild to hemorrhagic fever. Infected mosquitoes do not show detectable signs of disease, even though the virus maintains a lifelong persistent infection. The interactions between viruses and host mitochondria are crucial for virus replication and pathogenicity. DENV infection in vertebrate cells modulates mitochondrial function and dynamics to facilitate viral proliferation. Here, we describe that DENV also regulates mitochondrial function and morphology in infected C6/36 mosquito cells (derived from Aedes albopictus). Our results showed that DENV infection increased ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, modulated mitochondrial transmembrane potential and induced changes in mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, we offer the first evidence that DENV causes translocation of mitofusins to mitochondria in the C6/36 mosquito cell line. Another protein Drp-1 (Dynamin-related protein 1) did not localize to mitochondria in DENV-infected cells. This observation therefore ruled out the possibility that the abovementioned alterations in mitochondrial function are associated with mitochondrial fission. In summary, this report provides some key insights into the virus–mitochondria crosstalk in DENV infected mosquito cells.

TI  - Monocyte Recruitment to the Dermis and Differentiation to Dendritic Cells Increases the Targets for Dengue Virus Replication
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease in humans. Although Aedes mosquitoes transmit DENV when probing for blood in the skin, no information exists on DENV infection and immune response in the dermis, where the blood vessels are found. DENV suppresses the interferon response, replicates, and causes disease in humans but not wild-type mice. Here, we used mice lacking the interferon-α/β receptor (Ifnar –/–), which had normal cell populations in the skin and were susceptible to intradermal DENV infection, to investigate the dynamics of early DENV infection of immune cells in the skin. CD103+ classical dendritic cells (cDCs), Ly6C– CD11b+ cDCs, and macrophages in the steady-state dermis were initial targets of DENV infection 12-24 hours post-inoculation but then decreased in frequency. We demonstrated recruitment of adoptively-transferred Ly6Chigh monocytes from wild-type and Ifnar –/– origin to the DENV-infected dermis and differentiation to Ly6C+ CD11b+ monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), which became DENV-infected after 48 hours, and were then the major targets for virus replication. Ly6Chigh monocytes that entered the DENV-infected dermis expressed chemokine receptor CCR2, likely mediating recruitment. Further, we show that ∼100-fold more hematopoietic cells in the dermis were DENV-infected compared to Langerhans cells in the epidermis. Overall, these results identify the dermis as the main site of early DENV replication and show that DENV infection in the skin occurs in two waves: initial infection of resident cDCs and macrophages, followed by infection of monocytes and moDCs that are recruited to the dermis. Our study reveals a novel viral strategy of exploiting monocyte recruitment to increase the number of targets for infection at the site of invasion in the skin and highlights the skin as a potential site for therapeutic action or intradermal vaccination.

TI  - Monocytes, but not T or B cells, are the principal target cells for dengue virus (DV) infection among human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 80
AB  - A better understanding of the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome requires the precise identification of dengue virus (DV) permissive target cells. To examine the relative DV permissiveness among cell subsets, we inoculated unfractionated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with DV2‐16681 in the presence or absence of pooled DV‐immune human sera (PHS), and assessed infection with fluorescent dye labeled DV‐specific monoclonal antibody and cell surface markers using flow cytometry. We found significantly higher levels of DV antigen staining on DV‐infected than mock‐infected primary monocytes (3.54 ± 3.42% vs. 0.50 ± 0.38%; P = 0.001). The magnitude of infection was markedly enhanced in the presence of highly diluted PHS (10.04 ±  6.10% vs. 3.54 ± 3.42%; P = 0.015). Under identical experimental conditions, primary T or B cells were not infected either with or without the addition of PHS (0.06 ± 0.04% and 0.44 ± 0.22% for T and B cells, respectively). Furthermore, depletion of CD14+ monocytes prior to DV inoculation abrogated the detection of infected cells, and the addition of monoclonal antibodies to either FcγRI (CD64) or FcγRII (CD32) led to a 50–70% reduction in antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) of DV infection. Collectively, these results provide further support to the notion that primary monocytes and FcγRs expressed on these cells may be important in the initial steps of immune enhancement observed in some patients with natural DV infection. They also demonstrate that using modern experimental technology, DV infection, and neutralization and enhancement of DV infection can be easily assessed simultaneously in multiple cell types. J. Med.

TI  - Monomeric IgA Antagonizes IgG-Mediated Enhancement of DENV Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a prevalent human pathogen, infecting approximately 400 million individuals per year and causing symptomatic disease in approximately 100 million. A distinct feature of dengue is the increased risk for severe disease in some individuals with preexisting DENV-specific immunity. One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which poorly-neutralizing IgG antibodies from a prior infection opsonize DENV to increase infection of Fc gamma receptor-bearing cells. While IgM and IgG are the most commonly studied DENV-reactive antibody isotypes, our group and others have described the induction of DENV-specific serum IgA responses during dengue. We hypothesized that monomeric IgA would be able to neutralize DENV without the possibility of ADE. To test this, we synthesized IgG and IgA versions of two different DENV-reactive monoclonal antibodies. We demonstrate that isotype-switching does not affect the antigen binding and neutralization properties of the two mAbs. We show that DENV-reactive IgG, but not IgA, mediates ADE in an Fc gamma receptor-positive K562 cells. Furthermore, we show that IgA potently antagonizes the ADE activity of IgG. These results suggest that levels of serum DENV-reactive IgA induced by DENV infection might regulate the overall ADE activity of DENV-immune plasma in vivo and warrants further study as a predictor of disease risk and/or therapeutic.

JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 42
SP  - 11668
EP  - 11686
AB  - Dengue virus nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) is a multifunctional protein formed by a superfamily-2 RNA helicase linked to a protease domain. In this work, we report results from in vitro experiments designed to determine the oligomeric state of dengue virus NS3 helicase (NS3h) and to characterize fundamental properties of the interaction with single-stranded (ss)RNA. Pulsed field gradient-NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the effective hydrodynamic radius of NS3h, which was constant over a wide range of protein concentrations in the absence and presence of ssRNA. Size exclusion chromatography-static light scattering experiments showed that NS3h eluted as a monomeric molecule even in the presence of ssRNA. Binding of NS3h to ssRNA was studied by quantitative fluorescence titrations using fluorescein-labeled and unlabeled ssRNA oligonucleotides of different lengths, and the effect of the fluorescein label on the interaction parameters was also analyzed. Experimental results were well described by a statistical thermodynamic model based on the theory of non-specific interactions of large ligands to a one-dimensional lattice. We found that binding of NS3h to ssRNA oligonucleotides and to poly(A) is characterized by minimum and occluded binding site sizes both of 10 nucleotides and by a weak positive cooperativity between adjacent proteins.

TI  - Moonlighting glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is required for efficient hepatitis C virus and dengue virus infections in human Huh-7.5.1 cells.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 98 5
SP  - 977
EP  - 991
AB  - Hijacking of cellular biosynthetic pathways by human enveloped viruses is a shared molecular event essential for the viral lifecycle. In this study, the accumulating evidence of the importance of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the host secretory pathway led us to hypothesize that this moonlighting enzyme could play a key role in the lifecycle steps of two important Flaviviridae members, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and dengue virus (DENV). We used short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of human GAPDH in Huh-7.5.1 cells- both pre- and post-HCV infection- to demonstrate that GAPDH is a host factor for HCV infection. siRNA-induced GAPDH knockdown performed pre-HCV infection inhibits HCV core production in infected cells and leads to a decrease in infectivity of the HCV-infected cell supernatants. siRNA-induced GAPDH knockdown performed post-HCV infection does not have an effect on HCV core abundance in infected cells, but does lead to a decrease in infectivity of the HCV-infected cell supernatants. Exogenous expression of V5-tagged human GAPDH, pre- and post-infection, increases the infectivity of HCV-infected cell supernatants, suggesting a role for GAPDH during HCV post-replication steps. Interestingly, siRNA-induced GAPDH knockdown in HCV replicon-harbouring cells had no effect on viral RNA replication. Importantly, we confirmed the important role of GAPDH in the HCV lifecycle using Huh-7-derived stable GAPDH-knockdown clones. Finally, siRNA-induced GAPDH knockdown inhibits intracellular DENV-2 E glycoprotein production in infected cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that the moonlighting enzyme, GAPDH, is an important host factor for HCV infection, and they support its potential role in the DENV lifecycle.

TI  - Mosquito E-20-Monooxygenase Gene Knockout Increases Dengue Virus Replication in Aedes aegypti Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - E-20-monooxygenase (E20MO) is an enzymatic product of the shade (shd) locus (cytochrome p450, E20MO). Initially discovered in Drosophila, E20MO facilitates the conversion of ecdysone (E) into 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and is crucial for oogenesis. Prior research has implicated 20E in growth, development, and insecticide resistance. However, little attention has been given to the association between the E20MO gene and DENV2 infection. The transcriptome of Ae. aegypti cells (Aag2 cells) infected with DENV2 revealed the presence of the E20MO gene. The subsequent quantification of E20MO gene expression levels in Aag2 cells post-DENV infection was carried out. A CRISPR/Cas9 system was utilized to create an E20MO gene knockout cell line (KO), which was then subjected to DENV infection. Analyses of DENV2 copies in KO and wild-type (WT) cells were conducted at different days post-infection (dpi). Plasmids containing E20MO were constructed and transfected into KO cells, with pre- and post-transfection viral copy comparisons. Gene expression levels of E20MO increased after DENV infection. Subsequently, a successful generation of an E20MO gene knockout cell line and the verification of code-shifting mutations at both DNA and RNA levels were achieved. Furthermore, significantly elevated DENV2 RNA copies were observed in the mid-infection phase for the KO cell line. Viral RNA copies were lower in cells transfected with plasmids containing E20MO, compared to KO cells. Through knockout and plasmid complementation experiments in Aag2 cells, the role of E20MO in controlling DENV2 replication was demonstrated. These findings contribute to our understanding of the intricate biological interactions between mosquitoes and arboviruses.

JF  - Journal of Virology

SP  - 164
EP  - 175
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV), a flavivirus of global importance, is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. In this study, we developed in vitro and in vivo models of saliva-mediated enhancement of DENV infectivity. Serine protease activity in Aedes aegypti saliva augmented virus infectivity in vitro by proteolyzing extracellular matrix proteins, thereby increasing viral attachment to heparan sulfate proteoglycans and inducing cell migration. A serine protease inhibitor reduced saliva-mediated enhancement of DENV in vitro and in vivo, marked by a 100-fold reduction in DENV load in murine lymph nodes. A saliva-mediated infectivity enhancement screen of fractionated salivary gland extracts identified serine protease CLIPA3 as a putative cofactor, and short interfering RNA knockdown of CLIPA3 in mosquitoes demonstrated its role in influencing DENV infectivity. Molecules in mosquito saliva that facilitate viral infectivity in the vertebrate host provide novel targets that may aid in the prevention of disease.

TI  - Mosquito Salivary Proteins and Arbovirus Infection: From Viral Enhancers to Potential Targets for Vaccines
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses present important public health challenges worldwide. Viruses such as DENV, ZIKV, and WNV are of current concern due to an increasing incidence and an expanding geographic range, generating explosive outbreaks even in non-endemic areas. The clinical signs associated with infection from these arboviruses are often inapparent, mild, or nonspecific, but occasionally develop into serious complications marked by rapid onset, tremors, paralysis, hemorrhagic fever, neurological alterations, or death. They are predominately transmitted to humans through mosquito bite, during which saliva is inoculated into the skin to facilitate blood feeding. A new approach to prevent arboviral diseases has been proposed by the observation that arthropod saliva facilitates transmission of pathogens. Viruses released within mosquito saliva may more easily initiate host invasion by taking advantage of the host’s innate and adaptive immune responses to saliva. This provides a rationale for creating vaccines against mosquito salivary proteins, especially because of the lack of licensed vaccines against most of these viruses. This review aims to provide an overview of the effects on the host immune response by the mosquito salivary proteins and how these phenomena alter the infection outcome for different arboviruses, recent attempts to generate mosquito salivary-based vaccines against flavivirus including DENV, ZIKV, and WNV, and the potential benefits and pitfalls that this strategy involves.

JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - In mosquitoes, the interaction between the gut microbiota, the immune system, and the pathogens that these insects transmit to humans and animals is regarded as a key component toward the development of control strategies, aimed at reducing the burden of severe diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever. Indeed, different microorganisms from the mosquito microbiota have been investigated for their ability to affect important traits of the biology of the host insect, related with its survival, development and reproduction. Furthermore, some microorganisms have been shown to modulate the immune response of mosquito females, significantly shaping their vector competence. Here, we will review current knowledge in this field, focusing on i) the complex interaction between the intestinal microbiota and mosquito females defenses, both in the gut and at humoral level; ii) how knowledge on these issues contributes to the development of novel and targeted strategies for the control of mosquito-borne diseases such as the use of paratransgenesis or taking advantage of the relationship between Wolbachia and mosquito hosts. We conclude by providing a brief overview of available knowledge on microbiota-immune system interplay in major insect vectors.

TI  - Mosquito antiviral defense mechanisms: a delicate balance between innate immunity and persistent viral infection
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 12
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases are associated with major global health burdens. Aedes spp. and Culex spp. are primarily responsible for the transmission of the most medically important mosquito-borne viruses, including dengue virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus. Despite the burden of these pathogens on human populations, the interactions between viruses and their mosquito hosts remain enigmatic. Viruses enter the midgut of a mosquito following the mosquito’s ingestion of a viremic blood meal. During infection, virus recognition by the mosquito host triggers their antiviral defense mechanism. Of these host defenses, activation of the RNAi pathway is the main antiviral mechanism, leading to the degradation of viral RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication and promoting viral clearance. However, whilst antiviral host defense mechanisms limit viral replication, the mosquito immune system is unable to effectively clear the virus. As such, these viruses can establish persistent infection with little or no fitness cost to the mosquito vector, ensuring life-long transmission to humans. Understanding of the mosquito innate immune response enables the discovery of novel antivectorial strategies to block human transmission. This review provides an updated and concise summary of recent studies on mosquito antiviral immune responses, which is a key determinant for successful virus transmission. In addition, we will also discuss the factors that may contribute to persistent infection in mosquito hosts. Finally, we will discuss current mosquito transmission-blocking strategies that utilize genetically modified mosquitoes and Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes for resistance to pathogens.

TI  - Mosquito immune cells enhance dengue and Zika virus dissemination in Aedes aegypti
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Mosquito-borne viruses cause more than 400 million annual infections and place over half of the world’s population at risk. Despite this importance, the mechanisms by which arboviruses infect the mosquito host and disseminate to tissues required for transmission are not well understood. Here, we provide evidence that mosquito immune cells, known as hemocytes, play an integral role in the dissemination of dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. We establish that phagocytic hemocytes are a focal point for virus infection and demonstrate that these immune cell populations facilitate virus dissemination to the ovaries and salivary glands. Additional transfer experiments confirm that virus-infected hemocytes confer a virus infection to non-infected mosquitoes more efficiently than free virus in acellular hemolymph, revealing that hemocytes are an important tropism to enhance virus dissemination in the mosquito host. These data support a “trojan horse” model of virus dissemination where infected hemocytes transport virus through the hemolymph to deliver virus to mosquito tissues required for transmission and parallels vertebrate systems where immune cell populations promote virus dissemination to secondary sites of infection. In summary, this study significantly advances our understanding of virus infection dynamics in mosquitoes and highlights conserved roles of immune cells in virus dissemination across vertebrate and invertebrate systems.

TI  - Mosquito metabolomics reveal that dengue virus replication requires phospholipid reconfiguration via the remodeling cycle
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 117
SP  - 27627
EP  - 27636
AB  - Significance Dengue virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and threatens more than half of the world population. In the absence of an effective vaccine and therapeutics and with a declining efficacy of insecticide, there is an urgent need to develop novel interventions. Here, we deployed an approach that combines metabolomics with molecular biology in mosquitoes. We revealed that dengue virus reconfigures the endomembrane phospholipids to form the structures required for its replication by activating the phospholipid remodeling cycle. We showed that a blood component that initiates de novo phospholipid production decreases mosquito infection. Overall, we revealed how and why dengue virus reconfigures phospholipids in mosquitoes. This understanding highlights intervention targets. Dengue virus (DENV) subdues cell membranes for its cellular cycle by reconfiguring phospholipids in humans and mosquitoes. Here, we determined how and why DENV reconfigures phospholipids in the mosquito vector. By inhibiting and activating the de novo phospholipid biosynthesis, we demonstrated the antiviral impact of de novo–produced phospholipids. In line with the virus hijacking lipids for its benefit, metabolomics analyses indicated that DENV actively inhibited the de novo phospholipid pathway and instead triggered phospholipid remodeling. We demonstrated the early induction of remodeling during infection by using isotope tracing in mosquito cells. We then confirmed in mosquitoes the antiviral impact of de novo phospholipids by supplementing infectious blood meals with a de novo phospholipid precursor. Eventually, we determined that phospholipid reconfiguration was required for viral genome replication but not for the other steps of the virus cellular cycle. Overall, we now propose that DENV reconfigures phospholipids through the remodeling cycle to modify the endomembrane and facilitate formation of the replication complex. Furthermore, our study identified de novo phospholipid precursor as a blood determinant of DENV human-to-mosquito transmission.

VL  - 13 8

AB  - Many arboviral proteins are phosphorylated in infected mammalian cells, but it is unknown if the same phosphorylation events occur when insects are similarly infected. One of the mammalian kinases responsible for phosphorylation, protein kinase G (PKG), has been implicated in the behavior of multiple nonvector insects, but is unstudied in mosquitoes. PKG from Aedes aegypti was cloned, and phosphorylation of specific viral sites was monitored by mass spectrometry from biochemical and cell culture experiments. PKG from Aedes mosquitoes is able to phosphorylate dengue nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) at specific sites in cell culture and cell-free systems and autophosphorylates its own regulatory domain in a cell-free system. Injecting Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes with a pharmacological PKG activator resulted in increased Aedes wing activity during periods of their natural diurnal/crepuscular activity and increased Anopheles nocturnal locomotor/flight activity. Thus, perturbation of the PKG signaling pathway in mosquitoes alters flight behavior. The demonstrated effect of PKG alterations is consistent with a viral PKG substrate triggering increased PKG activity. This increased PKG activity could be the mechanism by which dengue virus increases flight behavior and possibly facilitates transmission. Whether or not PKG is part of the mechanism by which dengue increases flight behavior, this report is the first to show PKG can modulate behavior in hematophagous disease vectors.

TI  - Mosquito-Borne Diseases and Omics: Salivary Gland Proteome of the Female Aedes aegypti Mosquito.
JF  - Omics : a journal of integrative biology
VL  - 21 1
SP  - 45
EP  - 54
AB  - The female Aedes aegypti mosquito is an important vector for several tropical and subtropical diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika and yellow fever. The disease viruses infect the mosquito and subsequently spread to the salivary glands after which the viruses can be transmitted to humans with probing or feeding by the mosquito. Omics systems sciences offer the opportunity to characterize vectors and can inform disease surveillance, vector control and development of innovative diagnostics, personalized medicines, vaccines, and insecticide targets. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we performed an analysis of the A. aegypti salivary gland proteome. The A. aegypti proteome resulted in acquisition of 83,836 spectra. Upon searches against the protein database of the A. aegypti, these spectra were assigned to 5417 unique peptides, belonging to 1208 proteins. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest set of proteins identified in the A. aegypti salivary gland. Of note, 29 proteins were involved in immunity-related pathways in salivary glands. A subset of these proteins is known to interact with disease viruses. Another 15 proteins with signal cleavage site were found to be secretory in nature, and thus possibly playing critical roles in blood meal ingestion. These findings provide a baseline to advance our understanding of vector-borne diseases and vector-pathogen interactions before virus transmission in global health, and might therefore enable future design and development of virus-blocking strategies and novel molecular targets in the mosquito vector A. aegypti.

TI  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses and type I interferon: catch me if you can!
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 14
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses include many viruses that are important human pathogens, including Yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, Zika virus and West Nile virus. While these viruses have long been confined to tropical regions, they now pose a global public health concern, as the geographical distribution of their mosquito vectors has dramatically expanded. The constant threat of flavivirus emergence and re-emergence underlines the need for a better understanding of the relationships between these viruses and their hosts. In particular, unraveling how these viruses manage to bypass antiviral immune mechanisms could enable the design of countermeasures to limit their impact on human health. The body’s first line of defense against viral infections is provided by the interferon (IFN) response. This antiviral defense mechanism takes place in two waves, namely the induction of type I IFNs triggered by viral infection, followed by the IFN signaling pathway, which leads to the synthesis of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), whose products inhibit viral replication. In order to spread throughout the body, viruses must race against time to replicate before this IFN-induced antiviral state hinders their dissemination. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge on the multiple strategies developed by mosquito-borne flaviviruses to interfere with innate immune detection and signaling pathways, in order to delay, if not prevent, the establishment of an antiviral response.

EP  - 1089
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses such as dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus pose a threat to half of the world population and are a serious public health challenge in many developing countries. There are no effective vaccines or antivirals for most of these viruses. Viruses, being obligate parasites, hijack host pathways for efficient replication and therefore each step of viral life-cycle, namely entry into the host cell, genome replication, assembly and exit, requires the participation of host factors. Investigating the biology of mosquito-borne flaviviruses and the complex interplay of virus with its host will help in identifying drug targets and also in developing safer vaccines and antivirals. This article provides insights into the recent developments in our understanding of the virus–host interactions at various steps in the life-cycle of these viruses.

TI  - Mosquito‐infecting virus Espirito Santo virus inhibits replication and spread of dengue virus
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 93
SP  - 3362
EP  - 3373
AB  - The primary vector of dengue virus (DENV) is Aedes aegypti. The mosquito‐infecting virus, Espirito Santo virus (ESV), does not infect Vero (mammalian) cells and grows in mosquito (C6/36) cells without cytopathic effects. Effects of ESV infection on replication of DENV were explored in vitro and in vivo, analyzing protein, RNA genome expression, and plaque formation. ESV and DENV simultaneous coinfection did not block protein synthesis from either virus but did result in inhibition of DENV replication in mosquito cells. Furthermore, ESV superinfected with DENV resulted in inhibition of DENV replication and spread in A. aegypti, thus reducing vector competence. Tissue culture experiments on viral kinetics of ESV and DENV coinfection showed that neither virus significantly affects the replication of the other in Vero, HeLa, or HEK cells. Hence, ESV blocks DENV replication in insect cells, but not the mammalian cells evaluated here. Our study provides new insights into ESV‐induced suppression of DENV, a globally important pathogen impacting public health.

TI  - Mother-to-Child Transmission of Arboviruses during Breastfeeding: From Epidemiology to Cellular Mechanisms
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Most viruses use several entry sites and modes of transmission to infect their host (parenteral, sexual, respiratory, oro-fecal, transplacental, transcutaneous, etc.). Some of them are known to be essentially transmitted via arthropod bites (mosquitoes, ticks, phlebotomes, sandflies, etc.), and are thus named arthropod-borne viruses, or arboviruses. During the last decades, several arboviruses have emerged or re-emerged in different countries in the form of notable outbreaks, resulting in a growing interest from scientific and medical communities as well as an increase in epidemiological studies. These studies have highlighted the existence of other modes of transmission. Among them, mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) during breastfeeding was highlighted for the vaccine strain of yellow fever virus (YFV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), and suggested for other arboviruses such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV). In this review, we summarize all epidemiological and clinical clues that suggest the existence of breastfeeding as a neglected route for MTCT of arboviruses and we decipher some of the mechanisms that chronologically occur during MTCT via breastfeeding by focusing on ZIKV transmission process.

TI  - Motif V regulates energy transduction between the flavivirus NS3 ATPase and RNA-binding cleft
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 295
SP  - 1551
EP  - 1564
AB  - The unwinding of dsRNA intermediates is critical for the replication of flavivirus RNA genomes. This activity is provided by the C-terminal helicase domain of viral nonstructural protein 3 (NS3). As a member of the superfamily 2 (SF2) helicases, NS3 requires the binding and hydrolysis of ATP/NTP to translocate along and unwind double-stranded nucleic acids. However, the mechanism of energy transduction between the ATP- and RNA-binding pockets is not well-understood. Previous molecular dynamics simulations conducted by our group have identified Motif V as a potential “communication hub” for this energy transduction pathway. To investigate the role of Motif V in this process, here we combined molecular dynamics, biochemistry, and virology approaches. We tested Motif V mutations in both the replicon and recombinant protein systems to investigate viral genome replication, RNA-binding affinity, ATP hydrolysis activity, and helicase-mediated unwinding activity. We found that the T407A and S411A substitutions in NS3 reduce viral replication and increase the helicase-unwinding turnover rates by 1.7- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting that flaviviruses may use suboptimal NS3 helicase activity for optimal genome replication. Additionally, we used simulations of each mutant to probe structural changes within NS3 caused by each mutation. These simulations indicate that Motif V controls communication between the ATP-binding pocket and the helical gate. These results help define the linkage between ATP hydrolysis and helicase activities within NS3 and provide insight into the biophysical mechanisms for ATPase-driven NS3 helicase function.

TI  - Mucin Protein of Aedes aegypti Interacts with Dengue Virus 2 and Influences Viral Infection
JF  - Microbiology Spectrum
VL  - 11
AB  - Identification of interacting protein partners of DENV in the insect vector Aedes aegypti is crucial for designing vector control-based strategies and for understanding the molecular mechanism DENV uses to modulate the host, gain entry, and survive successfully. Similar proteins can be used in generating transmission-blocking vaccines. ABSTRACT Dengue, caused by dengue virus (DENV), is the most prevalent vector-borne viral disease, posing a serious health concern to 2.5 billion people worldwide. DENV is primarily transmitted among humans by its mosquito vector Aedes aegypti; hence, the identification of a novel dengue virus receptor in mosquitoes is critical for the development of new anti-mosquito measures. In the current study, we have identified peptides which potentially interact with the surface of the virion particles and facilitate virus infection and movement during their life cycle in the mosquito vector. To identify these candidate proteins, we performed phage-display library screening against domain III of the envelope protein (EDIII), which plays an essential role during host cell receptor binding for viral entry. The mucin protein, which shared sequence similarity with the peptide identified in the screening, was cloned, expressed, and purified for in vitro interaction studies. Using in vitro pulldown and virus overlay protein-binding assay (VOPBA), we confirmed the positive interaction of mucin with purified EDIII and whole virion particles. Finally, blocking of mucin protein with anti-mucin antibodies partially reduced DENV titers in infected mosquitos. Moreover, mucin protein was found to be localized in the midgut of Ae. aegypti. IMPORTANCE Identification of interacting protein partners of DENV in the insect vector Aedes aegypti is crucial for designing vector control-based strategies and for understanding the molecular mechanism DENV uses to modulate the host, gain entry, and survive successfully. Similar proteins can be used in generating transmission-blocking vaccines.

TI  - Multifaceted contributions of Dicer2 to arbovirus transmission by Aedes aegypti
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are an increasing threat to global health. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway is considered the main antiviral immune pathway of insects, and thus represents a potential key target in the development of novel transmission-blocking strategies against arboviruses. Although the antiviral function of the siRNA pathway in Ae. aegypti is well established, its effective impact on arbovirus transmission is surprisingly poorly understood. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to create a line of Ae. aegypti in which we mutated Dicer2, a gene encoding the RNA sensor and key component of the siRNA pathway. Our Dicer2 null mutant line is viable and fertile, and only displays minor fitness defects despite being unable to produce siRNAs. The loss of Dicer2 affects early viral replication and systemic viral dissemination of four medically significant arboviruses (chikungunya, Mayaro, dengue, and Zika viruses) representing two viral families. However, measures of virus transmission potential indicate that Dicer2 null mutants and wild-type mosquitoes display an overall similar level of vector competence. Additionally, Dicer2 null mutants undergo significant virus-induced mortality during infection with chikungunya virus, but not dengue virus. Together, our results define a multifaceted role for Dicer2 in the transmission of arboviruses by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and pave the way for further mechanistic investigations.

TI  - Multifaceted functional implications of an endogenously expressed tRNA fragment in the vector mosquito Aedes aegypti
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 12
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of human arboviral diseases caused by dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. Many studies have shown the potential roles of small RNA molecules such as microRNA, small interfering RNA and PIWI-interacting RNA in vector mosquitoes. The function of tRNA fragments (tRF), the newly discovered class of small RNAs, in mosquitoes is not known. In this study, we show that specific tRFs are expressed in significantly differential manner between males and females of Ae. aegypti strains. Specific tRFs also show differential response during developmental transition from larvae to adults, as well as after blood feeding of adult females. The expression pattern of tRFs upon blood feeding varied depending upon if the blood contained dengue virus, and also if the females were treated with antibiotic prior to feeding to cleanse of the gut bacteria. Our findings show that a single tRF derived from the precursor sequences of a tRNA-Gly was differentially expressed between males and females, developmental transitions and also upon blood feeding by females of two laboratory strains that vary in midgut susceptibility to dengue virus infection. The multifaceted functional implications of this specific tRF suggest that biogenesis of small regulatory molecules from a tRNA can have wide ranging effects on key aspects of Ae. aegypti vector biology.

TI  - Multiple Wolbachia strains provide comparative levels of protection against dengue virus infection in Aedes aegypti
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - The insect bacterium Wolbachia pipientis is being introgressed into Aedes aegypti populations as an intervention against the transmission of medically important arboviruses. Here we compare Ae. aegypti mosquitoes infected with wMelCS or wAlbB to the widely used wMel Wolbachia strain on an Australian nuclear genetic background for their susceptibility to infection by dengue virus (DENV) genotypes spanning all four serotypes. All Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes were more resistant to intrathoracic DENV challenge than their wildtype counterparts. Blocking of DENV replication was greatest by wMelCS. Conversely, wAlbB-infected mosquitoes were more susceptible to whole body infection than wMel and wMelCS. We extended these findings via mosquito oral feeding experiments, using viremic blood from 36 acute, hospitalised dengue cases in Vietnam, additionally including wMel and wildtype mosquitoes on a Vietnamese nuclear genetic background. As above, wAlbB was less effective at blocking DENV replication in the abdomen compared to wMel and wMelCS. The transmission potential of all Wolbachia-infected mosquito lines (measured by the presence/absence of infectious DENV in mosquito saliva) after 14 days, was significantly reduced compared to their wildtype counterparts, and lowest for wMelCS and wAlbB. These data support the use of wAlbB and wMelCS strains for introgression field trials and the biocontrol of DENV transmission. Furthermore, despite observing significant differences in transmission potential between wildtype mosquitoes from Australia and Vietnam, no difference was observed between wMel-infected mosquitoes from each background suggesting that Wolbachia may override any underlying variation in DENV transmission potential.

AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) have 5'-capped RNA genomes of (+) polarity and encode a single polyprotein precursor that is processed into mature viral proteins. NS2B, NS3 and NS5 proteins catalyse/activate enzyme activities that are required for key processes in the virus life cycle. The heterodimeric NS2B/NS3 is a serine protease required for processing. Using a high-throughput protease assay, we screened a small molecule chemical library and identified -200 compounds having > or = 50% inhibition. Moreover, NS3 exhibits RNA-stimulated NTPase, RNA helicase and the 5'-RNA triphosphatase activities. The NTPase and the 5'-RTPase activities of NS3 are stimulated by interaction with NS5. Moreover, the conserved, positively charged motif in DENV-2 NS3, 184RKRK, is required for RNA binding and modulates the RNA-dependent enzyme activities of NS3. To study viral replication, a variety of methods are used such as the in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assays that utilize lysates from DENV-2-infected mosquito or mammalian cells or the purified NS5 along with exogenous short subgenomic viral RNAs or the replicative intracellular membrane-bound viral RNAs as templates. In addition, a cell-based DENV-2 replicon RNA encoding a luciferase reporter is also used to examine the role of cis-acting elements within the 3' UTR and the RKRK motif in viral replication.

EP  - 64
AB  - During infection, the capsid (C) protein of many flaviviruses localizes to the nuclei and nucleoli of several infected cell lines; the underlying basis and significance of C protein nuclear localization remain poorly understood. In this study, double alanine-substitution mutations were introduced into three previously proposed nuclear-localization signals (at positions 6-9, 73-76 and 85-100) of dengue virus C protein, and four viable mutants, c(K6A,K7A), c(K73A,K74A), c(R85A,K86A) and c(R97A,R98A), were generated in a mosquito cell line in which C protein nuclear localization was rarely observed. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis revealed that, whilst C protein was present in the nuclei of PS and Vero cells throughout infection with a dengue serotype 2 parent virus, the substitution mutations in c(K73A,K74A) and c(R85A,K86A) resulted in an elimination of nuclear localization in PS cells and marked reduction in Vero cells. Mutants c(K6A,K7A) and c(R97A,R98A) exhibited reduced nuclear localization at the late period of infection in PS cells only. All four mutants displayed reduced replication in PS, Vero and C6/36 cells, but there was a lack of correlation between nuclear localization and viral growth properties. Distinct dibasic residues within dengue virus C protein, many of which were located on the solvent-exposed side of the C protein homodimer, contribute to its ability to localize to nuclei during virus infection.

JF  - Journal of Virology

EP  - 6546
AB  - The target epitopes, serotype specificity, and cytolytic function of dengue virus-specific T cells may influence their theoretical roles in protection against secondary infection as well as the immunopathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever. To study these factors in an experimental system, we isolated dengue virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell clones from dengue-2 virus-immunized BALB/c mice. The T-cell response to dengue virus in this mouse strain was heterogeneous; we identified at least five different CD4+ phenotypes and six different CD8+ phenotypes. Individual T-cell clones recognized epitopes on the dengue virus pre-M, E, NSl/NS2A, and NS3 proteins and were restricted by the I-Ad, I-Ed, Ld, and Kd antigens. Both serotype-specific and serotype-cross-reactive clones were isolated in the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets; among CD8+ clones, those that recognized the dengue virus structural proteins were serotype specific whereas those that recognized the nonstructural proteins were serotype cross-reactive. All of the CD8+ and one of five CD4+ clones lysed dengue virus-infected target cells. Using synthetic peptides, we identified an Ld-restricted epitope on the E protein (residues 331 to 339, SPCKIPFEI) and a Kd-restricted epitope on the NS3 protein (residues 296 to 310, ARGYISTRVEM GEAA). These data parallel previous findings of studies using human dengue virus-specific T-cell clones. This experimental mouse system may be useful for studying the role of the virus serotype and HLA haplotype on T-cell responses after primary dengue virus infection.

TI  - Multiploid CD61+ Cells Are the Pre-Dominant Cell Lineage Infected during Acute Dengue Virus Infection in Bone Marrow
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Depression of the peripheral blood platelet count during acute infection is a hallmark of dengue. This thrombocytopenia has been attributed, in part, to an insufficient level of platelet production by megakaryocytes that reside in the bone marrow (BM). Interestingly, it was observed that dengue patients experience BM suppression at the onset of fever. However, few studies focus on the interaction between dengue virus (DENV) and megakaryocytes and how this interaction can lead to a reduction in platelets. In the studies reported herein, BM cells from normal healthy rhesus monkeys (RM) and humans were utilized to identify the cell lineage(s) that were capable of supporting virus infection and replication. A number of techniques were employed in efforts to address this issue. These included the use of viral RNA quantification, nonstructural protein and infectivity assays, phenotypic studies utilizing immunohistochemical staining, anti-differentiation DEAB treatment, and electron microscopy. Cumulative results from these studies revealed that cells in the BM were indeed highly permissive for DENV infection, with human BM having higher levels of viral production compared to RM. DENV-like particles were predominantly observed in multi-nucleated cells that expressed CD61+. These data suggest that megakaryocytes are likely the predominant cell type infected by DENV in BM, which provides one explanation for the thrombocytopenia and the dysfunctional platelets characteristic of dengue virus infection.

TI  - Mutagenesis of Dengue Virus Protein NS2A Revealed a Novel Domain Responsible for Virus-Induced Cytopathic Effect and Interactions between NS2A and NS2B Transmembrane Segments
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT The NS2A protein of dengue virus (DENV) has eight predicted transmembrane segments (pTMS1 to -8) and participates in RNA replication, virion assembly, and host antiviral response. However, the roles of specific amino acid residues within the pTMS regions of NS2A during the viral life cycle are not clear. Here, we explore the function of DENV NS2A by introducing a series of alanine substitutions into the N-terminal half (pTMS1 to -4) of the protein in the context of a DENV infectious clone or subgenomic replicon. Six NS2A mutants (NM5, -7, -9, and -17 to -19) around pTMS1 and -2 displayed a novel phenotype showing a >1,000-fold reduction in virus yield, an absence of plaque formation despite wild-type-like replicon activity, and infectious-virus-like particle yields. HEK-293 cells infected with the six NS2A mutant viruses failed to cause a virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) by MitoCapture staining, cell proliferation, and lactate dehydrogenase release assays. Sequencing analyses of pseudorevertant viruses derived from lethal-mutant viruses revealed two consensus reversion mutations, leucine to phenylalanine at codon 181 (L181F) within pTMS7 of NS2A and isoleucine to threonine at codon 114 (I114T) within NS2B. The introduction of an NS2A-L181F mutation into the lethal (NM15, -16, -25, and -33) and CPE-defective (NM7, -9, and -19) mutants substantially rescued virus infectivity and virus-induced CPE, respectively, whereas the NS2B-L114T mutation rescued the NM16, -25, and -33 mutants. In conclusion, the results revealed the essential roles of the N-terminal half of NS2A in RNA replication and virus-induced CPE. Intramolecular interactions between pTMSs of NS2A and intermolecular interactions between the NS2A and NS2B proteins were also implicated. IMPORTANCE The characterization of the N-terminal (current study) and C-terminal halves of DENV NS2A is the most comprehensive mutagenesis study to date to investigate the function of NS2A during the flaviviral life cycle. A novel region responsible for virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) within pTMS1 and -2 of DENV NS2A was identified. Revertant genetics studies implied unexpected relationships between various pTMSs of DENV NS2A and NS2B. These results provide comprehensive information regarding the functions of DENV NS2A and the specific amino acids and transmembrane segments responsible for these functions. The positions and properties of the rescuing mutations were also revealed, providing important clues regarding the manner in which intramolecular or intermolecular interactions between the pTMSs of NS2A and NS2B regulate virus replication, assembly/secretion, and virus-induced CPE. These results expand the understanding of flavivirus replication. The knowledge may also facilitate studies of pathogenesis and novel vaccine and antiflaviviral drug development.

TI  - Mutagenesis of the DI/DIII Linker in Dengue Virus Envelope Protein Impairs Viral Particle Assembly
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 7072
EP  - 7083
AB  - ABSTRACT The dengue virus (DV) envelope (E) protein is important in mediating viral entry and assembly of progeny virus during cellular infection. Domains I and III (DI and DIII, respectively) of the DV E protein are connected by a highly conserved but poorly ordered region, the DI/DIII linker. Although the flexibility of the DI/DIII linker is thought to be important for accommodating the structural rearrangements undergone by the E protein during viral entry, the function of the linker in the DV infectious cycle is not well understood. In this study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on conserved residues in the DI/DIII linker of the DV2 E protein and showed that the resulting mutations had little or no effect on the entry process but greatly affected virus assembly. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy experiments performed on infectious virus as well as in a virus-like particle (VLP) system indicate that the DI/DIII linker mutants express the DV structural proteins at the sites of particle assembly near the ER but fail to form infectious particles. This defect is not due to disruption of E's interaction with prM and pr in immature and mature virions, respectively. Serial passaging of the DV2 mutant E-Y299F led to the identification of a mutation in the membrane-proximal stem region of E that fully compensates for the assembly defect of this DI/DIII linker mutant. Together, our results suggest a critical and previously unidentified role for the E protein DI/DIII linker region during the DV2 assembly process.

TI  - Mutagenesis of the Dengue Virus Type 2 NS3 Protein within and outside Helicase Motifs: Effects on Enzyme Activity and Virus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 75
SP  - 9633
EP  - 9643
AB  - ABSTRACT The protein NS3 of Dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2) is the second largest nonstructural protein specified by the virus and is known to possess multiple enzymatic activities, including a serine proteinase located in the N-terminal region and an NTPase-helicase in the remaining 70% of the protein. The latter region has seven conserved helicase motifs found in all members of the family Flaviviridae. DEN-2 NS3 lacking the proteinase region was synthesized as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli. The effects of 10 mutations on ATPase and RNA helicase activity were examined. Residues at four sites within enzyme motifs I, II, and VI were substituted, and six sites outside motifs were altered by clustered charged-to-alanine mutagenesis. The mutations were also tested for their effects on virus replication by incorporation into genomic-length cDNA. Two mutations, both in motif I (G198A and K199A) abolished both ATPase and helicase activity. Two further mutations, one in motif VI (R457A,R458A) and the other a clustered charged-to-alanine substitution at R376KNGK380, abolished helicase activity only. No virus was detected for any mutation which prevented helicase activity, demonstrating the requirement of this enzyme for virus replication. The remaining six mutations resulted in various levels of enzyme activities, and four permitted virus replication. For the two nonreplicating viruses encoding clustered changes at R184KR186 and D436GEE439, we propose that the substituted residues are surface located and that the viruses are defective through altered interaction of NS3 with other components of the viral replication complex. Two of the replicating viruses displayed a temperature-sensitive phenotype. One contained a clustered mutation at D334EE336 and grew too poorly for further characterization. However, virus with an M283F substitution in motif II was examined in a temperature shift experiment (33 to 37°C) and showed reduced RNA synthesis at the higher temperature.

AB  - The N-terminal one-third of the NS3 protein of Dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2) complexes with co-factor NS2B to form an active serine proteinase which cleaves the viral polyprotein. To identify sites within NS3 that may interact with NS2B, seven regions within the NS3 proteinase outside the conserved flavivirus enzyme motifs were mutated by alanine replacement. Five sites contained clusters of charged residues and were hydrophilic. Two sites were hydrophobic and highly conserved among flaviviruses. The effects of five mutations on NS2B/3 processing were examined using a COS cell expression system. Four retained significant proteinase activity. Three of these mutations and two more were introduced into genomic-length cDNA and tested for their effects on virus replication. The five mutant viruses showed reduced plaque size and two of the five showed significantly reduced titres. All seven mutations were mapped on the X-ray crystal structure of the DEN-2 NS3 proteinase: three were located at the N terminus and two at the C terminus of the NS2B-binding cleft. Two mutations were at the C terminus of the proteinase domain and one was solvent-exposed. The study demonstrated that charged-to-alanine mutagenesis in the viral proteinase can be used to produce growth-restricted flaviviruses that may be useful in the production of attenuated vaccine strains.

TI  - Mutation of Putative N-Glycosylation Sites on Dengue Virus NS4B Decreases RNA Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 6746
EP  - 6760
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-associated protein, and mutagenesis studies have revealed its significance in viral genome replication. In this work, we demonstrated that NS4B is an N-glycosylated protein in virus-infected cells as well as in recombinant protein expression. NS4B is N glycosylated at residues 58 and 62 and exists in two forms, glycosylated and unglycosylated. We manipulated full-length infectious RNA clones and subgenomic replicons to generate N58Q, N62Q, and N58QN62Q mutants. Each of the single mutants had distinct effects, but the N58QN62Q mutation resulted in dramatic reduction of viral production efficiency without affecting secretion or infectivity of the virion in mammalian and mosquito C6/36 hosts. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), subgenomic replicon, and trans-complementation assays indicated that the N58QN62Q mutation affected RNA replication possibly by the loss of glycans. In addition, four intragenic mutations (S59Y, S59F, T66A, and A137T) were obtained from mammalian and/or mosquito C6/36 cell culture systems. All of these second-site mutations compensated for the replication defect of the N58QN62Q mutant without creating novel glycosylation sites. In vivo protein stability analyses revealed that the N58QN62Q mutation alone or plus a compensatory mutation did not affect the stability of NS4B. Overall, our findings indicated that mutation of putative N-glycosylation sites affected the biological function of NS4B in the viral replication complex. IMPORTANCE This is the first report to identify and reveal the biological significance of dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) posttranslation N-glycosylation to the virus life cycle. The study demonstrated that NS4B is N glycosylated in virus-infected cells and in recombinant protein expression. NS4B is modified by glycans at Asn-58 and Asn-62. Functional characterization implied that DENV NS4B utilizes the glycosylation machinery in both mammalian and mosquito hosts. Four intragenic mutations were found to compensate for replication and subsequent viral production deficiencies without creating novel N-glycosylation sites or modulating the stabilities of the protein, suggesting that glycans may be involved in maintaining the NS4B protein conformation. NS4B glycans may be necessary elements of the viral life cycle, but compensatory mutations can circumvent their requirement. This novel finding may have broader implications in flaviviral biology as the most likely glycan at Asn-62 of NS4B is conserved in DENV serotypes and in some related flaviviruses.

TI  - Mutational Evidence for an Internal Fusion Peptide in Flavivirus Envelope Protein E
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 75
SP  - 4268
EP  - 4275
AB  - ABSTRACT The envelope protein E of the flavivirus tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus promotes cell entry by inducing fusion of the viral membrane with an intracellular membrane after uptake by endocytosis. This protein differs from other well-studied viral and cellular fusion proteins because of its distinct molecular architecture and apparent lack of involvement of coiled coils in the low-pH-induced structural transitions that lead to fusion. A highly conserved loop (the cd loop), which resides at the distal tip of each subunit and is mostly buried in the subunit interface of the native E homodimer at neutral pH, has been hypothesized to function as an internal fusion peptide at low pH, but this has not yet been shown experimentally. It was predicted by examination of the X-ray crystal structure of the TBE virus E protein (F. A. Rey et al., Nature 375:291–298, 1995) that mutations at a specific residue within this loop (Leu 107) would not cause the native structure to be disrupted. We therefore introduced amino acid substitutions at this position and, using recombinant subviral particles, investigated the effects of these changes on fusion and related properties. Replacement of Leu with hydrophilic amino acids strongly impaired (Thr) or abolished (Asp) fusion activity, whereas a Phe mutant still retained a significant degree of fusion activity. Liposome coflotation experiments showed that the fusion-negative Asp mutant did not form a stable interaction with membranes at low pH, although it was still capable of undergoing the structural rearrangements required for fusion. These data support the hypothesis that the cd loop may be directly involved in interactions with target membranes during fusion.

TI  - Mutational analysis of the octapeptide sequence motif at the NS1-NS2A cleavage junction of dengue type 4 virus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 66
SP  - 7225
EP  - 7231
AB  - We have previously shown that proper processing of dengue type 4 virus NS1 from the NS1-NS2A region of the viral polyprotein requires a hydrophobic N-terminal signal and the downstream NS2A. Results from deletion analysis indicate that a minimum length of eight amino acids at the C terminus of NS1 is required for cleavage at the NS1-NS2A junction. Comparison of this eight-amino-acid sequence with the corresponding sequences of other flaviviruses suggests a consensus cleavage sequence of Met/Leu-Val-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Val-Xaa-Ala. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to construct mutants of NS1-NS2A that contained a single amino acid substitution at different positions of the consensus cleavage sequence or at the immediate downstream position. Three to eight different substitutions were made at each position. A total of 50 NS1-NS2A mutants were analyzed for their cleavage efficiency relative to that of the wild-type dengue type 4 virus sequence. As predicted, nearly all substitutions at positions P1, P3, P5, P7, and P8, occupied by conserved amino acids, yielded low levels of cleavage, with the exception that Pro or Ala substituting for Ser (P5) was tolerated. Substitutions of an amino acid at the remaining positions occupied by nonconserved amino acids generally yielded high levels of cleavage. However, some substitutions at nonconserved positions were not tolerated. For example, substitution of Gly or Glu for Gln (P4) and substitution of Val or Glu for Lys (P6) each yielded a low level of cleavage. Overall, these data support the proposed cleavage sequence motif deduced by comparison of sequences among the flaviviruses. This study also showed that in addition to the eight-amino-acid sequence, the amino acid immediately following the NS1-NS2A cleavage site plays a role in cleavage.

TI  - Mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of dengue virus NS4A affect virus fitness and interactions with other non-structural proteins.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
AB  - The dengue virus (DENV) replication complex is made up of its non-structural (NS) proteins and yet-to-be identified host proteins, but the molecular interactions between these proteins are not fully elucidated. In this work, we sought to uncover the interactions between DENV NS1 and its fellow NS proteins using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) approach, and found that domain II of NS1 binds to an N-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of NS4A. Mutations in amino acid residues 41 and 43 in this cytoplasmic region of NS4A disrupted the interaction between NS1 and the NS4A-2K-4B precursor protein. When the NS4A Y41F mutation was introduced into the context of the virus via a DENV2 infectious clone, this mutant virus exhibited impaired viral fitness and decreased infectious virus production. The NS4A Y41F mutant virus triggered a significantly muted transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated genes compared to wild-type virus that is independent of NS4A's ability to antagonize type I interferon signalling. Taken together, we have identified a link between DENV NS1 and the cytoplasmic domain in NS4A that is important for its cellular and viral functions.

Pharmacological concentrations of MPA effectively blocked DV infection, decreasing the percentage of infected cells by 99% and the levels of secreted virus by up to a millionfold. Results were reproduced with four hepatoma cell lines and different flaviviruses, including a recent West Nile virus isolate. Experiments were performed to define the stage in the viral lifecycle at which MPA abrogates infection. Early steps in viral infection, such as viral entry and nucleocapsid uncoating, were not the primary targets of MPA action since its inhibitory effect was retained when naked DV RNA was transfected directly into cells. Biosynthetic labeling experiments showed that MPA did not block the initial phase of viral translation but did interfere with viral protein synthesis in the amplification phase. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that MPA prevented the accumulation of viral positive- and negative-strand RNA as the infection proceeded. We conclude that MPA inhibits flavivirus infection by preventing synthesis and accumulation of viral RNA.

TI  - Myosin Vc, a Member of the Actin Motor Family Associated with Rab8, Is Involved in the Release of DV2 from HepG2 Cells
JF  - Intervirology
VL  - 52
SP  - 258
EP  - 265
AB  - Objective: The pathogenesis of the dengue virus (DV) infection has not been well defined. We have reported that actin and Rab8 are involved in DV2 infection. Myosin Vc (Myo5c) is a novel member of the class V myosins and regulates the actin-mediated membrane trafficking associated with Rab8. In this study, the involvement of Myo5c in the release of DV2 was investigated in HpeG2 cells. Methods: Distributions of actin, Myo5c, DV2 and Rab8 were revealed by fluorescent staining. HepG2Myo5c-tail cells expressing a dominant-negative mutant of Myo5c were constructed by transfection and were assessed by Western blotting. The viral titers were detected by plaque assay, and the expression of Rab8 was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: DV2 infection altered the distribution pattern of Myo5c, which might be associated with the depolymerization of actin, though colocalization rates of Myo5c with DV2 or actin were low. Furthermore, the release of DV2, but not the intracellular viral production, was reduced from HepG2Myo5c-tail cells. Moreover, Myo5c colocalized with Rab8 and an increase of Rab8 was associated with the decrease of the viral release caused by the Myo5c tail.Conclusions: Our data suggest that Myo5c associated with Rab8 is involved in the release of DV2 from HepG2 cells.

VL  - 90 Pt 9

EP  - 106
AB  - This study compared the ability of mosquito and mammalian cell-derived dengue virus (DENV) to infect human dendritic cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN)-expressing cells and characterized the structure of envelope (E) protein N-linked glycans on DENV derived from the two cell types. DENVs derived from both cell types were equally effective at infecting DC-SIGN-expressing human monocytes and dendritic cells. The N-linked glycans on mosquito cell-derived virus were a mix of high-mannose and paucimannose glycans. In virus derived from mammalian cells, the N-linked glycans were a mix of high-mannose and complex glycans. These results indicate that N-linked glycans are incompletely processed during DENV egress from cells, resulting in high-mannose glycans on viruses derived from both cell types. Studies with full-length and truncated E protein demonstrated that incomplete processing was most likely a result of the poor accessibility of glycans on the membrane-anchored protein.

TI  - NF90 Binds the Dengue Virus RNA 3′ Terminus and Is a Positive Regulator of Dengue Virus Replication
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 6
AB  - Background Viral RNA translation and replication are regulated by sequence and structural elements in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR) and by host cell and/or viral proteins that bind them. Dengue virus has a single-stranded RNA genome with positive polarity, a 5′ m7GpppG cap, and a conserved 3′-terminal stem loop (SL) that is linked to proposed functions in viral RNA transcription and translation. Mechanisms explaining the contributions of host proteins to viral RNA translation and replication are poorly defined, yet understanding host protein-viral RNA interactions may identify new targets for therapeutic intervention. This study was directed at identifying functionally significant host proteins that bind the conserved dengue virus RNA 3′ terminus. Methodology/Principal Findings Proteins eluted from a dengue 3′ SL RNA affinity column at increasing ionic strength included two with double-strand RNA binding motifs (NF90/DRBP76 and DEAH box polypeptide 9/RNA helicase A (RHA)), in addition to NF45, which forms a heterodimer with NF90. Although detectable NF90 and RHA proteins localized to the nucleus of uninfected cells, immunofluorescence revealed cytoplasmic NF90 in dengue virus-infected cells, leading us to hypothesize that NF90 has a functional role(s) in dengue infections. Cells depleted of NF90 were used to quantify viral RNA transcript levels and production of infectious dengue virus. NF90 depletion was accompanied by a 50%-70% decrease in dengue RNA levels and in production of infectious viral progeny. Conclusions/Significance The results indicate that NF90 interacts with the 3′ SL structure of the dengue RNA and is a positive regulator of dengue virus replication. NF90 depletion diminished the production of infectious dengue virus by more than 50%, which may have important significance for identifying therapeutic targets to limit a virus that threatens more than a billion people worldwide.

TI  - NK Cells during Dengue Disease and Their Recognition of Dengue Virus-Infected cells
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 5
AB  - The innate immune response, in addition to the B- and T-cell response, plays a role in protection against dengue virus (DENV) infection and the degree of disease severity. Early activation of natural killer (NK) cells and type-I interferon-dependent immunity may be important in limiting viral replication during the early stages of DENV infection and thus reducing subsequent pathogenesis. NK cells may also produce cytokines that reduce inflammation and tissue injury. On the other hand, NK cells are also capable of inducing liver injury at early-time points of DENV infection. In vitro, NK cells can kill antibody-coated DENV-infected cells through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In addition, NK cells may directly recognize DENV-infected cells through their activating receptors, although the increase in HLA class I expression may allow infected cells to escape the NK response. Recently, genome-wide association studies have shown an association between MICB and MICA, which encode ligands of the activating NK receptor NKG2D, and dengue disease outcome. This review focuses on recognition of DENV-infected cells by NK cells and on the regulation of expression of NK cell ligands by DENV.

TI  - NK cells are activated and primed for skin-homing during acute dengue virus infection in humans
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 10
AB  - Despite animal models showing that natural killer (NK) cells are important players in the early defense against many viral infections, the NK cell response is poorly understood in humans. Here we analyze the phenotype, temporal dynamics, regulation and trafficking of NK cells in a patient cohort with acute dengue virus infection. NK cells are robustly activated and proliferate during the first week after symptom debut. Increased IL-18 levels in plasma and in induced skin blisters of DENV-infected patients, as well as concomitant signaling downstream of the IL-18R, suggests an IL-18-dependent mechanism in driving the proliferative NK cell response. Responding NK cells have a less mature phenotype and a distinct chemokine-receptor imprint indicative of skin-homing. A corresponding NK cell subset can be localized to skin early during acute infection. These data provide evidence of an IL-18-driven NK cell proliferation and priming for skin-homing during an acute viral infection in humans. Here, Zimmer et al. analyze the natural killer (NK) cell response in a patient cohort with acute dengue virus infection showing early NK cell activation and proliferation, and the data suggest that NK cell proliferation depends on IL-18 signaling, and that responding NK cells have a skin-homing phenotype.

TI  - NK cells, displaying early activation, cytotoxicity and adhesion molecules, are associated with mild dengue disease
JF  - Clinical & Experimental Immunology
VL  - 143
AB  - During the innate immune response against infections, Natural Killer (NK) cells are as important effector cells as are Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) generated after antigenic stimulation in the adaptative response. NK cells increase in numbers, after viral infection or vaccination. We investigated the NK cell and CD8 T lymphocyte status in 55 dengue infected patients. The NK (CD56+CD3‐) and CD56+ T cell (CD56+CD3+) rates rise during the acute phase of disease. The majority of NK cells from dengue patients display early markers for activation (CD69, HLA‐DR, and CD38) and cell adhesion molecules (CD44, CD11a) during the acute phase of disease. The intracellular cytotoxic granule, TIA‐1, is also up‐regulated early in NK cells. Most of these markers appear also on CD8+ T lymphocytes but during the late acute phase. Circulating IL‐15 is elevated in a significant number of patients during early acute infection and its values were statistically correlated with NK frequencies and cytotoxic markers on NKs. We have therefore shown that dengue virus infection is very likely stimulating a cytotoxic response that may be efficient in controlling the virus in synergism with CD8+ T lymphocytes. Interestingly, the heightened CD56+CD3‐, CD56+CD3+, CD56+TIA‐1+ and CD56+CD11a+ cell rates are associated with mild dengue clinical manifestations and might indicate a good prognosis of the disease.

TI  - NKp44 Receptor Mediates Interaction of the Envelope Glycoproteins from the West Nile and Dengue Viruses with NK Cells1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 183
SP  - 2610
EP  - 2621
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) and West Nile virus (WNV) have become a global concern due to their widespread distribution and their ability to cause a variety of human diseases. Antiviral immune defenses involve NK cells. In the present study, we investigated the interaction between NK cells and these two flaviviruses. We show that the NK-activating receptor NKp44 is involved in virally mediated NK activation through direct interaction with the flavivirus envelope protein. Recombinant NKp44 directly binds to purified DV and WNV envelope proteins and specifically to domain III of WNV envelope protein; it also binds to WNV virus-like particles. These WNV-virus-like particles and WNV-domain III of WNV envelope protein directly bind NK cells expressing high levels of NKp44. Functionally, interaction of NK cells with infective and inactivated WNV results in NKp44-mediated NK degranulation. Finally, WNV infection of cells results in increased binding of rNKp44 that is specifically inhibited by anti-WNV serum. WNV-infected target cells induce IFN-γ secretion and augmented lysis by NKp44-expressing primary NK cells that are blocked by anti-NKp44 Abs. Our findings show that triggering of NK cells by flavivirus is mediated by interaction of NKp44 with the flavivirus envelope protein.

TI  - NLRC5 restricts dengue virus infection by promoting the autophagic degradation of viral NS3 through E3 ligase CUL2 (cullin 2)
JF  - Autophagy
VL  - 19
SP  - 1332
EP  - 1347
AB  - ABSTRACT NLRC5 has been reported to be involved in antiviral immunity; however, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the functional role of NLRC5 in the infection of a flavivirus, dengue virus (DENV). We found that the expression of NLRC5 was strongly induced by virus infection and IFNB or IFNG stimulation in different cell lines. Overexpression of NLRC5 remarkably suppressed DENV infection, whereas knockout of NLRC5 led to a significant increase in DENV infection. Mechanistic study revealed that NLRC5 interacted with the viral nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) protease domain and mediated degradation of NS3 through a ubiquitin-dependent selective macroautophagy/autophagy pathway. We demonstrated that NLRC5 recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL2 (cullin 2) to catalyze K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of the NS3 protease domain, which subsequently served as a recognition signal for cargo receptor TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Together, we have demonstrated that NLRC5 exerted an antiviral effect by mediating the degradation of a multifunctional protein of DENV, providing a novel antiviral signal axis of NLRC5-CUL2-NS3-TOLLIP. This study expands our understanding of the regulatory network of NLRC5 in the host defense against virus infection.

TI  - NMR Analysis of a Novel Enzymatically Active Unlinked Dengue NS2B-NS3 Protease Complex*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 288
SP  - 12891
EP  - 12900
AB  - Background: Dengue protease is a two-component protease that is important for viral replication. Results: An unlinked protease complex containing the NS2B regulatory region and the NS3 protease domain was obtained. Conclusion: The unlinked protease complex produces dispersed cross-peaks in NMR spectra and exists predominantly in a closed conformation in solution. Significance: This new construct will be a useful tool for drug discovery against the dengue virus. The dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen responsible for an estimated 100 million human infections annually. The viral genome encodes a two-component trypsin-like protease that contains the cofactor region from the nonstructural protein NS2B and the protease domain from NS3 (NS3pro). The NS2B-NS3pro complex plays a crucial role in viral maturation and has been identified as a potential drug target. Using a DENV protease construct containing NS2B covalently linked to NS3pro via a Gly4-Ser-Gly4 linker (“linked protease”), previous x-ray crystal structures show that the C-terminal fragment of NS2B is remote from NS3pro and exists in an open state in the absence of an inhibitor; however, in the presence of an inhibitor, NS2B complexes with NS3pro to form a closed state. This linked enzyme produced NMR spectra with severe signal overlap and line broadening. To obtain a protease construct with a resolved NMR spectrum, we expressed and purified an unlinked protease complex containing a 50-residue segment of the NS2B cofactor region and NS3pro without the glycine linker using a coexpression system. This unlinked protease complex was catalytically active at neutral pH in the absence of glycerol and produced dispersed cross-peaks in a 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum that enabled us to conduct backbone assignments using conventional techniques. In addition, titration with an active-site peptide aldehyde inhibitor and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement studies demonstrated that the unlinked DENV protease exists predominantly in a closed conformation in solution. This protease complex can serve as a useful tool for drug discovery against DENV.

TI  - NMR and MD Studies Reveal That the Isolated Dengue NS3 Protease Is an Intrinsically Disordered Chymotrypsin Fold Which Absolutely Requests NS2B for Correct Folding and Functional Dynamics
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue genome encodes a two component protease complex (NS2B-NS3pro) essential for the viral maturation/infectivity, thus representing a key drug target. Previously, due to its “complete insolubility”, the isolated NS3pro could not be experimentally studied and it remains elusive what structure it adopts without NS2B and why NS2B is indispensable. Here as facilitated by our previous discovery, the isolated NS3pro has been surprisingly deciphered by NMR to be the first intrinsically-disordered chymotrypsin-like fold, which exists in a loosely-packed state with non-native long-range interactions as revealed by paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). The disordered NS3pro appears to be needed for binding a human host factor to trigger the membrane remodeling. Moreover, we have in vitro refolded the NS3pro in complex with either NS2B (48–100) or the full-length NS2B (1–130) anchored into the LMPC micelle, and the two complexes have similar activities but different dynamics. We also performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the results revealed that NS2B shows the highest structural fluctuations in the complex, thus providing the dynamic basis for the observation on its conformational exchange between open and closed states. Remarkably, the NS2B cofactor plays a central role in maintaining the correlated motion network required for the catalysis as we previously decoded for the SARS 3CL protease. Indeed, a truncated NS2B (48–100;Δ77–84) with the flexible loop deleted is able to trap the NS2B-NS3pro complex in a highly dynamic and catalytically-impotent state. Taken together, our study implies potential strategies to perturb the NS2B-NS3pro interface for design of inhibitors for treating dengue infection.

TI  - NS1 Protein N-Linked Glycosylation Site Affects the Virulence and Pathogenesis of Dengue Virus
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 11
AB  - Live attenuated vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines against flavivirus. Recently, site-directed mutation of the flavivirus genome using reverse genetics techniques has been used for the rapid development of attenuated vaccines. However, this technique relies on basic research of critical virulence loci of the virus. To screen the attenuated sites in dengue virus, a total of eleven dengue virus type four mutant strains with deletion of N-glycosylation sites in the NS1 protein were designed and constructed. Ten of them (except for the N207-del mutant strain) were successfully rescued. Out of the ten strains, one mutant strain (N130del+207-209QQA) was found to have significantly reduced virulence through neurovirulence assay in suckling mice, but was genetically unstable. Further purification using the plaque purification assay yielded a genetically stable attenuated strain #11-puri9 with mutations of K129T, N130K, N207Q, and T209A in the NS1 protein and E99D in the NS2A protein. Identifying the virulence loci by constructing revertant mutant and chimeric viruses revealed that five amino acid adaptive mutations in the dengue virus type four non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2A dramatically affected its neurovirulence and could be used in constructing attenuated dengue chimeric viruses. Our study is the first to obtain an attenuated dengue virus strain through the deletion of amino acid residues at the N-glycosylation site, providing a theoretical basis for understanding the pathogenesis of the dengue virus and developing its live attenuated vaccines.

TI  - NS3 helicase from dengue virus specifically recognizes viral RNA sequence to ensure optimal replication
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 45

EP  - 12920
AB  - Abstract The protein–RNA interactions within the flavivirus replication complex (RC) are not fully understood. Our structure of dengue virus NS3 adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)/helicase bound to the conserved 5′ genomic RNA 5′-AGUUGUUAGUCU-3′ reveals that D290 and R538 make specific interactions with G2 and G5 bases respectively. We show that single-stranded 12-mer RNA stimulates ATPase activity of NS3, however the presence of G2 and G5 leads to significantly higher activation. D290 is adjacent to the DEXH motif found in SF2 helicases like NS3 and interacts with R387, forming a molecular switch that activates the ATPase site upon RNA binding. Our structure guided mutagenesis revealed that disruption of D290–R387 interaction increases basal ATPase activity presumably as a result of higher conformational flexibility of the ATPase active site. Mutational studies also showed R538 plays a critical role in RNA interactions affecting translocation of viral RNA through dynamic interactions with bases at positions 4 and 5 of the ssRNA. Restriction of backbone flexibility around R538 through mutation of G540 to proline abolishes virus replication, indicating conformational flexibility around residue R538 is necessary for RNA translocation. The functionally critical sequence-specific contacts in NS3 RNA binding groove in subdomain III reveals potentially novel allosteric anti-viral drug targets.

TI  - NS5 from Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Can Adopt a Conformation Analogous to That of Its Zika Virus and Japanese Encephalitis Virus Homologues
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - Flaviviruses include important human pathogens, such as dengue virus and Zika virus. NS5 is a nonstructural protein essential for flavivirus RNA replication with dual MTase and RdRp enzyme activities and thus constitutes a major drug target. Insights into NS5 structure, dynamics, and evolution should inform the development of antiviral inhibitors and vaccine design. We found that NS5 from DENV2 can adopt a conformation resembling that of NS5 from JEV and ZIKV. Replacement of the DENV2 NS5 linker with the JEV and ZIKV NS5 linkers abolished DENV2 replication in cells, without significantly impacting in vitro DENV2 NS5 enzymatic activities. We propose that heterotypic flavivirus NS5 linkers impede DENV2 NS5 protein-protein interactions that are essential for virus replication. ABSTRACT Flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) contains an N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) domain and a C-terminal polymerase (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp]) domain fused through a 9-amino-acid linker. While the individual NS5 domains are structurally conserved, in the full-length protein, their relative orientations fall into two classes: the NS5 proteins from Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) adopt one conformation, while the NS5 protein from dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3) adopts another. Here, we report a crystallographic structure of NS5 from DENV2 in a conformation similar to the extended one seen in JEV and ZIKV NS5 crystal structures. Replacement of the DENV2 NS5 linker with DENV1, DENV3, DENV4, JEV, and ZIKV NS5 linkers had modest or minimal effects on in vitro DENV2 MTase and RdRp activities. Heterotypic DENV NS5 linkers attenuated DENV2 replicon growth in cells, while the JEV and ZIKV NS5 linkers abolished replication. Thus, the JEV and ZIKV linkers likely hindered essential DENV2 NS5 interactions with other viral or host proteins within the virus replicative complex. Overall, this work sheds light on the dynamics of the multifunctional flavivirus NS5 protein and its interdomain linker. Targeting the NS5 linker is a possible strategy for producing attenuated flavivirus strains for vaccine design.

TI  - NS5 of Dengue Virus Mediates STAT2 Binding and Degradation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83
SP  - 5408
EP  - 5418
AB  - ABSTRACT The mammalian interferon (IFN) signaling pathway is a primary component of the innate antiviral response. As such, viral pathogens have devised multiple mechanisms to antagonize this pathway and thus facilitate infection. Dengue virus (DENV) encodes several proteins (NS2a, NS4a, and NS4b) that have been shown individually to inhibit the IFN response. In addition, DENV infection results in reduced levels of expression of STAT2, which is required for IFN signaling (M. Jones, A. Davidson, L. Hibbert, P. Gruenwald, J. Schlaak, S. Ball, G. R. Foster, and M. Jacobs, J. Virol. 79:5414-5420, 2005). Translation of the DENV genome results in a single polypeptide, which is processed by viral and host proteases into at least 10 separate proteins. To date, no single DENV protein has been implicated in the targeting of STAT2 for decreased levels of expression. We demonstrate here that the polymerase of the virus, NS5, binds to STAT2 and is necessary and sufficient for its reduced level of expression. The decrease in protein level observed requires ubiquitination and proteasome activity, strongly suggesting an active degradation process. Furthermore, we show that the degradation of but not binding to STAT2 is dependent on the expression of the polymerase in the context of a polyprotein that undergoes proteolytic processing for NS5 maturation. Thus, the mature form of NS5, when not expressed as a precursor, was able to bind to STAT2 but was unable to target it for degradation, establishing a unique role for viral polyprotein processing in providing an additional function to a viral polypeptide. Therefore, we have identified both a novel mechanism by which DENV evades the innate immune response and a potential target for antiviral therapeutics.

TI  - Natural vertical transmission of dengue virus in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus: a systematic review
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue is of great concern in various parts of the world, especially in tropical and subtropical countries where the mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are present. The transmission of this virus to humans, by what is known as horizontal transmission, occurs through the bite of infected females of one or other of the two mosquito species. Furthermore, an infected female or male parent, by what is known as vertical transmission, can transfer this arbovirus to some part of their offspring. Considering that vertical transmission may represent an important strategy for maintaining the circulation of arboviruses in nature, the verification of this phenomenon worldwide is extremely important and necessary to better understand its dynamic. In the present study, we conducted a literature review of the presence of natural vertical transmission of dengue virus in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus worldwide. Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, sciELO and Lilacs and all the studies published in Portuguese, English and Spanish were read, evaluated and organized by mosquito species, serotype and the location at which the samples were collected. Forty-two studies were included in accordance with the exclusion criteria and methodology. The presence of natural vertical transmission in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus was most clearly evidenced by dengue virus in endemic countries, especially in those in South America and Asia. Despite several African countries being considered endemic for dengue, there is a lack of publications on this subject on that continent, which highlights the importance of conducting studies there. Furthermore, the finding of natural vertical transmission in Ae. albopictus in countries where this species is not yet incriminated as a vector is of great concern as it demonstrates the circulation of this virus in populations of Ae. albopictus and alerts to the possibility of some other mosquito species playing a role in the transmission dynamics of this arbovirus. Parallel to this, the small number of studies of natural vertical transmission of chikungunya and Zika virus in the world may be explained by the recent entry of these arboviruses into most of the countries concerned.

TI  - Near-Atomic Resolution Cryo-Electron Microscopic Structure of Dengue Serotype 4 Virus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 477
EP  - 482
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne virus, is responsible for millions of cases of infections worldwide. There are four DENV serotypes (DENV1 to -4). After a primary DENV infection, the antibodies elicited confer lifetime protection against that DENV serotype. However, in a secondary infection with another serotype, the preexisting antibodies may cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection of macrophage cells, leading to the development of the more severe form of disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever. Thus, a safe vaccine should stimulate protection against all dengue serotypes simultaneously. To facilitate the development of a vaccine, good knowledge of different DENV serotype structures is crucial. Structures of DENV1 and DENV2 had been solved previously. Here we present a near-atomic resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of mature DENV4. Comparison of the DENV4 structure with similar-resolution cryo-EM structures of DENV1 and DENV2 showed differences in surface charge distribution, which may explain their differences in binding to cellular receptors, such as heparin. Also, observed variations in amino acid residues involved in interactions between envelope and membrane proteins on the virus surface correlate with their ability to undergo structural changes at higher temperatures.

TI  - Neofunctionalization driven by positive selection led to the retention of the loqs2 gene encoding an Aedes specific dsRNA binding protein
JF  - BMC Biology
VL  - 22
AB  - Background Mosquito borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever and Chikungunya, cause millions of infections every year. These viruses are mostly transmitted by two urban-adapted mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Although mechanistic understanding remains largely unknown, Aedes mosquitoes may have unique adaptations that lower the impact of viral infection. Recently, we reported the identification of an Aedes specific double-stranded RNA binding protein (dsRBP), named Loqs2, that is involved in the control of infection by dengue and Zika viruses in mosquitoes. Preliminary analyses suggested that the loqs2 gene is a paralog of loquacious (loqs) and r2d2, two co-factors of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, a major antiviral mechanism in insects. Results Here we analyzed the origin and evolution of loqs2. Our data suggest that loqs2 originated from two independent duplications of the first double-stranded RNA binding domain of loqs that occurred before the origin of the Aedes Stegomyia subgenus, around 31 million years ago. We show that the loqs2 gene is evolving under relaxed purifying selection at a faster pace than loqs, with evidence of neofunctionalization driven by positive selection. Accordingly, we observed that Loqs2 is localized mainly in the nucleus, different from R2D2 and both isoforms of Loqs that are cytoplasmic. In contrast to r2d2 and loqs, loqs2 expression is stage- and tissue-specific, restricted mostly to reproductive tissues in adult Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Transgenic mosquitoes engineered to express loqs2 ubiquitously undergo developmental arrest at larval stages that correlates with massive dysregulation of gene expression without major effects on microRNAs or other endogenous small RNAs, classically associated with RNA interference. Conclusions Our results uncover the peculiar origin and neofunctionalization of loqs2 driven by positive selection. This study shows an example of unique adaptations in Aedes mosquitoes that could ultimately help explain their effectiveness as virus vectors.

TI  - Neutrophil Activation and Early Features of NET Formation Are Associated With Dengue Virus Infection in Human
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 9
AB  - The involvement of the immune system in the protection and pathology of natural dengue virus (DENV) has been extensively studied. However, despite studies that have referred to activation of neutrophils in DENV infections, the exact roles of neutrophils remain elusive. Here, we explored the phenotypic and functional responses of neutrophils in a cohort of adult dengue patients. Results indicated that during an acute DENV infection, neutrophils up-regulate CD66b expression, and produce a more robust respiratory response as compared with that in convalescent or healthy individuals; this confirmed in vivo neutrophil activation during DENV infection. Spontaneous decondensation of nuclei, an early event of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, was also markedly increased in cells isolated from DENV-infected patients during the acute phase of the infection. In vitro incubation of NETs with DENV-2 virus significantly decreased DENV infectivity. Interestingly, increased levels of NET components were found in the serum of patients with more severe disease form—dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), but not uncomplicated dengue fever, during the acute phase of the infection. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNFα were also increased in DHF patients as compared with those in healthy and DF subjects. This suggested that NETs may play dual roles during DENV infection. The increased ability for NET formation during acute DENV infection appeared to be independent of PAD4-mediated histone H3 hyper-citrullination. Our study suggests that neutrophils are involved in immunological responses to DENV infection.

TI  - Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Dengue Are Mainly Generated NOX-Independently
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are increasingly recognized to play a role in the pathogenesis of viral infections, including dengue. NETs can be formed NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependently or NOX-independently. NOX-independent NETs can be induced by activated platelets and are very potent in activating the endothelium. Platelet activation with thrombocytopenia and endothelial dysfunction are prominent features of dengue virus infection. We postulated that dengue infection is associated with NOX-independent NET formation, which is related to platelet activation, endothelial perturbation and increased vascular permeability. Using our specific NET assays, we investigated the time course of NET formation in a cohort of Indonesian dengue patients. We found that plasma levels of NETs were profoundly elevated and that these NETs were predominantly NOX-independent NETs. During early recovery phase (7-13 days from fever onset), total NETs correlated negatively with platelet number and positively with platelet P-selectin expression, the binding of von Willebrand factor to platelets and levels of Syndecan-1. Patients with gall bladder wall thickening, an early marker of plasma leakage, had a higher median level of total NETs. Ex vivo, platelets induced NOX-independent NET formation in a dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1)-dependent manner. We conclude that NOX-independent NET formation is enhanced in dengue, which is most likely mediated by NS1 and activated platelets.

TI  - Nitric oxide in dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever: necessity or nuisance?
JF  - Fems Immunology and Medical Microbiology

EP  - 24
AB  - Abstract Advances in free radical research show that reactive oxygen and nitrogen oxide species, for example superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite, play an important role in the pathogenesis of different viral infections, including dengue virus. The pathogenic mechanism of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is complicated and is not clearly understood. The hallmarks of the dengue disease, the antibody‐dependent enhancement, the shift from T‐helper type 1 (Th1) to Th2 cytokine response and the cytokine tsunami resulting in vascular leakage can now be explained much better with the knowledge gained about NO and peroxynitrite. This paper makes an effort to present a synthesis of the current opinions to explain the pathogenesis of DHF/shock syndrome with NO on centre stage.

TI  - Nitric oxide radical suppresses replication of wild‐type dengue 2 viruses in vitro
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 77
AB  - Nitric oxide is well accepted as one of the defenses for inhibiting viral dissemination. Macrophages and cells in the macrophage lineage are professional nitric oxide producers which sub‐serve as target for dengue virus. The interaction between nitric oxide and dengue virus in such target cell is unknown. In this report, the impact of nitric oxide on infectious dengue virus serotype 2 production and RNA replication was investigated in vitro. Primary isolates of dengue virus serotype 2 from dengue patients were replicated in mouse neuroblastoma cells in the presence of an exogenous nitric oxide donor, s‐nitroso‐N‐acethylpennicillamine, SNAP, at the concentration of 50 or 75 or 100 μM. Nitric oxide inhibited viral replication in a dose and a multiplicity of infection dependent manner. Nitric oxide from 50 and 75 μM SNAP delayed and suppressed replication of dengue virus isolates while higher concentration of nitric oxide, 100 μM SNAP, completely inhibited production of infectious particles up to 36 hr study. Twenty‐four out of forty tested isolates, 60%, were susceptible to 50 μM SNAP inhibitory effect. The mechanism of inhibition was investigated at the level of RNA synthesis and was found that RNA production was suppressed which correlated to production of the infectious particles. Down‐regulation of the RNA synthesis resulted in reduction of protein synthesis which was detected by lower level of NS1 protein synthesis using immunoblotting. In conclusion, nitric oxide from exogenous nitric oxide donor down regulated replication of dengue virus serotype 2 isolates from dengue patients. The suppression was clearly shown at the level of viral RNA and protein synthesis resulting in reduction of viral progenies production. This phenomenon implies that nitric oxide may serve as a defense which diminishes viral load in patients. J. Med. Virol. 77:89–95, 2005. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

AB  - Four human monocyte-derived macrophage membrane proteins, with apparent molecular masses of 27, 45, 67 and 87 kDa, were identified as possible receptors for dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN-2) (Mexican isolate 200787/1983), based on affinity chromatography, immunofluorescence, virus overlay protein-binding assays and Western blotting. Additionally, mouse polyclonal antibodies raised against each of the four proteins were capable of partially inhibiting in vitro DEN-2 infection of monocyte-macrophages, thus supporting the notion of a role for such proteins as DEN-2 receptors. Parallel studies were carried out using the human promonocytic U-937 cell line, both as undifferentiated cells and as monocyte-like phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-differentiated cells, as target cells. Whereas interaction between DEN-2 and undifferentiated U-937 cells was almost negligible, PMA-differentiated U-937 cells were shown to harbour putative receptors (with molecular masses of 45 and 67 kDa) for DEN-2, similar to those found in human monocyte-derived macrophages. To our knowledge, this is the first report that describes putative receptors for DEN-2 in primary cultures of human macrophages.

TI  - Non-Canonical Roles of Dengue Virus Non-Structural Proteins
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 9
AB  - The Flaviviridae family comprises a number of human pathogens, which, although sharing structural and functional features, cause diseases with very different outcomes. This can be explained by the plurality of functions exerted by the few proteins coded by viral genomes, with some of these functions shared among members of a same family, but others being unique for each virus species. These non-canonical functions probably have evolved independently and may serve as the base to the development of specific therapies for each of those diseases. Here it is discussed what is currently known about the non-canonical roles of dengue virus (DENV) non-structural proteins (NSPs), which may account for some of the effects specifically observed in DENV infection, but not in other members of the Flaviviridae family. This review explores how DENV NSPs contributes to the physiopathology of dengue, evasion from host immunity, metabolic changes, and redistribution of cellular components during infection.

TI  - Noncoding Flavivirus RNA Displays RNA Interference Suppressor Activity in Insect and Mammalian Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 13486
EP  - 13500
AB  - ABSTRACT West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV) are highly pathogenic, mosquito-borne flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae) that cause severe disease and death in humans. WNV and DENV actively replicate in mosquitoes and human hosts and thus encounter different host immune responses. RNA interference (RNAi) is the predominant antiviral response against invading RNA viruses in insects and plants. As a countermeasure, plant and insect RNA viruses encode RNA silencing suppressor (RSS) proteins to block the generation/activity of small interfering RNA (siRNA). Enhanced flavivirus replication in mosquitoes depleted for RNAi factors suggests an important biological role for RNAi in restricting virus replication, but it has remained unclear whether or not flaviviruses counteract RNAi via expression of an RSS. First, we established that flaviviral RNA replication suppressed siRNA-induced gene silencing in WNV and DENV replicon-expressing cells. Next, we showed that none of the WNV encoded proteins displayed RSS activity in mammalian and insect cells and in plants by using robust RNAi suppressor assays. In contrast, we found that the 3′-untranslated region-derived RNA molecule known as subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) efficiently suppressed siRNA- and miRNA-induced RNAi pathways in both mammalian and insect cells. We also showed that WNV sfRNA inhibits in vitro cleavage of double-stranded RNA by Dicer. The results of the present study suggest a novel role for sfRNA, i.e., as a nucleic acid-based regulator of RNAi pathways, a strategy that may be conserved among flaviviruses.

TI  - Noncoding Subgenomic Flavivirus RNA Is Processed by the Mosquito RNA Interference Machinery and Determines West Nile Virus Transmission by Culex pipiens Mosquitoes
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 10145
EP  - 10159
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses, such as Zika virus, yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus (WNV), are a serious concern for human health. Flaviviruses produce an abundant noncoding subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) in infected cells. sfRNA results from stalling of the host 5′-3′ exoribonuclease XRN1/Pacman on conserved RNA structures in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genomic RNA. sfRNA production is conserved in insect-specific, mosquito-borne, and tick-borne flaviviruses and flaviviruses with no known vector, suggesting a pivotal role for sfRNA in the flavivirus life cycle. Here, we investigated the function of sfRNA during WNV infection of Culex pipiens mosquitoes and evaluated its role in determining vector competence. An sfRNA1-deficient WNV was generated that displayed growth kinetics similar to those of wild-type WNV in both RNA interference (RNAi)-competent and -compromised mosquito cell lines. Small-RNA deep sequencing of WNV-infected mosquitoes indicated an active small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based antiviral response for both the wild-type and sfRNA1-deficient viruses. Additionally, we provide the first evidence that sfRNA is an RNAi substrate in vivo. Two reproducible small-RNA hot spots within the 3′ UTR/sfRNA of the wild-type virus mapped to RNA stem-loops SL-III and 3′ SL, which stick out of the three-dimensional (3D) sfRNA structure model. Importantly, we demonstrate that sfRNA-deficient WNV displays significantly decreased infection and transmission rates in vivo when administered via the blood meal. Finally, we show that transmission and infection rates are not affected by sfRNA after intrathoracic injection, thereby identifying sfRNA as a key driver to overcome the mosquito midgut infection barrier. This is the first report to describe a key biological function of sfRNA for flavivirus infection of the arthropod vector, providing an explanation for the strict conservation of sfRNA production. IMPORTANCE Understanding the flavivirus transmission cycle is important to identify novel targets to interfere with disease and to aid development of virus control strategies. Flaviviruses produce an abundant noncoding viral RNA called sfRNA in both arthropod and mammalian cells. To evaluate the role of sfRNA in flavivirus transmission, we infected mosquitoes with the flavivirus West Nile virus and an sfRNA-deficient mutant West Nile virus. We demonstrate that sfRNA determines the infection and transmission rates of West Nile virus in Culex pipiens mosquitoes. Comparison of infection via the blood meal versus intrathoracic injection, which bypasses the midgut, revealed that sfRNA is important to overcome the mosquito midgut barrier. We also show that sfRNA is processed by the antiviral RNA interference machinery in mosquitoes. This is the first report to describe a pivotal biological function of sfRNA in arthropods. The results explain why sfRNA production is evolutionarily conserved.

TI  - Novel ATP-Independent RNA Annealing Activity of the Dengue Virus NS3 Helicase
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - The flavivirus nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) bears multiple enzymatic activities and represents an attractive target for antiviral intervention. NS3 contains the viral serine protease at the N-terminus and ATPase, RTPase, and helicase activities at the C-terminus. These activities are essential for viral replication; however, the biological role of RNA remodeling by NS3 helicase during the viral life cycle is still unclear. Secondary and tertiary RNA structures present in the viral genome are crucial for viral replication. Here, we used the NS3 protein from dengue virus to investigate functions of NS3 associated to changes in RNA structures. Using different NS3 variants, we characterized a domain spanning residues 171 to 618 that displays ATPase and RNA unwinding activities similar to those observed for the full-length protein. Interestingly, we found that, besides the RNA unwinding activity, dengue virus NS3 greatly accelerates annealing of complementary RNA strands with viral or non-viral sequences. This new activity was found to be ATP-independent. It was determined that a mutated NS3 lacking ATPase activity retained full-RNA annealing activity. Using an ATP regeneration system and different ATP concentrations, we observed that NS3 establishes an ATP-dependent steady state between RNA unwinding and annealing, allowing modulation of the two opposing activities of this enzyme through ATP concentration. In addition, we observed that NS3 enhanced RNA-RNA interactions between molecules representing the ends of the viral genome that are known to be necessary for viral RNA synthesis. We propose that, according to the ATP availability, NS3 could function regulating the folding or unfolding of viral RNA structures.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 6804
EP  - 6818
AB  - ABSTRACT cis-Acting elements in the viral genome RNA (vRNA) are essential for the translation, replication, and/or encapsidation of RNA viruses. In this study, a novel conserved cis-acting element was identified in the capsid-coding region of mosquito-borne flavivirus. The downstream of 5′ cyclization sequence (5′CS) pseudoknot (DCS-PK) element has a three-stem pseudoknot structure, as demonstrated by structure prediction and biochemical analysis. Using dengue virus as a model, we show that DCS-PK enhances vRNA replication and that its function depends on its secondary structure and specific primary sequence. Mutagenesis revealed that the highly conserved stem 1 and loop 2, which are involved in potential loop-helix interactions, are crucial for DCS-PK function. A predicted loop 1-stem 3 base triple interaction is important for the structural stability and function of DCS-PK. Moreover, the function of DCS-PK depends on its position relative to the 5′CS, and the presence of DCS-PK facilitates the formation of 5′-3′ RNA complexes. Taken together, our results reveal that the cis-acting element DCS-PK enhances vRNA replication by regulating genome cyclization, and DCS-PK might interplay with other cis-acting elements to form a functional vRNA cyclization domain, thus playing critical roles during the flavivirus life cycle and evolution.

TI  - Nuclear Localization of Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 5 Does Not Strictly Correlate with Efficient Viral RNA Replication and Inhibition of Type I Interferon Signaling
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 4545
EP  - 4557
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is an important human pathogen, especially in the tropical and subtropical parts of the world, causing considerable morbidity and mortality. DENV replication occurs in the cytoplasm; however, a high proportion of nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), containing methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities, accumulates in the nuclei of infected cells. The present study investigates the impact of nuclear localization of NS5 on its known functions, including viral RNA replication and subversion of the type I interferon response. By using a mutation analysis approach, we identified the most critical residues within the αβ nuclear localization signal (αβNLS), which are essential for the nuclear accumulation of this protein. Although we observed an overall correlation between reduced nuclear accumulation of NS5 and impaired RNA replication, we identified one mutant with drastically reduced amounts of nuclear NS5 and virtually unaffected RNA replication, arguing that nuclear localization of NS5 does not correlate strictly with DENV replication, at least in cell culture. Because NS5 plays an important role in blocking interferon signaling via STAT-2 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 2) degradation, the abilities of the NLS mutants to block this pathway were investigated. All mutants were able to degrade STAT-2, with accordingly similar type I interferon resistance phenotypes. Since the NLS is contained within the RdRp domain, the MTase and RdRp activities of the mutants were determined by using recombinant full-length NS5. We found that the C-terminal region of the αβNLS is a critical functional element of the RdRp domain required for polymerase activity. These results indicate that efficient DENV RNA replication requires only minimal, if any, nuclear NS5, and they identify the αβNLS as a structural element required for proper RdRp activity.

We previously identified two nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) within the central region of dengue virus type‐2 (DENV‐2) NS5 (‘aNLS’ and ‘bNLS’) that are recognized by the importin α/β and importin β1 nuclear transporters, respectively. Here, we demonstrate the importance of the kinetics of NS5 nuclear localization to virus production for the first time and show that the aNLS is responsible. Site‐specific mutations in the bipartite‐type aNLS or bNLS region were introduced into a reporter plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein fused to the N‐terminus of DENV‐2 NS5, as well as into DENV‐2 genomic length complementary DNA. Mutation of basic residues in the highly conserved region of the bNLS did not affect nuclear import of NS5. In contrast, mutations in either basic cluster of the aNLS decreased NS5 nuclear accumulation and reduced virus production, with the greatest reduction observed for mutation of the second cluster (K387K388K389); mutagenesis of both clusters abolished NS5 nuclear import and DENV‐2 virus production completely. The latter appeared to relate to the impaired ability of virus lacking nuclear‐localizing NS5, as compared with wild‐type virus expressing nuclear‐localizing NS5, to reduce interleukin‐8 production as part of the antiviral response. The results overall indicate that NS5 nuclear localization through the aNLS is integral to viral infection, with significant implications for other flaviviruses of medical importance, such as yellow fever and West Nile viruses.

TI  - Nuclear Localization of Flavivirus RNA Synthesis in Infected Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 5451
EP  - 5464
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviral replication is believed to be exclusively cytoplasmic, occurring within virus-induced membrane-bound replication complexes in the host cytoplasm. Here we show that a significant proportion (20%) of the total RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity from cells infected with West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and dengue virus is resident within the nucleus. Consistent with this, the major replicase proteins NS3 and NS5 of JEV also localized within the nucleus. NS5 was found distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, but NS3 was present at sites of active flaviviral RNA synthesis, colocalizing with NS5, and visible as distinct foci along the inner periphery of the nucleus by confocal and immunoelectron microscopy. Both these viral replicase proteins were also present in the nuclear matrix, colocalizing with the peripheral lamina, and revealed a well-entrenched nuclear location for the viral replication complex. In keeping with this observation, antibodies to either NS3 or NS5 coimmunoprecipitated the other protein from isolated nuclei along with newly synthesized viral RNA. Taken together these data suggest an absolute requirement for both of the replicase proteins for nucleus-localized synthesis of flavivirus RNA. Thus, we conclusively demonstrate for the first time that the host cell nucleus functions as an additional site for the presence of functionally active flaviviral replicase complex.

TI  - Nuclear dengue virus NS5 antagonizes expression of PAF1-dependent immune response genes
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 17
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) disruption of the innate immune response is critical to establish infection. DENV non-structural protein 5 (NS5) plays a central role in this disruption, such as antagonism of STAT2. We recently found that DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) NS5 interacts with Polymerase associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C). The primary members of PAF1C are PAF1, LEO1, CTR9 and CDC73. This nuclear complex is an emerging player in the immune response. It promotes the expression of many genes, including genes related to the antiviral, antimicrobial and inflammatory responses, through close association with the chromatin of these genes. Our previous work demonstrated that NS5 antagonizes PAF1C recruitment to immune response genes. However, it remains unknown if NS5 antagonism of PAF1C is complementary to its antagonism of STAT2. Here, we show that knockout of PAF1 enhances DENV2 infectious virion production. By comparing gene expression profiles in PAF1 and STAT2 knockout cells, we find that PAF1 is necessary to express immune response genes that are STAT2-independent. Finally, we mapped the viral determinants for the NS5-PAF1C protein interaction. We found that NS5 nuclear localization and the C-terminal region of the methyltransferase domain are required for its interaction with PAF1C. Mutation of these regions rescued the expression of PAF1-dependent immune response genes that are antagonized by NS5. In sum, our results support a role for PAF1C in restricting DENV2 replication that NS5 antagonizes through its protein interaction with PAF1C. Author summary Dengue virus (DENV) is a pathogen that infects nearly 400 million people a year and thus represents a major challenge for public health. Productive infection by DENV relies on the effective evasion of intrinsic antiviral defenses and is often accomplished through virus-host protein interactions. Here, we investigate the recently discovered interaction between DENV non-structural protein 5 (NS5) and the transcriptional regulator Polymerase associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C). Our work demonstrates PAF1C member PAF1 acts as an antiviral factor and inhibits DENV replication. In parallel, we identified immune response genes involved in intrinsic antiviral defense that depend on PAF1 for expression. We further identified the regions of NS5 required for the protein interaction with PAF1C. Breaking the NS5-PAF1C protein interaction restores the expression of PAF1-dependent immune response genes. Together, our work establishes the antiviral role of PAF1C in DENV infection and NS5 antagonism of PAF1-dependent gene expression through a virus-host protein interaction.

AB  - Anti-dengue 2 virus core protein monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) reacted with antigens in the cytoplasm and in, or on, the nucleus of dengue 2 and dengue 4, but not dengue 1, dengue 3, Kunjin or Murray Valley encephalitis virus-infected cells. These MAbs also reacted with the core protein from dengue 1, 2 and 4 virions in Western blots. The antigens detected by these MAbs could not be detected in uninfected or heat-shocked cells, but were first detected in infected cells approximately 32 h post-infection. PEPSCAN epitope mapping suggested that all the MAbs react with a region of the dengue 2 virus core protein (9RNTPFNMLKRE19) which is adjacent to a putative nuclear localization sequence (6KKAR9) and spans a possible second site for the initiation of synthesis of core protein (12PFN decreases MLKR18).

TI  - Nuclear membrane protein SUN2 promotes replication of flaviviruses through modulating cytoskeleton reorganization mediated by NS1
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 15
AB  - Cytoskeleton is extensively recruited by flaviviruses for their infection. In this study, we uncovered an essential role of a nuclear membrane protein, SAD1/UNC84 domain protein 2 (SUN2) linking cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton in the flavivirus replication. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of SUN2, but not SUN1, significantly reduces the replication of Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). In contrast, SUN2 does not affect the infection of non-flaviviridae RNA viruses. All three regions of SUN2 are required for its proviral effect. Mechanistically, SUN2 facilitates rearrangement of cytoskeleton and formation of replication organelles induced by viral infection, and hence promotes viral RNA synthesis. SUN2 is required for the interaction between cytoskeleton actin and ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). Expression of dominant negative Nesprin-1 and Nesprin-2, which connect SUN2 to cytoskeleton proteins, alleviates the interaction between actin and NS1 and reduces viral replication levels. In a neonatal mouse infection model, SUN2 knockout dramatically alleviates the in vivo ZIKV replication and development of neuropathology. This work elucidates that recruitment of cytoskeleton proteins by flavivirus is coordinated by nuclear membrane proteins SUN2 and Nesprins, providing evidence for a link between nuclear membrane proteins and flavivirus infection. Here, Huang et al. show that nuclear membrane proteins SUN2 and Nesprins are required for the in vitro and in vivo replication of Zika virus, through directing the cytoskeleton remodeling and formation of replication organelles mediated by viral NS1.

TI  - Nucleolin Interacts with the Dengue Virus Capsid Protein and Plays a Role in Formation of Infectious Virus Particles
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 13094
EP  - 13106
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that can cause severe disease in humans and is considered a reemerging pathogen of significant importance to public health. The DENV capsid (C) protein functions as a structural component of the infectious virion; however, it may have additional functions in the virus replicative cycle. Here, we show that the DENV C protein interacts and colocalizes with the multifunctional host protein nucleolin (NCL). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this interaction can be disrupted by the addition of an NCL binding aptamer (AS1411). Knockdown of NCL with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or treatment of cells with AS1411 results in a significant reduction of viral titers after DENV infection. Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed no differences in viral RNA or protein levels at early time points postinfection, suggesting a role for NCL in viral morphogenesis. We support this hypothesis by showing that treatment with AS1411 alters the migration characteristics of the viral capsid, as visualized by native electrophoresis. Here, we identify a critical interaction between DENV C protein and NCL that represents a potential new target for the development of antiviral therapeutics.

TI  - OSBPL10, RXRA and lipid metabolism confer African-ancestry protection against dengue haemorrhagic fever in admixed Cubans
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 13
AB  - Ethnic groups can display differential genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases. The arthropod-born viral dengue disease is one such disease, with empirical and limited genetic evidence showing that African ancestry may be protective against the haemorrhagic phenotype. Global ancestry analysis based on high-throughput genotyping in admixed populations can be used to test this hypothesis, while admixture mapping can map candidate protective genes. A Cuban dengue fever cohort was genotyped using a 2.5 million SNP chip. Global ancestry was ascertained through ADMIXTURE and used in a fine-matched corrected association study, while local ancestry was inferred by the RFMix algorithm. The expression of candidate genes was evaluated by RT-PCR in a Cuban dengue patient cohort and gene set enrichment analysis was performed in a Thai dengue transcriptome. OSBPL10 and RXRA candidate genes were identified, with most significant SNPs placed in inferred weak enhancers, promoters and lncRNAs. OSBPL10 had significantly lower expression in Africans than Europeans, while for RXRA several SNPs may differentially regulate its transcription between Africans and Europeans. Their expression was confirmed to change through dengue disease progression in Cuban patients and to vary with disease severity in a Thai transcriptome dataset. These genes interact in the LXR/RXR activation pathway that integrates lipid metabolism and immune functions, being a key player in dengue virus entrance into cells, its replication therein and in cytokine production. Knockdown of OSBPL10 expression in THP-1 cells by two shRNAs followed by DENV2 infection tests led to a significant reduction in DENV replication, being a direct functional proof that the lower OSBPL10 expression profile in Africans protects this ancestry against dengue disease.

TI  - On the risk of severe dengue during secondary infection: a systematic review coupled with mathematical modeling.
JF  - Journal of vector borne diseases
VL  - 51 3
SP  - 153
EP  - 64
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES
The present study aimed to systematically quantify the well known risk of severe dengue during secondary infection in literature and to understand how epidemiological mechanisms of enhancement during the secondary infection influence the empirically estimated risk of severe dengue by means of mathematical modeling.


METHODS
Two conditional risks of severe dengue, i.e. symptomatic illness and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), given secondary infection were explored based on systematically searched prospective studies. A two-strain epidemiological model was employed to simulate the transmission dynamics of dengue and to identify the relevant data gaps in empirical observations.


RESULTS
Using the variance-based weighting, the pooled relative risk (RR) of symptomatic illness during secondary infection was estimated at 9.4 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.1-14.4], and similarly, RR of DHF/DSS was estimated to be 23.7 (95% CI: 15.3-36.9). A variation in the RR of DHF/DSS was observed among prospective studies. Using the mathematical modeling technique, we identified the duration of cross-protective immunity as an important modulator of the time-dependent behaviour of the RR of severe dengue. Different epidemiological mechanisms of enhancement during secondary infection yielded different RR of severe dengue.


INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION
Optimal design of prospective cohort study for dengue should be considered, accounting for the time-dependence in the RR during the course of dengue epidemic. It is critical to statistically infer the duration of cross-protective immunity and clarify how the enhancement influences the epidemiological dynamics during secondary infection.

TI  - Organization of the Flavivirus RNA replicase complex
JF  - Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA
VL  - 8
AB  - Flaviviruses, such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, are serious human pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality globally each year. Flaviviruses are single‐stranded, positive‐sense RNA viruses, and encode two multidomain proteins, NS3 and NS5, that possess all enzymatic activities required for genome replication and capping. NS3 and NS5 interact within virus‐induced replication compartments to form the RNA genome replicase complex. Although the individual enzymatic activities of both proteins have been extensively studied and are well characterized, there are still gaps in our understanding of how they interact to efficiently coordinate their respective activities during positive‐strand RNA synthesis and capping. Here, we discuss what is known about the structures and functions of the NS3 and NS5 proteins and propose a preliminary NS3:NS5:RNA interaction model based on a large body of literature about how the viral enzymes function, physical restraints between NS3 and NS5, as well as critical steps in the replication process.

EP  - 291
AB  - BACKGROUND Dengue is considered one of the world’s most important mosquito-borne diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding single-stranded RNAs that play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Although miRNAs possess antiviral activity against many mammalian-infecting viruses, their involvement in Dengue virus (DENV) replication remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE To determine the role of miR-484 and miR-744 in DENV infection and to examine whether DENV infection alters the expression of both miRNAs. METHODS We used bioinformatics tools to explore the relationship between DENV and cellular miRNAs. We then overexpressed miR-484 or miR-744 in Vero cells to examine their role in DENV replication using flow cytometry, reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western blotting. FINDINGS We found several cellular miRNAs that target a conserved region within the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of the genome of the four DENV serotypes and found that overexpression of miR-484 or miR-744 inhibits infection by DENV-1 to DENV-4. Furthermore, we observed that DENV RNA might be involved in the downregulation of endogenous miR-484 and miR-744. CONCLUSION Our study identifies miR-484 and miR-744 as two possible restriction host factors against DENV infection. However, further studies are needed to directly verify whether miR-484 and miR-744 both have an anti-DENV effect in vivo.

AB  - ABSTRACT The dengue virus genome is a dynamic molecule that adopts different conformations in the infected cell. Here, using RNA folding predictions, chemical probing analysis, RNA binding assays, and functional studies, we identified new cis-acting elements present in the capsid coding sequence that facilitate cyclization of the viral RNA by hybridization with a sequence involved in a local dumbbell structure at the viral 3′ untranslated region (UTR). The identified interaction differentially enhances viral replication in mosquito and mammalian cells.

TI  - Overlapping and Distinct Molecular Determinants Dictating the Antiviral Activities of TRIM56 against Flaviviruses and Coronavirus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 13821
EP  - 13835
AB  - ABSTRACT The tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) proteins have emerged as a new class of host antiviral restriction factors, with several demonstrating roles in regulating innate antiviral responses. Of >70 known TRIMs, TRIM56 inhibits replication of bovine viral diarrhea virus, a ruminant pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae, but has no appreciable effect on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a rhabdovirus. Yet the antiviral spectrum of TRIM56 remains undefined. In particular, how TRIM56 impacts human-pathogenic viruses is unknown. Also unclear are the molecular determinants governing the antiviral activities of TRIM56. Herein, we show that TRIM56 poses a barrier to infections by yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), and human coronavirus virus (HCoV) OC43 but not encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Moreover, by engineering cell lines conditionally expressing various TRIM56 mutants, we demonstrated that TRIM56's antiflavivirus effects required both the E3 ligase activity that lies in the N-terminal RING domain and the integrity of its C-terminal portion, while the restriction of HCoV-OC43 relied upon the TRIM56 E3 ligase activity alone. Furthermore, TRIM56 was revealed to impair YFV and DENV2 propagation by suppressing intracellular viral RNA accumulation but to compromise HCoV-OC43 infection at a later step in the viral life cycle, suggesting that distinct TRIM56 domains accommodate differing antiviral mechanisms. Altogether, TRIM56 is a versatile antiviral host factor that confers resistance to YFV, DENV2, and HCoV-OC43 through overlapping and distinct molecular determinants. IMPORTANCE We previously reported tripartite motif protein 56 (TRIM56) as a host restriction factor of bovine viral diarrhea virus, a ruminant pathogen. However, the impact of TRIM56 on human-pathogenic RNA viruses is unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that TRIM56 restricts two medically important flaviviruses, yellow fever virus (YFV) and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), and a human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, but not encephalomyocarditis virus, a picornavirus. Further, we show that TRIM56-mediated inhibition of HCoV-OC43 multiplication depends solely on its E3 ligase activity, whereas its restriction of YFV and DENV2 requires both the E3 ligase activity and integrity of the C-terminal portion. The differing molecular determinants appear to accommodate distinct antiviral mechanisms TRIM56 adopts to target different families of viruses; while TRIM56 curbs intracellular YFV/DENV2 RNA replication, it acts at a later step in HCoV-OC43 life cycle. These novel findings illuminate the molecular basis of the versatility and specificity of TRIM56's antiviral activities against positive-strand RNA viruses.

TI  - PERK Signal-Modulated Protein Translation Promotes the Survivability of Dengue 2 Virus-Infected Mosquito Cells and Extends Viral Replication
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 9
AB  - Survival of mosquitoes from dengue virus (DENV) infection is a prerequisite of viral transmission to the host. This study aimed to see how mosquito cells can survive the infection during prosperous replication of the virus. In C6/36 cells, global protein translation was shut down after infection by DENV type 2 (DENV2). However, it returned to a normal level when infected cells were treated with an inhibitor of the protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) signaling pathway. Based on a 7-Methylguanosine 5′-triphosphate (m7GTP) pull-down assay, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex was also identified in DENV2-infected cells. This suggests that most mosquito proteins are synthesized via canonical cap-dependent translation. When the PERK signal pathway was inhibited, both accumulation of reactive oxygen species and changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential increased. This suggested that ER stress response was alleviated through the PERK-mediated shutdown of global proteins in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells. In the meantime, the activities of caspases-9 and -3 and the apoptosis-related cell death rate increased in C6/36 cells with PERK inhibition. This reflected that the PERK-signaling pathway is involved in determining cell survival, presumably by reducing DENV2-induced ER stress. Looking at the PERK downstream target, α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), an increased phosphorylation status was only shown in infected C6/36 cells. This indicated that recruitment of ribosome binding to the mRNA 5′-cap structure could have been impaired in cap-dependent translation. It turned out that shutdown of cellular protein translation resulted in a pro-survival effect on mosquito cells in response to DENV2 infection. As synthesis of viral proteins was not affected by the PERK signal pathway, an alternate mode other than cap-dependent translation may be utilized. This finding provides insights into elucidating how the PERK signal pathway modulates dynamic translation of proteins and helps mosquito cells survive continuous replication of the DENV2. It was ecologically important for virus amplification in mosquitoes and transmission to humans.

TI  - PKR-mediated stress response enhances dengue and Zika virus replication
JF  - mBio
VL  - 14
AB  - ABSTRACT The mechanisms by which flaviviruses use non-canonical translation to support their replication in host cells are largely unknown. Here, we investigated how the integrated stress response (ISR), which promotes translational arrest by eIF2ɑ phosphorylation (p-eIF2ɑ), regulates flavivirus replication. During dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, eIF2ɑ phosphorylation peaked at 24 hours post-infection and was dependent on protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) but not type I interferon. The ISR is activated downstream of p-eIF2α during infection with either virus, but translation arrest only occurred following DENV4 infection. Despite this difference, both DENV4 and ZIKV replications were impaired in cells lacking PKR, independent of type I interferon/NF-kB signaling or cell viability. By using a ZIKV 5′-untranslated region (UTR) reporter system as a model, we found that this region of the genome is sufficient to promote an enhancement of viral mRNA translation in the presence of an active ISR. Together, we provide evidence that flaviviruses escape ISR translational arrest and co-opt this response to increase viral replication. IMPORTANCE One of the fundamental features that make viruses intracellular parasites is the necessity to use cellular translational machinery. Hence, this is a crucial checkpoint for controlling infections. Here, we show that dengue and Zika viruses, responsible for nearly 400 million infections every year worldwide, explore such control for optimal replication. Using immunocompetent cells, we demonstrate that arrest of protein translations happens after sensing of dsRNA and that the information required to avoid this blocking is contained in viral 5′-UTR. Our work, therefore, suggests that the non-canonical translation described for these viruses is engaged when the intracellular stress response is activated.

JF  - Journal of Virology

SP  - 525
EP  - 531
AB  - ABSTRACT Charge-to-alanine mutagenesis of dengue virus type 4 (DEN4) NS5 gene generated a collection of attenuating mutations for potential use in a recombinant live attenuated DEN vaccine. Codons for 80 contiguous pairs of charged amino acids in NS5 were individually mutagenized to create uncharged pairs of alanine residues, and 32 recombinant mutant viruses were recovered from the 80 full-length mutant DEN4 cDNA constructs. These mutant viruses were tested for temperature-sensitive (ts) replication in both Vero cells and HuH-7 human hepatoma cells. Of the 32 mutants, 13 were temperature sensitive (ts) in both cell lines, 11 were not ts in either cell line, and 8 exhibited a host range (tshr) phenotype. One tshr mutant was ts only in Vero cells, and seven were ts only in HuH-7 cells. Nineteen of the 32 mutants were 10-fold or more restricted in replication in the brains of suckling mice compared to that of wild-type DEN4, and three mutants were approximately 10,000-fold restricted in replication. The level of temperature sensitivity of replication in vitro did not correlate with attenuation in vivo. A virus bearing two pairs of charge-to-alanine mutations was constructed and demonstrated increased temperature sensitivity and attenuation relative to either parent virus. This large set of charge-to-alanine mutations specifying a wide range of attenuation for mouse brain should prove useful in fine-tuning recombinant live attenuated DEN vaccines.

VL  - 13 6
SP  - 1621
EP  - 1630
AB  - The 11 kDa, positively charged dengue capsid protein (C protein) exists stably as a homodimer and colocalizes with the viral genome within mature viral particles. Its core is composed of four alpha helices encompassing a small hydrophobic patch that may interact with lipids, but approximately 20% of the protein at the N-terminus is intrinsically disordered, making it challenging to elucidate its conformational landscape. Here, we combine small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS), and atomic-resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to probe the dynamics of dengue C proteins. We show that the use of MD force fields (FFs) optimized for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is necessary to capture their conformational landscape and validate the computationally generated ensembles with reference to SAXS and HDXMS data. Representative ensembles of the C protein dimer are characterized by alternating, clamp-like exposure and occlusion of the internal hydrophobic patch, as well as by residual helical structure at the disordered N-terminus previously identified as a potential source of autoinhibition. Such dynamics are likely to determine the multifunctionality of the C protein during the flavivirus life cycle and hence impact the design of novel antiviral compounds.

TI  - Participation of 14-3-3ε and 14-3-3ζ proteins in the phagocytosis, component of cellular immune response, in Aedes mosquito cell lines
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 10
AB  - Better knowledge of the innate immune system of insects will improve our understanding of mosquitoes as potential vectors of diverse pathogens. The ubiquitously expressed 14-3-3 protein family is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals, and at least two isoforms of 14-3-3, the ε and ζ, have been identified in insects. These proteins have been shown to participate in both humoral and cellular immune responses in Drosophila. As mosquitoes of the genus Aedes are the primary vectors for arboviruses, causing several diseases such as dengue fever, yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya fevers, cell lines derived from these mosquitoes, Aag-2 from Aedes aegypti and C6/36 HT from Aedes albopictus, are currently used to study the insect immune system. Here, we investigated the role of 14-3-3 proteins (ε and ζ isoform) in phagocytosis, the main cellular immune responses executed by the insects, using Aedes spp. cell lines. We evaluated the mRNA and protein expression of 14-3-3ε and 14-3-3ζ in C6/36 HT and Aag-2 cells, and demonstrated that both proteins were localised in the cytoplasm. Further, in C6/36 HT cells treated with a 14-3-3 specific inhibitor we observed a notable modification of cell morphology with filopodia-like structure caused through cytoskeleton reorganisation (co-localization of 14-3-3 proteins with F-actin), more importantly the decrease in Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli phagocytosis and reduction in phagolysosome formation. Additionally, silencing of 14-3-3ε and 14-3-3ζ expression by mean of specific DsiRNA confirmed the decreased phagocytosis and phagolysosome formation of pHrodo labelled E. coli and S. aureus bacteria by Aag-2 cells. The 14-3-3ε and 14-3-3ζ proteins modulate cytoskeletal remodelling, and are essential for phagocytosis of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in Aedes spp. cell lines.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
To analyze the current knowledge of pathogen-insect interactions amenable for the design of molecular-based control strategies of vector-borne diseases.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We examined malaria, dengue, and Chagas disease pathogens and insect molecules that participate in interactions during their vectors infection.


RESULTS
Pathogen molecules that participate in the insect intestine invasion and induced vector immune molecules are presented, and their inclusion in transmission blocking vaccines (TBV) and in genetically modify insect (GMI) vectors or symbiotic bacteria are discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
Disruption of processes by blocking vector-pathogen interactions provides several candidates for molecular control strategies, but TBV and GMI efficacies are still limited and other secondary effects of GMI (improving transmission of other pathogens, affectation of other organisms) should be discarded.

TI  - Pathogenesis and Inhibition of Flaviviruses from a Carbohydrate Perspective
JF  - Pharmaceuticals
VL  - 10
AB  - Flaviviruses are enveloped, positive single stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses with various routes of transmission. While the type and severity of symptoms caused by pathogenic flaviviruses vary from hemorrhagic fever to fetal abnormalities, their general mechanism of host cell entry is similar. All pathogenic flaviviruses, such as dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Zika virus, bind to glycosaminglycans (GAGs) through the putative GAG binding sites within their envelope proteins to gain access to the surface of host cells. GAGs are long, linear, anionic polysaccharides with a repeating disaccharide unit and are involved in many biological processes, such as cellular signaling, cell adhesion, and pathogenesis. Flavivirus envelope proteins are N-glycosylated surface proteins, which interact with C-type lectins, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) through their glycans. In this review, we discuss both host and viral surface receptors that have the carbohydrate components, focusing on the surface interactions in the early stage of flavivirus entry. GAG-flavivirus envelope protein interactions as well as interactions between flavivirus envelope proteins and DC-SIGN are discussed in detail. This review also examines natural and synthetic inhibitors of flaviviruses that are carbohydrate-based or carbohydrate-targeting. Both advantages and drawbacks of these inhibitors are explored, as are potential strategies to improve their efficacy to ultimately help eradicate flavivirus infections.

TI  - Pathogenesis of Dengue: Dawn of a New Era
JF  - F1000Research
VL  - 4
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infections of humans were long thought to be self-limited and of low mortality. Beginning in the 1950s, at the time when four different DENVs were discovered, a lethal variant of dengue emerged. Dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) initially observed in Southeast Asia now has spread throughout the world. Two risk factors for DHF/DSS are well-established: severe disease occurs during a second heterotypic DENV infection or during a first DENV infection in infants born to dengue-immune mothers. A large number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain severe dengue disease. As discussed, few of them attempt to explain why severe disease occurs under the two different immunological settings. New experimental evidence has demonstrated that DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is toll-receptor 4 agonist that stimulates primary human myeloid cells to produce the same cytokines observed during the course of severe dengue disease. In addition, NS1 directly damages endothelial cells. These observations have been repeated and extended to an in vivo mouse model. The well-established phenomenon, antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection in Fc-receptor-bearing cells, should similarly enhance the production of DENV NS1 in humans, providing a unitary mechanism for severe disease in both immunological settings

AB  - Dengue viruses occur as four antigenically related but distinct serotypes transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. These viruses generally cause a benign syndrome, dengue fever, in the American and African tropics, and a severe syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), in Southeast Asian children. This severe syndrome, which recently has also been identified in children infected with the virus in Puerto Rico, is characterized by increased vascular permeability and abnormal hemostasis. It occurs in infants less than 1 year of age born to dengue-immune mothers and in children 1 year and older who are immune to one serotype of dengue virus and are experiencing infection with a second serotype. Dengue viruses replicate in cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage, and subneutralizing concentrations of dengue antibody enhance dengue virus infection in these cells. This antibody-dependent enhancement of infection regulates dengue disease in human beings, although disease severity may also be controlled genetically, possibly by permitting and restricting the growth of virus in monocytes. Monoclonal antibodies show heterogeneous distribution of antigenic epitopes on dengue viruses. These epitopes serve to regulate disease: when antibodies to shared antigens partially neutralize heterotypic virus, infection and disease are dampened; enhancing antibodies alone result in heightened disease response. Further knowledge of the structure of dengue genomes should permit rapid advances in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of dengue.

TI  - Pathogenesis of vascular leak in dengue virus infection
JF  - Immunology
VL  - 151
AB  - Endothelial dysfunction leading to vascular leak is the hallmark of severe dengue. Vascular leak typically becomes clinically evident 3–6 days after the onset of illness, which is known as the critical phase. This critical phase follows the period of peak viraemia, and lasts for 24–48 hr and usually shows rapid and complete reversal, suggesting that it is likely to occur as a result of inflammatory mediators, rather than infection of the endothelium. Cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor‐α, which are known to be elevated in the critical phase of dengue, are likely to be contributing factors. Dengue NS1, a soluble viral protein, has also been shown to disrupt the endothelial glycocalyx and thus contribute to vascular leak, although there appears to be a discordance between the timing of NS1 antigenaemia and occurrence of vascular leak. In addition, many inflammatory lipid mediators are elevated in acute dengue viral infection such as platelet activating factor (PAF) and leukotrienes. Furthermore, many other inflammatory mediators such as vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin‐2 have been shown to be elevated in patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever, exerting their action in part by inducing the activity of phospholipases, which have diverse inflammatory effects including generation of PAF. Platelets have also been shown to significantly contribute to endothelial dysfunction by production of interleukin‐1β through activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and also by inducing production of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes. Drugs that block down‐stream immunological mediator pathways such as PAF may also be beneficial in the treatment of severe disease.

TI  - Pathogenic Parameters Derived from Activated Platelets in Dengue Patients

EP  - 7
AB  - Platelets have been recognized to be an integral part of human immune system. Hematologic disfunction, such as thrombocytopenia, is one of the most salient clinical features in dengue patients. Understanding the parameters released from activated platelets, involving in maintaining the delicate network, can provide a better picture of pathogenic cause of dengue. Ninety four dengue confirmed patients, 24 other febrile patients, and 12 healthy controls were enrolled to study. The parameters including the levels of polyphosphates, bradykinin, thyroxine, nitrite/ nitrate, platelet factor 4 (PF4), and serotonin, from the circulation of dengue patients were quantified by commercial ELISA kits and then compared to that from patients with other febrile illnesses, follow-up samples, and healthy controls. The following results were documented. Results 1. The levels of polyphosphates were on average 30% higher in acute dengue samples than healthy controls. 2. The levels of thyroxine, and nitrite/nitrate were significantly higher in acute dengue samples compared to that of other febrile, follow-up and healthy samples, while bradykinin was significantly lower. 3. The levels of PF4 were not different among samples of acute dengue, other febrile illness and follow-up, but were all significantly higher than the healthy controls. 4. The levels of serotonin were significantly higher in acute febrile stage compared to convalescent stage; while significantly lower than healthy subjects. The dynamic network of biochemical programs that coordinate to maintain hemostasis become unbalanced during and following dengue virus infection. Factors released from activated platelets may influence the vascular permeability

TI  - Pathogenic Roles of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor during Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Mediators of Inflammation
VL  - 2015
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common cause of viral hemorrhagic fever, which can lead to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Hemorrhage and plasma leakage are two major hallmarks of DHF/DSS. Because the mechanisms causing these pathogenic changes are unclear, there is no effective therapy against DHF/DSS. In this review, we focus on the possible pathogenic effects of a pleiotropic cytokine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), on the pathogenesis of DENV infection. MIF is a critical mediator of the host immune response and inflammation, and there is a correlation between the serum levels of MIF and disease severity in dengue patients. Furthermore, MIF knock-out mice exhibit less severe clinical disease and lethality. However, the role of MIF in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not limited to immune cell recruitment. Recent evidence indicates that DENV infection induced MIF production and may contribute to vascular hyperpermeability and viral replication during DENV infection. The expression of both adhesion and coagulation molecules on MIF-stimulated monocytes and endothelial cells is also increased, which may contribute to inflammatory and anticoagulatory states during DHF/DSS. Therefore, blocking MIF production or its function may provide a solution for the treatment and prevention of DHF/DSS.

TI  - Pathogens Enter Mosquito’s Salivary Glands through the Existing Lesions in their Organs: A Potential Transmission Mechanism for Infectious Diseases
JF  - Asian Journal of Research in Infectious Diseases
AB  - Whether pathogens in the ingested blood meal can enter the salivary glands of mosquitoes is a decisive factor in disease transmission. Unlike the known mosquito-borne pathogens (e.g. ZIKA, dengue, etc.), most human pathogens cannot enter the salivary glands of mosquitoes, and their survival time inside mosquito is usually short. Studies have reported that some mosquito species infected with certain mosquito-borne pathogens developed lesions in organs (e.g. holes in the midgut). Therefore, some of the pathogens which cannot enter the salivary glands of mosquitoes on their own (PWCESGMTO) may quickly enter using the existing lesions in the organs. This highly plausible issue has been neglected in research, and may involve the transmission of many infectious diseases. Since PWCESGMTOes can usually survive inside mosquitoes for only short period, successful transmission occurs only if mosquitoes bite a non-infected person before the ingested pathogens die. Therefore, the infected people should usually be in close proximity. The present paper discusses the neglected issue and the puzzling correlation between mosquitoes and three example diseases, and calls for urgent research into the issue.

TI  - Pathways Exploited by Flaviviruses to Counteract the Blood-Brain Barrier and Invade the Central Nervous System
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Human infection by different flaviviruses may cause severe neurologic syndromes, through pathogenic mechanisms that are still largely unknown. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are believed to reach the central nervous system by a hematogenous route, upon crossing the blood-brain barrier. Although the disruption of BBB during flavivirus infection has been largely evidenced in experimental models, the relevance of BBB breakdown for virus entering the brain was not completely elucidated. In vitro models of BBB had demonstrated that these viruses replicated in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), which induced downregulation of tight junction proteins and increased the permeability of the barrier. Other reports demonstrated that infection of BMECs allowed the basolateral release of infectious particles, without a remarkable cytopathic effect, what might be sufficient for virus invasion. Virus replication and activation of other cells associated to the BBB, mostly astrocytes and microglia, were also reported to affect the endothelial barrier permeability. This event might occur simultaneously or after BMECs infection, being a secondary effect leading to BBB disruption. Importantly, activation of BMECs, astrocytes, and microglia by flaviviruses was associated to the expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators, which are believed to recruit leukocytes to the CNS. The leukocyte infiltrate could further mediate viral invasion through a Trojan horse mechanism and might contribute to BBB breakdown and to neurological alterations. This review discussed the previous studies regarding in vitro and in vivo models of JEV, WNV, ZIKV, YFV, DENV, and TBEV infection and addressed the pathways for BBB overcome and invasion of the CNS described for each virus infection, aiming to increment the knowledge and stimulate further discussion about the role of BBB in the neuropathogenesis of flavivirus infection.

TI  - Peptide Bβ15-42 Preserves Endothelial Barrier Function in Shock
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 4
AB  - Loss of vascular barrier function causes leak of fluid and proteins into tissues, extensive leak leads to shock and death. Barriers are largely formed by endothelial cell-cell contacts built up by VE-cadherin and are under the control of RhoGTPases. Here we show that a natural plasmin digest product of fibrin, peptide Bß15-42 (also called FX06), significantly reduces vascular leak and mortality in animal models for Dengue shock syndrome. The ability of Bß15-42 to preserve endothelial barriers is confirmed in rats i.v.-injected with LPS. In endothelial cells, Bß15-42 prevents thrombin-induced stress fiber formation, myosin light chain phosphorylation and RhoA activation. The molecular key for the protective effect of Bß15-42 is the src kinase Fyn, which associates with VE-cadherin-containing junctions. Following exposure to Bß15-42 Fyn dissociates from VE-cadherin and associates with p190RhoGAP, a known antagonists of RhoA activation. The role of Fyn in transducing effects of Bß15-42 is confirmed in Fyn−/− mice, where the peptide is unable to reduce LPS-induced lung edema, whereas in wild type littermates the peptide significantly reduces leak. Our results demonstrate a novel function for Bß15-42. Formerly mainly considered as a degradation product occurring after fibrin inactivation, it has now to be considered as a signaling molecule. It stabilizes endothelial barriers and thus could be an attractive adjuvant in the treatment of shock.

TI  - Peptides as Therapeutic Agents for Dengue Virus

EP  - 1359
AB  - Dengue is an important global threat caused by dengue virus (DENV) that records an estimated 390 million infections annually. Despite the availability of CYD-TDV as a commercial vaccine, its long-term efficacy against all four dengue virus serotypes remains unsatisfactory. There is therefore an urgent need for the development of antiviral drugs for the treatment of dengue. Peptide was once a neglected choice of medical treatment but it has lately regained interest from the pharmaceutical industry following pioneering advancements in technology. In this review, the design of peptide drugs, antiviral activities and mechanisms of peptides and peptidomimetics (modified peptides) action against dengue virus are discussed. The development of peptides as inhibitors for viral entry, replication and translation is also described, with a focus on the three main targets, namely, the host cell receptors, viral structural proteins and viral non-structural proteins. The antiviral peptides designed based on these approaches may lead to the discovery of novel anti-DENV therapeutics that can treat dengue patients.

TI  - Peripheral Follicular T Helper Cells and Mucosal-Associated Invariant T Cells Represent Activated Phenotypes During the Febrile Phase of Acute Dengue Virus Infection.
JF  - Viral immunology
AB  - Peripheral follicular helper T (pTfh) cells represent specialized CD4+ T cells that help B cells to secrete antibodies. Dengue infection appears to cause immune activation in a wide array of immune cells. Herein, we investigated the signatures of immune activation of circulating Tfh cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in adult subjects with confirmed acute clinical dengue virus (DENV) infection by multiparametric flow cytometry. The acute DENV infection induced a significant expansion and activation of pTfh cells and circulating MAIT cells during acute febrile infection. We found a higher frequency of activated PD-1+ Tfh cells and CD38+ pTfh cells in clinical DENV infection. We also found similar activated and expanding phenotypes of MAIT cells in the patients tested. The numbers of activated pTfh cells and circulating MAIT cells were higher in dengue patients relative to healthy controls. We concluded that pTfh cells and circulating MAIT cells represent activated phenotypes in acute DENV infection.

TI  - Peripheral Organs of Dengue Fatal Cases Present Strong Pro-Inflammatory Response with Participation of IFN-Gamma-, TNF-Alpha- and RANTES-Producing Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue disease is an acute viral illness caused by dengue virus (DENV) that can progress to hemorrhagic stages leading to about 20000 deaths every year worldwide. Despite many clinical investigations regarding dengue, the immunopathogenic process by which infected patients evolve to the severe forms is not fully understood. Apart from differences in virulence and the antibody cross reactivity that can potentially augment virus replication, imbalanced cellular immunity is also seen as a major concern in the establishment of severe dengue. In this context, the investigation of cellular immunity and its products in dengue fatal cases may provide valuable data to help revealing dengue immunopathogenesis. Here, based in four dengue fatal cases infected by the serotype 3 in Brazil, different peripheral organs (livers, lungs and kidneys) were studied to evaluate the presence of cell infiltrates and the patterns of local cytokine response. The overall scenario of the studied cases revealed a considerable systemic involvement of infection with mononuclear cells targeted to all of the evaluated organs, as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Quantification of cytokine-expressing cells in peripheral tissues was also performed to characterize the ongoing inflammatory process by the severe stage of the disease. Increased levels of IFN-γ- and TNF-α-expressing cells in liver, lung and kidney samples of post-mortem subjects evidenced a strong pro-inflammatory induction in these tissues. The presence of increased RANTES-producing cell numbers in all analyzed organs suggested a possible link between the clinical status and altered vascular permeability. Co-staining of DENV RNA and IFN-γ or TNF-α using in situ hibridization and IHC confirmed the virus-specific trigger of the pro-inflammatory response. Taken together, this work provided additional evidences that corroborated with the traditional theories regarding the “cytokine storm” and the occurrence of uneven cellular immunity in response to DENV as major reasons for progress to severe disease.

EP  - 52
AB  - Plasma leakage is one of the characteristic features of dengue haemorrhagic fever. The interaction among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), dengue virus and endothelial cells was analysed in vitro. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were infected with dengue-2 virus (DV-2) at an m.o.i. of 0.5 p.f.u. per cell. PBMCs were added to DV-2-infected HUVECs, and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and transalbumin permeability were assessed. Dengue virus infection at an m.o.i. of 0.5 p.f.u. per cell alone did not decrease the TEER, but addition of PBMCs decreased the TEER, increased the albumin permeability and induced morphological changes of HUVECs. The extent of the decrease was more profound with adherent PBMCs than with non-adherent PBMCs. The expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) was examined using real-time RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Addition of PBMCs to DV-2-infected HUVECs decreased the levels of mRNA transcripts and cell-surface expression of VE-cadherin. The results indicate that PBMCs increased the permeability of DV-2-infected HUVECs and that the increased permeability was concomitant with morphological change and the decrease in VE-cadherin expression. The results suggest that functional impairment of the DV-2-infected HUVEC monolayer was caused by interaction with PBMCs.

TI  - Peripheral serotonin causes dengue virus-induced thrombocytopenia through 5HT2 receptors.
JF  - Blood
VL  - 133 21
SP  - 2325
EP  - 2337
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent vector-borne viral pathogen, infecting millions of patients annually. Thrombocytopenia, a reduction in circulating platelet counts, is the most consistent sign of DENV-induced disease, independent of disease severity. However, the mechanisms leading to DENV-induced thrombocytopenia are unknown. Here, we show that thrombocytopenia is caused by serotonin derived from mast cells (MCs), which are immune cells that are present in the perivascular space and are a major peripheral source of serotonin. We show that during DENV infection, MCs release serotonin, which prompts platelet activation, aggregation, and enhanced phagocytosis, dependent on 5HT2A receptors. MC deficiency in mice or pharmacologic inhibition of MCs reversed thrombocytopenia. Furthermore, reconstitution of MC-deficient mice with wild-type MCs, but not MCs lacking serotonin synthesis resulting from deficiency in the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase-1, restored the thrombocytopenic phenotype. Exogenous serotonin was also sufficient to overcome the effects of drugs that inhibit platelet activation in vitro and to restore thrombocytopenia in DENV-infected MC-deficient mice. Therapeutic targeting of 5HT2A receptors during DENV infection effectively prevented thrombocytopenia in mice. Similarly, serotonin derived from DENV-activated human MCs led to increased human platelet activation. Thus, MC-derived serotonin is a previously unidentified mechanism of DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and a potential therapeutic target.

EP  - 265
AB  - The peritrophic membrane (PM) is a non-cellular tissue involved in the protection of midgut epithelium from mechanical damage and insults from pathogens. This study was carried out to determine the involvement of PM in mosquitoes after infection with dengue virus. Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes were fed sucrose and human blood with and without dengue virus type 2 (D2-16681), and collected at 0.5, 1, 6, and 12 h, respectively. Specimens were prepared for examination under light and electron microscopy. The results showed that PM was produced only in the blood-fed mosquitoes. The infected blood meal induced the mosquitoes to produce PM in their midgut earlier and thicker than in mosquitoes with blood alone. The initial evidence of PM occurred at 1 h post-blood meal (PBM) as a matrix-like structure. By 6 h PBM, PM had become a layer, which persisted at 12 h. Among mosquitoes fed with blood alone, this structure was found only from 6 and 12 h PBM. Dengue virus type 2 induced different modifications of mosquito PM construction and structures, confirmed under an electron microscope.

TI  - Perturbation in the Conserved Methyltransferase-Polymerase Interface of Flavivirus NS5 Differentially Affects Polymerase Initiation and Elongation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 249
EP  - 261
AB  - ABSTRACT The flavivirus NS5 is a natural fusion of a methyltransferase (MTase) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Analogous to DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, the NS5 polymerase initiates RNA synthesis through a de novo mechanism and then makes a transition to a processive elongation phase. However, whether and how the MTase affects polymerase activities through intramolecular interactions remain elusive. By solving the crystal structure of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) NS5, we recently identified an MTase-RdRP interface containing a set of six hydrophobic residues highly conserved among flaviviruses. To dissect the functional relevance of this interface, we made a series of JEV NS5 constructs with mutations of these hydrophobic residues and/or with the N-terminal first 261 residues and other residues up to the first 303 residues deleted. Compared to the wild-type (WT) NS5, full-length NS5 variants exhibited consistent up- or downregulation of the initiation activities in two types of polymerase assays. Five representative full-length NS5 constructs were then tested in an elongation assay, from which the apparent single-nucleotide incorporation rate constant was estimated. Interestingly, two constructs exhibited different elongation kinetics from the WT NS5, with an effect rather opposite to what was observed at initiation. Moreover, constructs with MTase and/or the linker region (residues 266 to 275) removed still retained polymerase activities, albeit at overall lower levels. However, further removal of the N-terminal extension (residues 276 to 303) abolished regular template-directed synthesis. Together, our data showed that the MTase-RdRP interface is relevant in both polymerase initiation and elongation, likely with different regulation mechanisms in these two major phases of RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE The flavivirus NS5 is very unique in having a methyltransferase (MTase) placed on the immediate N terminus of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). We recently solved the crystal structure of the full-length NS5, which revealed a conserved interface between MTase and RdRP. Building on this discovery, here we carried out in vitro polymerase assays to address the functional relevance of the interface interactions. By explicitly probing polymerase initiation and elongation activities, we found that perturbation in the MTase-RdRP interface had different impacts on different phases of synthesis, suggesting that the roles and contribution of the interface interactions may change upon phase transitions. By comparing the N-terminal-truncated enzymes with the full-length NS5, we collected data to indicate the indispensability to regular polymerase activities of a region that was functionally unclarified previously. Taken together, we provide biochemical evidence and mechanistic insights for the cross talk between the two enzyme modules of flavivirus NS5.

TI  - Perturbed cholesterol and vesicular trafficking associated with dengue blocking in Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti cells
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 8
AB  - Wolbachia are intracellular maternally inherited bacteria that can spread through insect populations and block virus transmission by mosquitoes, providing an important approach to dengue control. To better understand the mechanisms of virus inhibition, we here perform proteomic quantification of the effects of Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti mosquito cells and midgut. Perturbations are observed in vesicular trafficking, lipid metabolism and in the endoplasmic reticulum that could impact viral entry and replication. Wolbachia-infected cells display a differential cholesterol profile, including elevated levels of esterified cholesterol, that is consistent with perturbed intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Cyclodextrins have been shown to reverse lipid accumulation defects in cells with disrupted cholesterol homeostasis. Treatment of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti cells with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin restores dengue replication in Wolbachia-carrying cells, suggesting dengue is inhibited in Wolbachia-infected cells by localised cholesterol accumulation. These results demonstrate parallels between the cellular Wolbachia viral inhibition phenotype and lipid storage genetic disorders. Wolbachia infection of mosquitoes can block dengue virus infection and is tested in field trials, but the mechanism of action is unclear. Using proteomics, Geoghegan et al. here identify effects of Wolbachia on cholesterol homeostasis and dengue virus replication in Aedes aegypti.

TI  - Pervasive tertiary structure in the dengue virus RNA genome
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 115

EP  - 11518
AB  - Significance RNA viruses usurp and reprogram host cells using short RNA genomes. RNA viruses encode the information required for their replication in both their primary sequences and higher-order structures formed when the RNA genome strand folds back on itself, but the extent of higher-order structure has remained unclear. We use a new high-throughput RNA structure probing technology to identify RNA regions with tertiary folds and discover that roughly one-third of the dengue virus RNA genome forms higher-order interactions, many in regions functionally important for replication. This work suggests that tertiary structure elements might be common in large RNAs, and that these regions might contain pockets targetable by small molecules in the design of antiviral therapeutics. RNA virus genomes are efficient and compact carriers of biological information, encoding information required for replication both in their primary sequences and in higher-order RNA structures. However, the ubiquity of RNA elements with higher-order folds—in which helices pack together to form complex 3D structures—and the extent to which these elements affect viral fitness are largely unknown. Here we used single-molecule correlated chemical probing to define secondary and tertiary structures across the RNA genome of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2). Higher-order RNA structures are pervasive and involve more than one-third of nucleotides in the DENV2 genomic RNA. These 3D structures promote a compact overall architecture and contribute to viral fitness. Disrupting RNA regions with higher-order structures leads to stable, nonreverting mutants and could guide the development of vaccines based on attenuated RNA viruses. The existence of extensive regions of functional RNA elements with tertiary folds in viral RNAs, and likely many other messenger and noncoding RNAs, means that there are significant regions with pocket-containing surfaces that may serve as novel RNA-directed drug targets.

TI  - Phenotype and functionality of follicular helper T cells in patients with acute dengue infection
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 27
AB  - The association of functionality and phenotype of follicular helper T cells (Tfh) with dengue virus (DENV) specific antibody responses and clinical disease severity has not been well studied. We investigated the phenotype and functionality of Tfh cells and plasmablasts in adult patients (DF = 18, DHF = 22) with acute dengue (day 4 to 8 since onset of fever) of varying severity using multiparametric flowcytometry. The properties of Tfh cells were correlated with viraemia, disease severity, plasmablast responses and DENV-specific serum antibody responses. We further evaluated the kinetics of neutralizing antibodies (Neut50) throughout the course of illness in order to evaluate their association with clinical disease severity and viraemia. Tfh cells (especially those producing IL-21 and co-expressing PD-1 and ICOS) were found to be significantly expanded (p < 0.0001) and highly activated in patients with DHF compared to those with DF. The frequency of Tfh cells significantly correlated with DENV-specific IgG, NS1-specific antibodies and Neut50 antibody titres in patients with DHF but not in those with DF. Although the Neut50 titres increased during the course of acute secondary DENV infection, they showed differences based on serotype. For instance, the Neut50 titres were significantly higher during the latter part of illness in patients with DF compared to DHF in DENV1 infection, while in DENV2, patients with DHF had significantly higher titres. The viral loads during early illness did not correlate with the subsequent rise in the Neut50 antibody titres during any time point of illness. The expansion of Tfh cells is associated with DHF and DENV-specific IgG, NS1-specific and neutralizing antibodies. Neut50 titres did not associate with disease severity or viraemia at the point of first presentation during the febrile phase, but later titres do show differential association with severity in patients with DENV1 compared to DENV2.

TI  - Phosphoproteomic analysis of dengue virus infected U937 cells and identification of pyruvate kinase M2 as a differentially phosphorylated phosphoprotein
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is an arthropod-borne Flavivirus that can cause a range of symptomatic disease in humans. There are four dengue viruses (DENV 1 to 4) and infection with one DENV only provides transient protection against a heterotypic virus. Second infections are often more severe as the disease is potentiated by antibodies from the first infection through a process known as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Phosphorylation is a major post-translational modification that can have marked effects on a number of processes. To date there has been little information on the phosphorylation changes induced by DENV infection. This study aimed to determine global phosphoproteome changes induced by DENV 2 in U937 cells infected under an ADE protocol. A 2-dimensional electrophoretic approach coupled with a phosphoprotein-specific dye and mass spectroscopic analysis identified 15 statistically significant differentially phosphorylated proteins upon DENV 2 infection. One protein identified as significantly differentially phosphorylated, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) was validated. Treatment with a PKM2 inhibitor modestly reduced levels of infection and viral output, but no change was seen in cellular viral protein levels, suggesting that PKM2 acts on exocytic virus release. While the effect of inhibition of PKM2 was relatively modest, the results highlight the need for a greater understanding of the role of phosphoproteins in DENV infection.

TI  - Pichia pastoris-Expressed Dengue 2 Envelope Forms Virus-Like Particles without Pre-Membrane Protein and Induces High Titer Neutralizing Antibodies
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease with a global prevalence. It is caused by four closely-related dengue viruses (DENVs 1–4). A dengue vaccine that can protect against all four viruses is an unmet public health need. Live attenuated vaccine development efforts have encountered unexpected interactions between the vaccine viruses, raising safety concerns. This has emphasized the need to explore non-replicating dengue vaccine options. Virus-like particles (VLPs) which can elicit robust immunity in the absence of infection offer potential promise for the development of non-replicating dengue vaccine alternatives. We have used the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris to develop DENV envelope (E) protein-based VLPs. We designed a synthetic codon-optimized gene, encoding the N-terminal 395 amino acid residues of the DENV-2 E protein. It also included 5’ pre-membrane-derived signal peptide-encoding sequences to ensure proper translational processing, and 3’ 6× His tag-encoding sequences to facilitate purification of the expressed protein. This gene was integrated into the genome of P. pastoris host and expressed under the alcohol oxidase 1 promoter by methanol induction. Recombinant DENV-2 protein, which was present in the insoluble membrane fraction, was extracted and purified using Ni2+-affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. Amino terminal sequencing and detection of glycosylation indicated that DENV-2 E had undergone proper post-translational processing. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of discrete VLPs in the purified protein preparation after dialysis. The E protein present in these VLPs was recognized by two different conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies. Low doses of DENV-2 E VLPs formulated in alum were immunogenic in inbred and outbred mice eliciting virus neutralizing titers >1∶1200 in flow cytometry based assays and protected AG129 mice against lethal challenge (p<0.05). The formation of immunogenic DENV-2 E VLPs in the absence of pre-membrane protein highlights the potential of P. pastoris in developing non-replicating, safe, efficacious and affordable dengue vaccine.

TI  - Plasmacytoid dendritic cells control dengue and Chikungunya virus infections via IRF7-regulated interferon responses
JF  - eLife
VL  - 7
AB  - Type I interferon (IFN-I) responses are critical for the control of RNA virus infections, however, many viruses, including Dengue (DENV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) virus, do not directly activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), robust IFN-I producing cells. Herein, we demonstrated that DENV and CHIKV infected cells are sensed by pDCs, indirectly, resulting in selective IRF7 activation and IFN-I production, in the absence of other inflammatory cytokine responses. To elucidate pDC immunomodulatory functions, we developed a mouse model in which IRF7 signaling is restricted to pDC. Despite undetectable levels of IFN-I protein, pDC-restricted IRF7 signaling controlled both viruses and was sufficient to protect mice from lethal CHIKV infection. Early pDC IRF7-signaling resulted in amplification of downstream antiviral responses, including an accelerated natural killer (NK) cell-mediated type II IFN response. These studies revealed the dominant, yet indirect role of pDC IRF7-signaling in directing both type I and II IFN responses during arbovirus infections.

TI  - Platelet Activating Factor Contributes to Vascular Leak in Acute Dengue Infection
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 9
AB  - Background Although plasma leakage is the hallmark of severe dengue infections, the factors that cause increased vascular permeability have not been identified. As platelet activating factor (PAF) is associated with an increase in vascular permeability in other diseases, we set out to investigate its role in acute dengue infection. Materials and Methods PAF levels were initially assessed in 25 patients with acute dengue infection to determine if they were increased in acute dengue. For investigation of the kinetics of PAF, serial PAF values were assessed in 36 patients. The effect of dengue serum on tight junction protein ZO-1 was determined by using human endothelial cell lines (HUVECs). The effect of dengue serum on and trans-endothelial resistance (TEER) was also measured on HUVECs. Results PAF levels were significantly higher in patients with acute dengue (n = 25; p = 0.001) when compared to healthy individuals (n = 12). In further investigation of the kinetics of PAF in serial blood samples of patients (n = 36), PAF levels rose just before the onset of the critical phase. PAF levels were significantly higher in patients with evidence of vascular leak throughout the course of the illness when compared to those with milder disease. Serum from patients with dengue significantly down-regulated expression of tight junction protein, ZO-1 (p = 0.004), HUVECs. This was significantly inhibited (p = 0.004) by use of a PAF receptor (PAFR) blocker. Serum from dengue patients also significantly reduced TEER and this reduction was also significantly (p = 0.02) inhibited by prior incubation with the PAFR blocker. Conclusion Our results suggest the PAF is likely to be playing a significant role in inducing vascular leak in acute dengue infection which offers a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Platelet Activation and Apoptosis Modulate Monocyte Inflammatory Responses in Dengue
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 193
SP  - 1864
EP  - 1872
AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent human arbovirus disease in the world. Dengue infection has a large spectrum of clinical manifestations, from self-limited febrile illness to severe syndromes accompanied by bleeding and shock. Thrombocytopenia and vascular leak with altered cytokine profiles in plasma are features of severe dengue. Although monocytes have been recognized as important sources of cytokines in dengue, the contributions of platelet–monocyte interactions to inflammatory responses in dengue have not been addressed. Patients with dengue were investigated for platelet–monocyte aggregate formation. Platelet-induced cytokine responses by monocytes and underlying mechanisms were also investigated in vitro. We observed increased levels of platelet–monocyte aggregates in blood samples from patients with dengue, especially patients with thrombocytopenia and increased vascular permeability. Moreover, the exposure of monocytes from healthy volunteers to platelets from patients with dengue induced the secretion of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10 and MCP-1, whereas exposure to platelets from healthy volunteers only induced the secretion of MCP-1. In addition to the well-established modulation of monocyte cytokine responses by activated platelets through P-selectin binding, we found that interaction of monocytes with apoptotic platelets mediate IL-10 secretion through phosphatidylserine recognition in platelet–monocyte aggregates. Moreover, IL-10 secretion required platelet–monocyte contact but not phagocytosis. Together, our results demonstrate that activated and apoptotic platelets aggregate with monocytes during dengue infection and signal specific cytokine responses that may contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue.

TI  - Platelet Reactivity to Zika and Dengue Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1) Assessed by Flow Cytometry, Atomic Force Microscopy, and Quartz Crystal Microbalance.
JF  - International journal of laboratory hematology
AB  - BACKGROUND
Platelets, besides being traditionally associated with hemostasis, have been recently positioned as immune cells. Alterations in platelet number and function have been reported in some viral infections. Zika virus (ZIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV) are arboviruses that encode for a non-structural protein 1 (NS1). NS1 is mainly involved in the viral replication process and can also be secreted by infected cells and has been associated with immune response evasion. The assessment of platelet reactivity against these viral agents and their proteins, through the use of different innovative technologies such as flow cytometry (FC), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), will allow further study of the pathophysiology of these emerging diseases.


AIM
The aim of this study was to assess platelet reactivity to ZIKV and DENV NS1 protein through the use of FC, AFM, and QCM.


METHODS
Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was stimulated with ZIKV and DENV NS1 protein in individual assays. The expression of P-selectin and the activity of the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, platelet activation markers, were assessed by FC, morphological changes were assessed by AFM, and interaction between NS1 protein and platelet were evaluated by QCM.


RESULTS
An increased expression of P-selectin and GP IIb-IIIa activity (p < 0.001) was observed when PRP was stimulated with ZIKV and DENV NS1 proteins. AFM images showed an increase in cell size and the appearance of pseudopods upon stimulation with the viral proteins. QCM results showed a significant increase in the oscillation frequency of the quartz precoated with ZIKV or DENV NS1 when PRP was injected (p < 0.001).


CONCLUSION
FC, AFM, and QCM are techniques that can be used in the study of platelet response to viral structures such as NS1 protein, broadening the range of existing methodologies in the study of these cells. It is imperative to study platelets in arboviral infections to better understand their involvement in these diseases.

AB  - Platelets are now recognized as immunological sentries in the first line of defense that participate in the detection and response to pathogens. This frequently results in a decrease in the number of circulating platelets. Different mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain the thrombocytopenia in patients with severe dengue, one of them is the participation of the non‐structural protein 1 (NS1) of dengue virus (DENV), which can be secreted into circulation during DENV infection and promotes a more efficient infection.

TI  - Platelet activation determines the severity of thrombocytopenia in dengue infection
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Thrombocytopenia is common in patients with dengue virus (DENV) infections. With a focus on understanding the possible mechanism of thrombocytopenia in DENV infections we described a direct correlation between activation and depletion of platelets in patients. Our data showed a sharp decrease in platelet counts at day 4 of fever in patients. The high DENV genome copies in platelets correlated directly with the elevated platelet activation along with increased binding of complement factor C3 and IgG on their surface at day 4. Recovery in platelet count was observed on day 10 through day 6 and 8 with simultaneous decrease in platelet activation markers. Further, our in vitro data supported the above observations describing a concentration-dependent increase in platelet activation by DENV serotype-2. The high copy number of DENV2 genome in the platelet pellet correlated directly with platelet activation, microparticle generation and clot formation. Furthermore the DENV2-activated platelets were phagocytosed in large numbers by the monocytes. The DENV2-mediated lysis and clearance of platelets were abrogated in presence of platelet activation inhibitor, prostacyclin. These observations collectively suggest that platelet activation status is an important determinant of thrombocytopenia in dengue infections. A careful strategy of inactivation of platelets may rescue them from rapid destruction during DENV infections.

VL  - 66 4
SP  - 435
EP  - 41
AB  - Platelets in circulation normally do not adhere to resting endothelial cells. However, in response to vascular injury they adhere to stimulated endothelium and thereby play an essential role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Infection with dengue-2 virus can cause illness accompanied by thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage. Increased adherence of platelets to stimulated endothelial cells could contribute to the thrombocytopenia. In this study, adherence of radioisotopically labeled platelets to 1) unstimulated, 2) lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated, and 3) dengue-2 virus-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was measured in an in vitro assay. Primary HUVEC were cultured in 96-well tissue culture plates in the presence or absence of LPS or dengue-2 virus. These cells were co-incubated with 3H-adenine-labeled fresh platelets for 30 min after which the cells were assayed for adherent platelets. Within 30 min there was maximum adherence of platelets to confluent LPS-stimulated HUVEC (36 +/- 4% over controls; P = 0.005). In comparison, there was a significant increase in adherence to dengue-2 infected HUVEC (78 +/- 7%; P < or = 0.001). Additionally, platelet adherence was visualized using fluorescent microscopy. Dengue-2 infection stimulated the HUVEC as monitored by expression of E-selectin. Platelets that adhered to dengue-2 or LPS-stimulated HUVEC were activated as visualized by dual fluorescent probes. These data demonstrate that human platelets adhere to dengue-2 virus-stimulated HUVEC and this interaction could contribute to the thrombocytopenia observed during infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND
The mechanisms of thrombocytopenia and platelet phagocytosis in dengue illness are not fully understood.


METHODS
A prospective hospital-based study was conducted to examine the relationships between platelet counts, serum thrombopoietin (TPO) levels, and platelet apoptosis and phagocytosis in 81 patients with secondary dengue virus (DV) infections and 38 healthy volunteers. The apoptosis and phagocytosis of cultured platelets after exposure to DV were also examined.


RESULTS
Platelet apoptosis, platelet phagocytosis, and serum TPO levels were increased significantly in patients during the acute and early convalescence phases compared with levels observed in patients during the convalescence phase and in healthy volunteers. A significant correlation between platelet apoptosis and platelet phagocytosis was also observed in these patients. Platelet phagocytosis was inhibited significantly by the D89E mutant, which carries a point mutation in the RGD motif of milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8, a phosphatidylserine-recognizing bridge molecule. DV-induced platelet apoptosis and increased phagocytosis of DV-induced apoptotic platelets was confirmed using in vitro assays.


CONCLUSIONS
Our data suggest an increased phagocytosis of DV-induced apoptotic platelets by macrophages via a phosphatidylserine-recognizing pathway in secondary DV infection. Accelerated platelet clearance, however, was overcome by TPO-induced enhanced thrombopoiesis in these patients.

TI  - Platelet derived exosomes disrupt endothelial cell monolayer integrity and enhance vascular inflammation in dengue patients
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 14
AB  - Background Thrombocytopenia is the most notable phenomenon in dengue. Activation status of platelets and interaction of platelets with endothelium contribute towards dengue disease pathogenesis. Platelets are the major cell types known to release extracellular vesicles, especially exosomes in circulation. However, the role of platelet derived exosomes (PLT-EXOs) in endothelial dysfunction during dengue infection remains unknown. Methods In this study, we recruited 28 healthy subjects and 69 dengue patients categorized as WS- (n=31), WS+ (n=29) and SD (n=9). Platelets were isolated from platelet rich plasma of dengue patients and their activation was assessed by flow cytometry. PLT-EXOs were isolated by ultracentrifugation method. Western blot analyses were performed to characterize the exosomes. Exosome uptake experiment was carried out to see the internalization of exosomes inside endothelial cells (HUVECs). To observe the effect of exosomes on endothelial cells, exosomes were added on HUVECs and expression of adherens and tight junctional proteins were examined by immunofluorescence assay and western blot. Expression levels of vascular injury markers were measured in the culture supernatants of Exosome-HUVEC coculture and sera of dengue patients by MSD-multiplex assay. Results As compared to healthy subjects, CD41/CD61 expression was significantly reduced (p<0.0001) and CD62p expression was significantly increased (p<0.0001) on platelets in dengue patients. PLT-EXOs isolated from the dengue patients showed higher expression of CD63 and CD9 proteins than the healthy subjects. With in-vitro immunofluorescence assays, we illustrated the internalization of PLT-EXOs by the HUVECs and observed disruption of endothelial cell monolayer integrity in the presence of PLT-EXOs from WS+ and SD patients. Furthermore, the significant reduction in the expressions of ZO-2, VE-Cadherin and CD31 in endothelial cells following exposure to PLT-EXOs from the dengue patients provide direct evidence of PLT-EXOs mediated vascular permeability. PLT-EXOs stimulated the release of inflammatory markers CRP, SAA, sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 in the supernatants of HUVEC cells. Importantly, significantly higher levels of CRP, sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 in the sera of severe than mild dengue patients (p<0.0001) suggest their role in disease severity. Conclusions In summary, our data suggest that PLT-EXOs promote vascular leakage via release of proinflammatory mediators and compromise vascular barrier integrity in dengue patients.

TI  - Platelet function alterations in dengue are associated with plasma leakage
JF  - Thrombosis and Haemostasis
VL  - 112
SP  - 352
EP  - 362
AB  - Summary Severe dengue is characterised by thrombocytopenia, plasma leakage and bleeding. Platelets are important for preservation of endothelial integrity. We hypothesised that platelet activation with secondary platelet dysfunction contribute to plasma leakage. In adult Indonesian patients with acute dengue, we measured platelet activation status and the response to the platelet agonist TRAP using flow cytometerbased assays. Patients were monitored daily for plasma leakage by ultrasonography. Acute dengue was associated with platelet activation with an increased expression of the activated fibrinogen receptor (αIIbβ3), the lysosomal marker CD63 and the alpha-granule marker CD62P (P-selectin). Upon maximal platelet activation by TRAP, platelet function defects were observed with a significantly reduced maximal activated αIIbβ3 and CD63 expression and reduced platelet-monocyte and platelet-neutrophil complexes. Patients in the lowest tertile of activated αIIbβ3 and CD63 expression had an odds ratio for plasma leakage of 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–22.7) and 3.9 (95% CI 1.1–13.7), respectively, compared to the highest tertile. Platelet-derived serotonin has previously been related to plasma leakage and we found increased intra-platelet serotonin concentrations in our patients. In conclusion, platelet activation with platelet function alterations can be found in patients with acute dengue and this may contribute to dengue-associated plasma leakage.

TI  - Platelet proteome reveals novel pathways of platelet activation and platelet-mediated immunoregulation in dengue
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent human arbovirus disease worldwide. Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes syndromes varying from self-limiting febrile illness to severe dengue. Although dengue pathophysiology is not completely understood, it is widely accepted that increased inflammation plays important roles in dengue pathogenesis. Platelets are blood cells classically known as effectors of hemostasis which have been increasingly recognized to have major immune and inflammatory activities. Nevertheless, the phenotype and effector functions of platelets in dengue pathogenesis are not completely understood. Here we used quantitative proteomics to investigate the protein content of platelets in clinical samples from patients with dengue compared to platelets from healthy donors. Our assays revealed a set of 252 differentially abundant proteins. In silico analyses associated these proteins with key molecular events including platelet activation and inflammatory responses, and with events not previously attributed to platelets during dengue infection including antigen processing and presentation, proteasome activity, and expression of histones. From these results, we conducted functional assays using samples from a larger cohort of patients and demonstrated evidence for platelet activation indicated by P-selectin (CD62P) translocation and secretion of granule-stored chemokines by platelets. In addition, we found evidence that DENV infection triggers HLA class I synthesis and surface expression by a mechanism depending on functional proteasome activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cell-free histone H2A released during dengue infection binds to platelets, increasing platelet activation. These findings are consistent with functional importance of HLA class I, proteasome subunits, and histones that we found exclusively in proteome analysis of platelets in samples from dengue patients. Our study provides the first in-depth characterization of the platelet proteome in dengue, and sheds light on new mechanisms of platelet activation and platelet-mediated immune and inflammatory responses.

TI  - Platelets in Immune Response to Virus and Immunopathology of Viral Infections
JF  - Frontiers in Medicine
VL  - 5
AB  - Platelets are essential effector cells in hemostasis. Aside from their role in coagulation, platelets are now recognized as major inflammatory cells with key roles in the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Activated platelets have key thromboinflammatory functions linking coagulation to immune responses in various infections, including in response to virus. Recent studies have revealed that platelets exhibit several pattern recognition receptors (PRR) including those from the toll-like receptor, NOD-like receptor, and C-type lectin receptor family and are first-line sentinels in detecting and responding to pathogens in the vasculature. Here, we review the main mechanisms of platelets interaction with viruses, including their ability to sustain viral infection and replication, their expression of specialized PRR, and activation of thromboinflammatory responses against viruses. Finally, we discuss the role of platelet-derived mediators and platelet interaction with vascular and immune cells in protective and pathophysiologic responses to dengue, influenza, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 infections.

AB  - Abstract Dengue virus (DENV) infection is responsible for the development of dengue illness, which can be either asymptomatic, present mild manifestations or evolve to severe dengue. Thrombocytopenia is an important characteristic during DENV infection, being observed both in mild and severe dengue, although the lowest platelet counts are encountered during severe cases. This review gathers information regarding several mechanisms that have been related to alterations in platelet number and function, leading to thrombocytopenia but also platelet-mediated immune and inflammatory response. On this regard, we highlight that the decrease in platelet counts may be due to bone marrow suppression or consumption of platelets at the periphery. We discuss the infection of hematopoietic progenitors and stromal cells as mechanisms involved in bone marrow suppression. Concerning peripheral consumption of platelets, we addressed the direct infection of platelets by DENV, adhesion of platelets to leukocytes and vascular endothelium and platelet clearance mediated by anti-platelet antibodies. We also focused on platelet involvement on the dengue immunity and pathogenesis through translation and secretion of viral and host factors and through platelet-leukocyte aggregates formation. Hence, the present review highlights important findings related to platelet activation and thrombocytopenia during dengue infection, and also exhibits different mechanisms associated with decreased platelet counts. Graphical abstract: Schematic mechanistic representation of platelet-mediated immune responses and thrombocytopenia during dengue infection. (A) DENV-infected platelets secrete cytokines and chemokines and also adhere to activated vascular endothelium. Platelets aggregate with leukocytes, inducing the secretion of NETs and inflammatory mediators by neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. (B) DENV directly infects stromal cells and hematopoietic precursors, including megakaryocytes, which compromises megakaryopoiesis. Both central and peripheric mechanisms contribute to DENV-associated thrombocytopenia. Graphical abstract

JF  - Blood
VL  - 122 20
SP  - 3405
EP  - 14
AB  - Dengue is the most frequent hemorrhagic viral disease and re-emergent infection in the world. Although thrombocytopenia is characteristically observed in mild and severe forms of dengue, the role of platelet activation in dengue pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesize that platelets have major roles in inflammatory amplification and increased vascular permeability during severe forms of dengue. Here we investigate interleukin (IL)-1β synthesis, processing, and secretion in platelets during dengue virus (DV) infection and potential contribution of these events to endothelial permeability during infection. We observed increased expression of IL-1β in platelets and platelet-derived microparticles from patients with dengue or after platelet exposure to DV in vitro. We demonstrated that DV infection leads to assembly of nucleotide-binding domain leucine rich repeat containing protein (NLRP3) inflammasomes, activation of caspase-1, and caspase-1-dependent IL-1β secretion. Our findings also indicate that platelet-derived IL-1β is chiefly released in microparticles through mechanisms dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species-triggered NLRP3 inflammasomes. Inflammasome activation and platelet shedding of IL-1β-rich microparticles correlated with signs of increased vascular permeability. Moreover, microparticles from DV-stimulated platelets induced enhanced permeability in vitro in an IL-1-dependent manner. Our findings provide new evidence that platelets contribute to increased vascular permeability in DV infection by inflammasome-dependent release of IL-1β.

EP  - 207
AB  - Abstract Evolving evidence demonstrates that platelets have major roles in viral syndromes through previously unrecognized viral sensing and effector functions. Activated platelets and increased platelet-leukocyte aggregates are observed in clinical and experimental viral infections. The mechanisms and outcomes of platelet–leukocyte interactions depend on the interacting leukocyte as well as on the pathogen and pathological conditions. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms involved in platelet interactions with leukocytes and its functions during viral infections. We focus on the contributions of human platelet–leukocyte interactions to pathophysiological and protective responses during viral infections of major global health relevance, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), influenza pneumonia, and COVID-19.

TI  - Polarization of Type 1 Macrophages Is Associated with the Severity of Viral Encephalitis Caused by Japanese Encephalitis Virus and Dengue Virus
JF  - Cells
VL  - 10
AB  - Infection with flaviviruses causes mild to severe diseases, including viral hemorrhagic fever, vascular shock syndrome, and viral encephalitis. Several animal models explore the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis, as shown by neuron destruction due to neurotoxicity after viral infection. While neuronal cells are injuries caused by inflammatory cytokine production following microglial/macrophage activation, the blockade of inflammatory cytokines can reduce neurotoxicity to improve the survival rate. This study investigated the involvement of macrophage phenotypes in facilitating CNS inflammation and neurotoxicity during flavivirus infection, including the Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus. Mice infected with different flaviviruses presented encephalitis-like symptoms, including limbic seizure and paralysis. Histology indicated that brain lesions were identified in the hippocampus and surrounded by mononuclear cells. In those regions, both the infiltrated macrophages and resident microglia were significantly increased. RNA-seq analysis showed the gene profile shifting toward type 1 macrophage (M1) polarization, while M1 markers validated this phenomenon. Pharmacologically blocking C-C chemokine receptor 2 and tumor necrosis factor-α partly retarded DENV-induced M1 polarization. In summary, flavivirus infection, such as JEV and DENV, promoted type 1 macrophage polarization in the brain associated with encephalitic severity.

TI  - Poly(A)-binding protein binds to the non-polyadenylated 3' untranslated region of dengue virus and modulates translation efficiency.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 90 Pt 3
SP  - 687
EP  - 92
AB  - Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is a key player in mRNA circularization and translation initiation of polyadenylated mRNAs. It simultaneously binds the 3' poly(A) tail of an mRNA and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), which forms part of the translation initiation complex assembling at the 5'end, thus circularizing the RNA molecule and enhancing translation initiation. Here, we report the binding of PABP to the non-polyadenylated 3'end of dengue virus (DENV) RNA. PABP binds the DENV 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) internally, upstream of the conserved 3'stem-loop near the two dumb-bell structures, and can be displaced by poly(A) RNA. The PABP-specific translation inhibitor PABP-interacting protein 2 (Paip2) interferes with the DENV 3'UTR-PABP interaction, and in vitro translation of DENV reporter RNAs in baby hamster kidney cell extracts is inhibited by Paip2 in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings show an expanded translation mechanism for PABP, binding to a viral RNA lacking a terminal poly(A) tail.

TI  - Polymorphism of DC-SIGN (CD209) promoter in association with clinical symptoms of dengue fever.
JF  - Viral immunology
VL  - 27 5
SP  - 245
EP  - 9
AB  - C-type lectin DC-SIGN receptor, encoded by CD209, plays a key role in the infection of dendritic cells by dengue virus (DENV). Because the -336A/G SNP (rs4804803) polymorphism in the promoter of CD209 modulates DC-SIGN expression, we investigated the putative association of this polymorphism with DENV infection and its pathogenesis. A control sample of 72 individuals, rigorously selected through a clinical investigation for absence of past dengue fever (DF) was compared to a sample of 168 patients (156 classical DF; 12 dengue hemorrhagic fever), all residents from Pará, Brazil. However, the prevalence of symptoms showed a trend higher in the AA genotype (Wilcoxon test; Z=2.02; p=0.04). Hence, our findings indicate that the G allele downregulates the spectrum of symptoms during the early acute phase of DENV infection, putatively decreasing the viremia, as suggested in the literature.

TI  - Polymorphisms of Transporter Associated with Antigen Presentation, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α and Interleukin-10 and their Implications for Protection and Susceptibility to Severe Forms of Dengue Fever in Patients in Sri Lanka
JF  - Journal of Global Infectious Diseases
VL  - 7
SP  - 157
EP  - 164
AB  - Context: To date, a clear understanding of dengue disease pathogenesis remains elusive. Some infected individuals display no symptoms while others develop severe life-threatening forms of the disease. It is widely believed that host genetic factors influence dengue severity. Aims: This study evaluates the relationship between certain polymorphisms and dengue severity in Sri Lankan patients. Settings and Design: Polymorphism studies are carried out on genes for; transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP), promoter of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and promoter of interleukin-10 (IL-10). In other populations, TAP1 (333), TAP2 (379), TNF-α (−308), and IL-10 (−1082, −819, −592) have been associated with dengue and a number of different diseases. Data have not been collected previously for these polymorphisms for dengue patients in Sri Lanka. Materials and Methods: The polymorphisms were typed by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction in 107 dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) patients together with 62 healthy controls. Statistical Analysis Used: Pearson's Chi-square contingency table analysis with Yates′ correction. Results: Neither the TAP nor the IL-10 polymorphisms considered individually can define dengue disease outcome with regard to severity. However, the genotype combination, IL-10 (−592/−819/−1082) CCA/ATA was significantly associated with development of severe dengue in these patients, suggesting a risk factor to developing DHF. Also, identified is the genotype combination IL-10 (−592/−819/−1082) ATA/ATG which suggested a possibility for protection from DHF. The TNF-α (−308) GG genotype was also significantly associated with severe dengue, suggesting a significant risk factor. Conclusions: The results reported here are specific to the Sri Lankan population. Comparisons with previous reports imply that data may vary from population to population.

AB  - The 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the dengue virus (DENV) genome contain several sequences required for translation, replication and cyclization processes. This region also binds cellular proteins such as La, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), Y box-binding protein 1, poly(A)-binding protein and the translation initiation factor eEF-1 alpha. PTB is a cellular protein that interacts with the regulatory sequences of positive-strand RNA viruses such as several picornaviruses and hepatitis C virus. In the present report, it was demonstrated that PTB translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during DENV infection. At 48 h post-infection, PTB, as well as the DENV proteins NS1 and NS3, were found to co-localize with the endoplasmic reticulum marker calnexin. Silencing of PTB expression inhibited virus translation and replication, whilst overexpression of PTB augmented these processes. Thus, these results provide evidence that, during infection, PTB moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and plays an important role in the DENV replicative cycle.

TI  - Polyubiquitin protein of Aedes aegypti as an interacting partner of dengue virus envelope protein
JF  - Medical and Veterinary Entomology
VL  - 38
SP  - 48
EP  - 58
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is an arbovirus that comprises four antigenically different serotypes. Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) acts as the principal vector for DENV transmission, and vector control is crucial for dengue fever epidemic management. To design effective vector control strategies, a comprehensive understanding of the insect vector and virus interaction is required. Female Ae. aegypti ingests DENV during the acquisition of a blood meal from an infected human. DENV enters the insect midgut, replicates inside it and reaches the salivary gland for transmitting DENV to healthy humans during the subsequent feeding cycles. DENV must interact with the proteins present in the midgut and salivary glands to gain entry and accomplish successful replication and transmission. Ae. aegypti midgut cDNA library was prepared, and yeast two‐hybrid screening was performed against the envelope protein domain III (EDIII) protein of DENV‐2. The polyubiquitin protein was selected from the various candidate proteins for subsequent analysis. Polyubiquitin gene was amplified, and the protein was purified in a heterologous expression system for in vitro interaction studies. In vitro pull‐down assay presented a clear interaction between polyubiquitin protein and EDIII. To further confirm this interaction, a dot blot assay was employed, and polyubiquitin protein was found to interact with DENV particles. Our results enable us to suggest that polyubiquitin plays an important role in DENV infection within mosquitoes.

TI  - Positive-sense RNA viruses reveal the complexity and dynamics of the cellular and viral epitranscriptomes during infection
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research

EP  - 5791
AB  - Abstract More than 140 post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) are known to decorate cellular RNAs, but their incidence, identity and significance in viral RNA are still largely unknown. We have developed an agnostic analytical approach to comprehensively survey PTMs on viral and cellular RNAs. Specifically, we used mass spectrometry to analyze PTMs on total RNA isolated from cells infected with Zika virus, Dengue virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), poliovirus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. All five RNA viruses significantly altered global PTM landscapes. Examination of PTM profiles of individual viral genomes isolated by affinity capture revealed a plethora of PTMs on viral RNAs, which far exceeds the handful of well-characterized modifications. Direct comparison of viral epitranscriptomes identified common and virus-specific PTMs. In particular, specific dimethylcytosine modifications were only present in total RNA from virus-infected cells, and in intracellular HCV RNA, and viral RNA from Zika and HCV virions. Moreover, dimethylcytosine abundance during viral infection was modulated by the cellular DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX6. By opening the Pandora’s box on viral PTMs, this report presents numerous questions and hypotheses on PTM function and strongly supports PTMs as a new tier of regulation by which RNA viruses subvert the host and evade cellular surveillance systems.

VL  - 96 Pt 7
SP  - 1551
EP  - 69
AB  - Flaviviruses are a group of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that generally circulate between arthropod vectors and susceptible vertebrate hosts, producing significant human and veterinary disease burdens. Intensive research efforts have broadened our scientific understanding of the replication cycles of these viruses and have revealed several elegant and tightly co-ordinated post-translational modifications that regulate the activity of viral proteins. The three structural proteins in particular - capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) - are subjected to strict regulatory modifications as they progress from translation through virus particle assembly and egress. The timing of proteolytic cleavage events at the C-prM junction directly influences the degree of genomic RNA packaging into nascent virions. Proteolytic maturation of prM by host furin during Golgi transit facilitates rearrangement of the E proteins at the virion surface, exposing the fusion loop and thus increasing particle infectivity. Specific interactions between the prM and E proteins are also important for particle assembly, as prM acts as a chaperone, facilitating correct conformational folding of E. It is only once prM/E heterodimers form that these proteins can be secreted efficiently. The addition of branched glycans to the prM and E proteins during virion transit also plays a key role in modulating the rate of secretion, pH sensitivity and infectivity of flavivirus particles. The insights gained from research into post-translational regulation of structural proteins are beginning to be applied in the rational design of improved flavivirus vaccine candidates and make attractive targets for the development of novel therapeutics.

TI  - Potential Phosphorylation of Viral Nonstructural Protein 1 in Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes a spectrum of dengue diseases that have unclear underlying mechanisms. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional protein of DENV that is involved in DENV infection and dengue pathogenesis. This study investigated the potential post-translational modification of DENV NS1 by phosphorylation following DENV infection. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), 24 potential phosphorylation sites were identified in both cell-associated and extracellular NS1 proteins from three different cell lines infected with DENV. Cell-free kinase assays also demonstrated kinase activity in purified preparations of DENV NS1 proteins. Further studies were conducted to determine the roles of specific phosphorylation sites on NS1 proteins by site-directed mutagenesis with alanine substitution. The T27A and Y32A mutations had a deleterious effect on DENV infectivity. The T29A, T230A, and S233A mutations significantly decreased the production of infectious DENV but did not affect relative levels of intracellular DENV NS1 expression or NS1 secretion. Only the T230A mutation led to a significant reduction of detectable DENV NS1 dimers in virus-infected cells; however, none of the mutations interfered with DENV NS1 oligomeric formation. These findings highlight the importance of DENV NS1 phosphorylation that may pave the way for future target-specific antiviral drug design.

TI  - PrM- and Cell-Binding Domains of the Dengue Virus E Protein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 73

EP  - 2551
AB  - ABSTRACT The E-prM proteins of flaviviruses are unusual complexes which play important roles in virus assembly and fusion modulation and in potential immunity-inducing vaccines. Despite their importance, little is known about the biogenesis and structural organization of E-prM complexes. Pulse-chase radiolabeling of dengue virus-infected Vero cells demonstrated a rapid interassociation of E and prM proteins, and sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis suggested that E-prM complexes progressed from simple heteromers to more densely sedimenting structures indicating increased multimerization. E-prM heteromers of even higher complexity were observed in virus particles, suggesting an intracellular assembly process which results in the networking of E-prM subunits into a lattice-like structure found in virus particles. Trypsin cleavage of E-prM-containing virus particles resulted in the release of a soluble 45-kDa fragment of the E protein which retained cell-binding activity. The results suggest that E-prM interactions in dengue virus particles are largely mediated by domains in the carboxy-terminal anchoring domain of E, while cell-binding activity is retained in a trypsin-releasable ectodomain of the E protein.

AB  - ABSTRACT Understanding the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) requires the precise identification of dengue virus (DV)-permissive target cells. In a previous study using unfractionated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we found that monocytes, but not B or T cells, were the principal DV-permissive cells in the absence of DV-immune pooled human sera (PHS) and the major mediators of antibody-dependent enhancement in the presence of PHS. To further identify DV-permissive target cells in other tissues and organs, we isolated human splenic mononuclear cells (MNCs), inoculated them with DV type 2 (strain 16681) in the presence or absence of PHS, and assessed their infection either directly using flow cytometry and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays or indirectly by plaque assay. We found that in the absence of PHS, a small proportion of splenic macrophages appeared to be positive for DV antigens in comparison to staining controls by the flow cytometric assay (0.77% ± 1.00% versus 0.18% ± 0.12%; P = 0.07) and that viral RNA was detectable by the RT-PCR assay in MNCs exposed to DV. Additionally, supernatants from cultures of DV-exposed MNCs contained infectious virions that were readily detectable by plaque assay. The magnitude of infection was significantly enhanced in splenic macrophages in the presence of highly diluted PHS (5.41% ± 3.53% versus 0.77% ± 1.00%; P = 0.001). In contrast, primary T and B cells were not infected in either the presence or absence of PHS. These results provide evidence, for the first time, that human primary splenic macrophages, rather than B or T cells, are the principal DV-permissive cells in the spleen and that they may be uniquely important in the initial steps of immune enhancement that leads to DHF/DSS in some DV-infected individuals.

TI  - Primary and secondary dengue virus infections elicit similar memory B cell responses but breadth to other serotypes and cross-reactivity to Zika virus is higher in secondary dengue.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
AB  - BACKGROUND
The four antigenically distinct serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) share extensive homology with each other and with the closely related Zika flavivirus (ZIKV). The development of polyclonal memory B cells (MBCs) to the four DENV serotypes and ZIKV during DENV infection is not fully understood.


METHODS
Here we analyzed polyclonal MBCs at the single-cell level from peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected ~2 weeks or 6-7 months post-primary or post-secondary DENV infection from a pediatric hospital-based study in Nicaragua using a Multi-Color FluoroSpot assay.


RESULTS
DENV elicits robust type-specific and cross-reactive MBC responses after primary and secondary DENV infection, with a significantly higher cross-reactive response in both. Reactivity to the infecting serotype dominated the total MBC response. While the frequency and proportion of type-specific and cross-reactive MBCs were comparable between primary and secondary DENV infections, within the cross-reactive response, the breadth of MBC responses against different serotypes was greater after secondary DENV infection. DENV infection also induced cross-reactive MBC responses recognizing ZIKV, particularly after secondary DENV infection.


CONCLUSIONS
Overall, our study sheds light on the polyclonal MBC response to DENV and ZIKV in naïve and DENV-pre-immune subjects, with important implications for natural infections and vaccine development.

EP  - 11
AB  - The NS3 (dengue virus non-structural protein 3) serine protease of dengue virus is an essential component for virus maturation, thus representing an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs directed at the inhibition of polyprotein processing. In the present study, we have investigated determinants of substrate specificity of the dengue virus NS3 protease by using internally quenched fluorogenic peptides containing Abz (o-aminobenzoic acid; synonymous to anthranilic acid) and 3-nitrotyrosine (nY) representing both native and chimaeric polyprotein cleavage site sequences. By using this combinatorial approach, we were able to describe the substrate preferences and determinants of specificity for the dengue virus NS2B(H)-NS3pro protease. Kinetic parameters (kcat/K(m)) for the hydrolysis of peptide substrates with systematic truncations at the prime and non-prime side revealed a length preference for peptides spanning the P4-P3' residues, and the peptide Abz-RRRRSAGnY-amide based on the dengue virus capsid protein processing site was discovered as a novel and efficient substrate of the NS3 protease (kcat/K(m)=11087 M(-1) x s(-1)). Thus, while having confirmed the exclusive preference of the NS3 protease for basic residues at the P1 and P2 positions, we have also shown that the presence of basic amino acids at the P3 and P4 positions is a major specificity-determining feature of the dengue virus NS3 protease. Investigation of the substrate peptide Abz-KKQRAGVLnY-amide based on the NS2B/NS3 polyprotein cleavage site demonstrated an unexpected high degree of cleavage efficiency. Chimaeric peptides with combinations of prime and non-prime sequences spanning the P4-P4' positions of all five native polyprotein cleavage sites revealed a preponderant effect of non-prime side residues on the K(m) values, whereas variations at the prime side sequences had higher impact on kcat.

JF  - Virology
VL  - 204 2
SP  - 526
EP  - 40
AB  - The flavivirus structural proteins capsid (C), premembrane (prM), and envelope (E) are cleaved in that order from the N-terminus of the polyprotein by the ER intralumenal enzyme signal peptidase. The prM-E and E-NS1 junctions contain hydrophobic domains with both transmembrane and signal function. These domains reside at the C-termini of prM and E, respectively, after cleavage. We studied the functions of the 37-amino-acid C-terminus of the dengue virus type 4 (DEN4) prM (amino acids 243-279 of the DEN4 polyprotein) in the processing of prM and E. Hydrophobicity in this domain is interrupted by a conserved Arg residue (Arg-264) within a short amphipathic segment. Hydrophobic amino acids upstream from Arg-264 (aa 243-263) were presumed to constitute the membrane anchor for prM (the "tm" segment). Previous results had suggested that sequences downstream from Arg-264 (aa 265-279) constitute the E signal peptide. RNA transcripts prepared from wild-type (wt) and deletion-mutant DEN4 cDNAs encoding the prM signal peptide, prM, E, and the N-terminus of the nonstructural glycoprotein, NS1, were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of microsomes. Processing of wt prM and E in vitro appeared to mimic processing occurring during flavivirus infection. Analysis of mutants confirmed the localization of the E signal peptide within residues 265 to 279. However, deletions within either the E signal peptide or the tm segment resulted in a defect in both membrane insertion of prM and cleavage of the prM-E junction. Membrane anchoring of prM appeared to be a two-step process requiring function of both the tm segment and the E signal peptide, and fully efficient prM-E cleavage was also dependent upon the integrity of both hydrophobic domains. We propose a model for the processing of the flavivirus structural glycoproteins based on these results.

AB  - A glycoprotein C-prM of 35,000 M(r) was immuno-precipitated from lysates of Aedes albopictus cells infected with dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2) using antisera directed against the C protein or an amino-terminal fragment of the prM glycoprotein. C-prM was not detected in infected Vero cells. The prM glycoprotein synthesized in infected A. albopictus and Vero cells was cleaved to produce the membrane-associated virion protein (M) and the non-M fragment (pr) immediately preceding or occurring simultaneously with the release of viral particles from cells. The cleavage was less efficient in mosquito cells. The pr fragment was found only in the medium and was not rapidly degraded. To obtain pr-specific and M-specific antisera for these studies, proteins containing fragments of DEN-2 prM fused with staphylococcal Protein A were synthesized in Escherichia coli using the expression vector pRIT2T. The fusion proteins were stable and were used to raise antisera in rabbits for immunoprecipitation of radiolabelled cell extracts and culture medium. This is the first report of the detection of a C-prM protein in flavivirus-infected cells and the identification of the pr component of prM.

DENV first establishes infection in the midgut of Aedes aegypti and spreads to various mosquito organs for lifelong infection. Curiously, studies have shown that infectious DENV titers peak and decrease thereafter in the midgut despite relatively stable viral genome levels. However, the mechanisms that regulate this decoupling of infectious virion production from viral RNA replication have never been determined. We show here that the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) plays an important role in regulating infectious DENV production. Using RNA interference studies, we show in vivo that knockdown of selected UPP components reduced infectious virus production without altering viral RNA replication in the midgut. Furthermore, this decoupling effect could also be observed after RNAi knockdown in the head/thorax of the mosquito, which otherwise showed direct correlation between infectious DENV titer and viral RNA levels. The dependence on the UPP for successful DENV production is further reinforced by the observed up-regulation of key UPP molecules upon DENV infection that overcome the relatively low expression of these genes after a blood meal. Collectively, our findings indicate an important role for the UPP in regulating DENV production in the mosquito vector.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 69 ( Pt 2)
SP  - 445
EP  - 9
AB  - Human monocytes appear to be very important in the pathogenesis of dengue infection. They are thought to be the most active sites of virus replication during dengue infection. We have analysed interferon (IFN) production by dengue virus from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). IFN activity was first detected at 12 h after infection of monocytes and reached a maximum level by 48 h. Non-adherent PBMC depleted of monocytes did not produce detectable levels of IFN, and did not contain dengue antigen-positive cells after exposure to dengue virus. The IFN produced was characterized as IFN-alpha by neutralization tests using specific antisera to HuIFN-alpha, HuIFN-beta and HuIFN-gamma, and by radioimmunoassay. The culture fluids of dengue virus-infected monocytes, which contained IFN-alpha, were able to inhibit infection of human monocytes by dengue virus. These results suggest that IFN-alpha produced by dengue virus-infected monocytes may play an important role in controlling primary dengue virus infection.

EP  - 7
AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever-dengue shock syndrome, the most severe manifestation of an acute dengue virus (DV) infection, is endemic in Southeast Asia. Antibody-dependent enhancement of DV growth in mononuclear phagocytes is thought to be the mechanism whereby preexisting dengue antibodies confer excess risk for this outcome. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) may play an important role in the pathogenetic mechanisms that cause dengue fever and shock. It was shown that both IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha are secreted from monocytes within 4 h after DV infection. However, there was no increase in IL-1 secretion by virus-stimulated monocytes from dengue fever patients compared with healthy controls. Significant amounts of IL-1 were secreted by DV-infected monocytes in the presence of aggregated immunoglobulin or immune complexes. In addition, a new 600-kDa IL-1 inhibitor from the supernatants of DV-infected monocytes was identified. This inhibitor may cause immunosuppression and influence the process of DV infection.

TI  - Production of nitrite by dengue virus‐induced cytotoxic factor
JF  - Clinical & Experimental Immunology
VL  - 104
AB  - Dengue type 2 virus (DV) infection induces production of a cytokine, the cytotoxic factor (CF) in the spleen of mice. The present study was undertaken to investigate the production of nitrite (NO−2) by the spleen cells of mice in vitro and in vivo following inoculation of DV or CF. Maximum NO−2 production occurred at 45 min after inoculation of 5 μg CF, both in vitro and in vivo. The NO−2 was produced by macrophages and T cells and not by B cells. Pretreatment of CF with anti‐CF antisera inhibited production of NO−2. DV‐stimulated spleen cell culture supernatants showed peak production of CF and NO−2 at 72 h. In DV‐infected mouse spleen, maximum NO−2 production occurred at 8–11 days post‐infection, which correlated with peak cytotoxic activity in the spleen. Pretreatment of spleen cells with NG‐monomethyl l‐arginine (NMMA) inhibited NO−2 production. NO−2 production was abrogated in a dose‐dependent manner by treatment of spleen cells with Ca2+ channel blocking drug, Nifedipine. The findings demonstrate that DV‐induced CF induces production of NO−2 in spleen cells, probably in a Ca2+‐dependent manner, and may be a mechanism of target cell killing.

TI  - Productive Dengue Virus Infection of Human Endothelial Cells Is Directed by Heparan Sulfate-Containing Proteoglycan Receptors
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 9478
EP  - 9485
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus causes leakage of the vascular endothelium, resulting in dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The endothelial cell lining of the vasculature regulates capillary permeability and is altered by immune and chemokine responses which affect fluid barrier functions of the endothelium. Our findings indicate that human endothelial cells are highly susceptible to infection by dengue virus (type 4). We found that dengue virus productively infects ∼80% of primary human endothelial cells, resulting in the rapid release of ∼105 virions 1 day postinfection. Analysis of potential inhibitors of dengue virus entry demonstrated that antibodies and ligands to integrins and cellular receptors were unable to inhibit dengue virus infection of endothelial cells. In contrast, pretreating cells with heparin or heparan sulfate resulted in a 60 to 80% reduction in dengue virus-infected cells, and pretreatment of endothelial cells with heparinase III or protease reduced dengue infectivity by >80%. Dengue virus bound specifically to resin immobilized heparin, and binding was competitively inhibited by excess heparin but not other ligands. Collectively, these findings suggest that dengue virus specifically attaches to heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycan receptors on endothelial cells. Following attachment to human endothelial cell receptors, dengue virus causes a highly productive infection that has the potential to increase viral dissemination and viremia. This provides the potential for dengue virus-infected endothelial cells to directly alter barrier functions of the endothelium, contribute to enhancement of immune cell activation, and serve as potential targets of immune responses which play a central role in dengue pathogenesis.

TI  - Progress in the Identification of Dengue Virus Entry/Fusion Inhibitors
JF  - BioMed Research International
VL  - 2014
AB  - Dengue fever, a reemerging disease, is putting nearly 2.5 billion people at risk worldwide. The number of infections and the geographic extension of dengue fever infection have increased in the past decade. The disease is caused by the dengue virus, a flavivirus that uses mosquitos Aedes sp. as vectors. The disease has several clinical manifestations, from the mild cold-like illness to the more serious hemorrhagic dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome. Currently, there is no approved drug for the treatment of dengue disease or an effective vaccine to fight the virus. Therefore, the search for antivirals against dengue virus is an active field of research. As new possible receptors and biological pathways of the virus biology are discovered, new strategies are being undertaken to identify possible antiviral molecules. Several groups of researchers have targeted the initial step in the infection as a potential approach to interfere with the virus. The viral entry process is mediated by viral proteins and cellular receptor molecules that end up in the endocytosis of the virion, the fusion of both membranes, and the release of viral RNA in the cytoplasm. This review provides an overview of the targets and progress that has been made in the quest for dengue virus entry inhibitors.

TI  - Proper processing of dengue virus nonstructural glycoprotein NS1 requires the N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence and the downstream nonstructural protein NS2a
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 63
SP  - 1852
EP  - 1860
AB  - Expression of dengue virus gene products involves specific proteolytic cleavages of a precursor polyprotein. To study the flanking sequences required for expression of the dengue virus nonstructural glycoprotein NS1, we constructed a series of recombinant vaccinia viruses that contain the coding sequence for NS1 in combination with various lengths of upstream and downstream sequences. The NS1 products expressed by these viruses in infected CV-1 cells were immune precipitated and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The data show that the 24-residue hydrophobic sequence preceding NS1 was necessary and sufficient for the production of glycosylated NS1 and that this sequence was cleaved from NS1 in the absence of most dengue virus proteins. This finding is consistent with previous proposals that this hydrophobic sequence serves as an N-terminal signal sequence that is cleaved by signal peptidase. The cleavage between the C terminus of NS1 and the downstream protein NS2a occurred when the complete NS2a was present. Recombinant viruses containing NS1 plus 15 or 49% of NS2a produced proteins larger than authentic NS1, indicating that the cleavage between NS1 and NS2a had not occurred. Failure of cleavage was not corrected by coinfection with a recombinant virus capable of cleavage. These results suggest that NS2a may be a cis-acting protease that cleaves itself from NS1, or NS2a may provide sequences for recognition by a specific cellular protease that cleaves at the NS1-NS2a junction.

EP  - 281
AB  - Dengue virus affects hundreds of millions of people each year around the world, causing a tremendous social and economic impact on affected countries. The aim of this review is to summarize our current knowledge of the functions, structure, and interactions of the viral capsid protein. The primary role of capsid is to package the viral genome. There are two processes linked to this function: the recruitment of the viral RNA during assembly and the release of the genome during infection. Although particle assembly takes place on endoplasmic reticulum membranes, capsid localizes in nucleoli and lipid droplets. Why capsid accumulates in these locations during infection remains unknown. In this review, we describe available data and discuss new ideas on dengue virus capsid functions and interactions. We believe that a deeper understanding of how the capsid protein works during infection will create opportunities for novel antiviral strategies, which are urgently needed to control dengue virus infections.

JF  - Molecular & Cellular Proteomics
VL  - 16
SP  - S75
EP  - S91
AB  - Protein–protein interactions govern biological functions in cells, in the extracellular milieu, and at the border between cells and extracellular space. Viruses are small intracellular parasites and thus rely on protein interactions to produce progeny inside host cells and to spread from cell to cell. Usage of host proteins by viruses can have severe consequences e.g. apoptosis, metabolic disequilibria, or altered cell proliferation and mobility. Understanding protein interactions during virus infection can thus educate us on viral infection and pathogenesis mechanisms. Moreover, it has led to important clinical translations, including the development of new therapeutic and vaccination strategies. Here, we will discuss protein interactions of members of the Flaviviridae family, which are small enveloped RNA viruses. Dengue virus, Zika virus and hepatitis C virus belong to the most prominent human pathogenic Flaviviridae. With a genome of roughly ten kilobases encoding only ten viral proteins, Flaviviridae display intricate mechanisms to engage the host cell machinery for their purpose. In this review, we will highlight how dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus proteins engage host proteins and how this knowledge helps elucidate Flaviviridae infection. We will specifically address the protein composition of the virus particle as well as the protein interactions during virus entry, replication, particle assembly, and release from the host cell. Finally, we will give a perspective on future challenges in Flaviviridae interaction proteomics and why we believe these challenges should be met.

TI  - Protein Kinase G Phosphorylates Mosquito-Borne Flavivirus NS5
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83
SP  - 9195
EP  - 9205
AB  - ABSTRACT Serine/threonine phosphorylation of the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is a conserved feature of flaviviruses, but the kinase(s) responsible and function(s) remain unknown. Mass spectrometry was used to compare the phosphorylation sites of the NS5 proteins of yellow fever virus (YFV) and dengue virus (DENV), two flaviviruses transmitted by mosquitoes. Seven DENV phosphopeptides were identified, but only one conserved phosphoacceptor site (threonine 449 in DENV) was identified in both viruses. This site is predicted to be a protein kinase G (PKG) recognition site and is a strictly conserved serine/threonine phosphoacceptor site in mosquito-borne flaviviruses. In contrast, in tick-borne flaviviruses, this residue is typically a histidine. A DENV replicon engineered to have the tick-specific histidine residue at this position is replication defective. We show that DENV NS5 purified from Escherichia coli is a substrate for PKG in vitro and facilitates the autophosphorylation of PKG as seen with cellular substrates. Phosphorylation in vitro by PKG also occurs at threonine 449. Activators and inhibitors of PKG modulate DENV replication in cell culture but not replication of the tick-borne langat virus. Collectively, these data argue that PKG mediates a conserved serine/threonine phosphorylation event specifically for flaviviruses spread by mosquitoes.

TI  - Protein Kinase Regulated by dsRNA Downregulates the Interferon Production in Dengue Virus- and dsRNA-Stimulated Human Lung Epithelial Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 8
AB  - Background Dengue virus (DENV) is found in the tropical and subtropical regions and affects millions of people annually. Currently, no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against dengue virus is available. Innate immunity has been shown to be important for host resistance to DENV infection. Although protein kinase regulated by double-stranded RNA (PKR) has been found to promote the innate signaling in response to infection by several viruses, its role in the innate response to DENV infection is still unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the role of PKR in DENV-induced innate immune responses. Methodology/Principal Findings By RNAi, silencing of PKR significantly enhanced the expression of interferon (IFN)-β in DENV infected human lung epithelial A549 cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy data showed that PKR knockdown upregulated the activation of innate signaling cascades including p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), interferon regulatory factor-3 and NF-κB, following DENV2 infection. Likewise, a negative regulatory effect of PKR on the IFN production was also observed in poly(IC) challenged cells. Moreover, the PKR knockdown-mediated IFN induction was attenuated by RIG-I or IPS-1 silencing. Finally, overexpression of a catalytically inactive PKR mutant (K296R), but not of a mutant lacking dsRNA binding activity (K64E) or the double mutant (K64EK296R), reversed the IFN induction mediated by PKR knockdown, suggesting that the dsRNA binding activity is required for PKR to downregulate IFN production. Conclusions/Significance PKR acts as a negative regulator of IFN induction triggered by DENVs and poly(IC), and this regulation relies on its dsRNA binding activity. These findings reveal a novel regulatory role for PKR in innate immunity, suggesting that PKR might be a promising target for anti-DENV treatments.

TI  - Protein-protein interactions between A. aegypti midgut and dengue virus 2: two-hybrid screens using the midgut cDNA library.
JF  - Journal of infection in developing countries
VL  - 9 12

AB  - INTRODUCTION
Dengue virus (DENV) is principally transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. To date, mosquito population control remains the key strategy for reducing the continuing spread of DENV. The focus on the development of new vector control strategies through an understanding of the mosquito-virus relationship is essential, especially targeting the midgut, which is the first mosquito organ exposed to DENV infection.


METHODOLOGY
A cDNA library derived from female adult A. aegypti mosquito midgut cells was established using the switching mechanism at the 5' end of the RNA transcript (SMART), in combination with a highly potent recombination machinery of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays were performed against DENV-2 proteins (E, prM, M, and NS1). Mammalian two-hybrid (M2H) and double immunofluorescence assays (IFA) were conducted to validate the authenticity of the three selected interactions.


RESULTS
The cDNA library was of good quality based on its transformation efficiency, cell density, titer, and the percentage of insert size. A total of 36 midgut proteins interacting with DENV-2 proteins were identified, some involved in nucleic acid transcription, oxidoreductase activity, peptidase activity, and ion binding. Positive outcomes were obtained from the three selected interactions validated using M2H and double IFA assays.


CONCLUSIONS
The identified proteins have different biological activities that may aid in the virus replication pathway. Therefore, the midgut cDNA library is a valuable tool for identifying DENV-2 interacting proteins. The positive outcomes of the three selected proteins validated supported the quality of the cDNA library and the robustness of the Y2H mechanisms.

AB  - Dengue virus is a flavivirus that causes Dengue Fever (DF), Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS), a serious public health problem in many countries. An auto-immune response is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of severe dengue and the increased level of Circulating Immune Complexes (CIC) in dengue infected patients. Therefore, a proteomic analysis of proteins in the CIC can provide a better knowledge of the pathogenesis and a potential biomarker for severe dengue. A proteomic strategy based immune complexome analysis was performed to analyze the composition of CIC from plasma of fifteen dengue infected patients and five healthy control children. A total of 111 proteins were identified in the CIC from all individuals, with 17 proteins shared by healthy, DF, DHF, and DSS groups. All detected proteins were of similar relative proportion in the CIC of healthy, DF, DHF, and DSS groups. The results also revealed a high similarity of CIC profiles between four groups of subjects when classifying identified proteins according to cellular components or functional protein categories. These results showed no evidence to support the roles of CIC mediated by auto-immune response in the pathogenesis of severe dengue.

AB  - BackgroundProteomic analysis was performed to identify proteins regulated during infection by Dengue serotypes 1 and 3 in an Aedes albopictus cell line. The potential of these viruses to cause severe disease at primary infection is of interest although few studies have been performed with these two Dengue serotypes.ResultsThe most relevant observation of our study is the significant overexpression of proteins involved in the cellular stress response and the glycolysis pathway after 48 hours of infection. Viral infection activates the translation of some host genes, which may result in stress due to responses involving unfolded proteins.ConclusionsTherefore, the oxidation reduction and glycolytic mechanisms could participate in the antiviral response against Dengue virus. The results of our study should help to improve our knowledge of the virus-mosquito interaction at a cellular level with the aim of designing efficient strategies for the control of Dengue virus.

AB  - Dengue virus infection remains a public health problem worldwide. However, its pathogenic mechanisms and pathophysiology are still poorly understood. We performed proteomic analysis to evaluate early host responses (as indicated by altered proteins) in human target cells during dengue virus infection. HepG2 cells were infected with dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN-2) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0. Quantitative analyses of DEN-2 infection and cell death at 12, 24, and 48 h postinfection showed that the MOI of 1.0 with 24 h postinfection duration was the optimal condition to evaluate early host responses, as this condition provided the high %Infection ( approximately 80%), while %Cell death ( approximately 20%) was comparable to that of the mock-control cells. Proteins derived from the mock-control and DEN-2-infected cells were resolved by 2-D PAGE ( n = 5 gels for each group) and visualized by SYPRO Ruby stain. Quantitative intensity analysis revealed 17 differentially expressed proteins, which were successfully identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. Most of these altered proteins were the key factors involved in transcription and translation processes. Further functional study on these altered proteins may lead to better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and host responses to dengue virus infection, and also to the identification of new therapeutic targets for dengue virus infection.

JF  - Expert review of proteomics
SP  - 1
EP  - 15
AB  - INTRODUCTION
Dengue virus (DENV) infection remains one of the most significant infectious diseases in humans. Several efforts have been made to address its molecular mechanisms. Over the last 10 years, proteomics has been widely applied to investigate various aspects of DENV infection.


AREAS COVERED
In this review, we briefly introduce common proteomics approaches using various mass spectrometric modalities followed by summarizing all the discoveries obtained from proteomic investigations of DENV infection over the last 10 years. These include the data on DENV-vector interactions and host responses to address the DENV biology and disease mechanisms. Moreover, applications of proteomics to disease prevention, diagnosis, vaccine design, development of anti-DENV agents and other new treatment strategies are discussed.


EXPERT OPINION
Despite efforts on disease prevention, DENV infection is still a significant global healthcare burden that affects the general population. As summarized herein, proteomic technologies with high-throughput capabilities have provided more in-depth details of protein dynamics during DENV infection. More extensive applications of proteomics and other powerful research tools would provide a promise to better cope and prevent this mosquito-borne infectious disease.

TI  - Proteomics analysis of peripheral blood monocytes from patients in early dengue infection reveals potential markers of subsequent fluid leakage
AB  - Infections caused by dengue virus (DENV) cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The majority of patients have a mild course of dengue fever (DF) disease, however a proportion of infected individuals develop much more severe dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) resulting in circulatory collapse and multiorgan failure due to increased vascular permeability. Early detection of individuals likely to develop severe disease could lead to improved outcomes for patients, and help use healthcare resources more efficiently. At present there are no reliable markers during the earlier stages of infection that indicate which patients will go on to develop DHF. Our study was aimed at identifying proteins that are differentially regulated early during disease in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) of patients who subsequently develop DHF. Such proteins may also point at cellular pathways implicated in developing vascular leakage. PBMC were isolated from patients with a confirmed dengue infection, lysed and subjected to tandem mass tag mass spectrometry. One hundred and sixty proteins were differentially expressed in DENV-infected samples compared to healthy controls. These were mainly involved in type I interferon signaling, cytokine response, phagocytosis, haemostasis and cell adhesion. PBMC from DHF patients differentially expressed 90 proteins compared to individuals with DF; these were involved in down-regulation of platelet activation and aggregation, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton arrangement pathways. Proteins involved in oxidative stress and p38 MAPK signaling were upregulated in DHF samples during early infection compared to DF samples. The proteins reported here that are differentially regulated in PBMC early during infection could potentially serve as biomarkers to identify patients at risk of developing DHF at an early disease stage. This study also provides important observations on pathways implicated in severe DENV infection.

AB  - Both dengue and West Nile virus infections are an increasing risk to humans, not only in tropical and subtropical areas, but also in North America and parts of Europe. These viral infections are generally transmitted by mosquitoes, but may also be tick-borne. Infection usually results in mild flu-like symptoms, but can also cause encephalitis and fatalities. Approximately 2799 severe West Nile virus cases were reported this year in the United States, resulting in 102 fatalities. With this alarming increase in the number of West Nile virus infections in western countries and the fact that dengue virus already affects millions of people per year in tropical and subtropical climates, there is a real need for effective medicines. A possible therapeutic target to combat these viruses is the protease, which is essential for virus replication. In order to provide structural information to help to guide a lead identification and optimization program, crystallizations of the NS2B-NS3 protease complexes from both dengue and West Nile viruses have been initiated. Crystals that diffract to high resolution, suitable for three-dimensional structure determinations, have been obtained.

TI  - Purified NS2B/NS3 Serine Protease of Dengue Virus Type 2 Exhibits Cofactor NS2B Dependence for Cleavage of Substrates with Dibasic Amino Acids in Vitro*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 275
SP  - 9963
EP  - 9969
AB  - Dengue virus type 2 NS3, a multifunctional protein, has a serine protease domain (NS3pro) that requires the conserved hydrophilic domain of NS2B for protease activity in cleavage of the polyprotein precursor at sites following two basic amino acids. In this study, we report the expression of the NS2B-NS3pro precursor inEscherichia coli as a fusion protein with a histidine tag at the N terminus. The precursor was purified from insoluble inclusion bodies by Ni2+ affinity and gel filtration chromatography under denaturing conditions. The denatured precursor was refolded to yield a purified active protease complex. Biochemical analysis of the protease revealed that its activity toward either a natural substrate, NS4B-NS5 precursor, or the fluorogenic peptide substrates containing two basic residues at P1 and P2, was dependent on the presence of the NS2B domain. The peptide with a highly conserved Gly residue at P3 position was 3-fold more active as a substrate than a Gln residue at this position. The cleavage of a chromogenic substrate with a single Arg residue at P1 was NS2B-independent. These results suggest that heterodimerization of the NS3pro domain with NS2B generates additional specific interactions with the P2 and P3 residues of the substrates.

AB  - Dengue viruses are arthropod-borne, single-stranded RNA viruses. Aëdes aegypti and Aëdes albopictus are the principal vectors. In order to understand the molecular basis of dengue virus infections we explored the biochemical identity of dengue-2 (DEN-2) virus receptors in the Aëdes albopictus-derived cell line C6/36. We show here that DEN-2 interacts with two major polypeptides of 80 and 67 kDa. Polyclonal anti-C6/36 membrane antibodies block DEN-2 binding to intact C6/36 monolayers as well as to membrane extracts. Our results strongly suggest that the identified polypeptides are part of the DEN-2 receptors.

EP  - e130
AB  - Chemical modification of transcripts with 5’ caps occurs in all organisms. Here we report a systems-level mass spectrometry-based technique, CapQuant, for quantitative analysis of the cap epitranscriptome in any organism. The method was piloted with 21 canonical caps – m7GpppN, m7GpppNm, GpppN, GpppNm, and m2,2,7GpppG – and 5 “metabolite” caps – NAD, FAD, UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcNAc, and dpCoA. Applying CapQuant to RNA from purified dengue virus, Escherichia coli, yeast, mice, and humans, we discovered four new cap structures in humans and mice (FAD, UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcNAc, and m7Gpppm6A), cell- and tissue-specific variations in cap methylation, and surprisingly high proportions of caps lacking 2’-O-methylation, such as m7Gpppm6A in mammals and m7GpppA in dengue virus, and we did not detect cap m1A/m1Am in humans. CapQuant accurately captured the preference for purine nucleotides at eukaryotic transcription start sites and the correlation between metabolite levels and metabolite caps. The mystery around cap m1A/m1Am analysis remains unresolved.

TI  - Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Host-virus Interactions Reveals a Role for Golgi Brefeldin A Resistance Factor 1 (GBF1) in Dengue Infection*
JF  - Molecular & Cellular Proteomics
VL  - 13
SP  - 2836
EP  - 2854
AB  - Dengue virus is considered to be the most important mosquito-borne virus worldwide and poses formidable economic and health care burdens on many tropical and subtropical countries. Dengue infection induces drastic rearrangement of host endoplasmic reticulum membranes into complex membranous structures housing replication complexes; the contribution(s) of host proteins and pathways to this process is poorly understood but is likely to be mediated by protein-protein interactions. We have developed an approach for obtaining high confidence protein-protein interaction data by employing affinity tags and quantitative proteomics, in the context of viral infection, followed by robust statistical analysis. Using this approach, we identified high confidence interactors of NS5, the viral polymerase, and NS3, the helicase/protease. Quantitative proteomics allowed us to exclude a large number of presumably nonspecific interactors from our data sets and imparted a high level of confidence to our resulting data sets. We identified 53 host proteins reproducibly associated with NS5 and 41 with NS3, with 13 of these candidates present in both data sets. The host factors identified have diverse functions, including retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum transport, biosynthesis of long-chain fatty-acyl-coenzyme As, and in the unfolded protein response. We selected GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor responsible for ARF activation, from the NS5 data set for follow up and functional validation. We show that GBF1 plays a critical role early in dengue infection that is independent of its role in the maintenance of Golgi structure. Importantly, the approach described here can be applied to virtually any organism/system as a tool for better understanding its molecular interactions.

TI  - Quantitative Trait Loci That Control Dengue-2 Virus Dissemination in the Mosquito Aedes aegypti
JF  - Genetics
VL  - 170
SP  - 185
EP  - 194
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the most important vector of yellow fever and dengue fever flaviviruses. Ae. aegypti eradication campaigns have not been sustainable and there are no effective vaccines for dengue viruses. Alternative control strategies may depend upon identification of mosquito genes that condition flavivirus susceptibility and may ultimately provide clues for interrupting transmission. Quantitative trait loci affecting the ability of Ae. aegypti to develop a dengue-2 infection in the midgut have been mapped previously. Herein we report on QTL that determine whether mosquitoes with a dengue-2-infected gut can then disseminate the virus to other tissues. A strain selected for high rates of dengue-2 dissemination was crossed to a strain selected for low dissemination rates. QTL were mapped in the F2 and again in an F5 advanced intercross line. QTL were detected at 31 cM on chromosome I, at 32 cM on chromosome II, and between 44 and 52 cM on chromosome III. Alleles at these QTL were additive or dominant in determining rates of dengue-2 dissemination and accounted for ∼45% of the phenotypic variance. The locations of dengue-2 midgut infection and dissemination QTL correspond to those found in earlier studies.

AB  - Dengue virus-2 (DENV-2) RNA was quantified from the midgut and legs of individual Aedes aegypti at each of 14 days postinfectious blood meal (dpi) in a DENV-2 susceptible strain from Chetumal, Mexico. A SYBR Green I based strand-specific, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed. The lower detection and quantitation limits were 20 and 200 copies per reaction, respectively. Amounts of positive and negative strand viral RNA strands were correlated. Numbers of plaque-forming units (PFU) were correlated with DENV-2 RNA copy number in both C6/36 cell cultures and mosquitoes. PFU were consistently lower than RNA copy number by 2-3 log(10). Midgut levels of DENV-2 RNA peaked 8 dpi and fluctuated erratically between 6 and 9 dpi. Copies of DENV-2 RNA varied significantly among infected mosquitoes at each time point. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR is a convenient and reliable method that provides new insights into virus-vector interactions.

AB  - Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) RNA replication profiles and tropisms were studied by using quantitative RT-PCR (q-RTPCR) in intrathoracically infected Aedes albopictus. The virus RNA replication profiles were diverse in mosquito organs. In fat body, brain, salivary gland, and malpighian tubes, it peaked at 8, 23, 23, and 27 days post-infection, respectively, and then, all declined. In midgut, it increased all the time and had no trend of decline. In ovary, it had no apparent increase. Subsequent Western blotting of DENV-2 E protein had similar results. Using ribosomal protein 7 (rpS7) as an internal control, we found that, in salivary gland, brain, fat body, and midgut, the average DENV-2 RNA levels (DENV-2 RNA/rpS7 mRNA) were 1,028, 464, 5.6, and 6.2, respectively; in malpighian tubes, it was 1, and in ovary, it was far less than 1. These results suggest that infection profiles and tropism of DENV-2 RNA in Ae. albopictus organs are significantly different.

TI  - Quantitative mass spectrometry of DENV-2 RNA-interacting proteins reveals that the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX6 binds the DB1 and DB2 3’ UTR structures
JF  - RNA Biology
VL  - 8
SP  - 1173
EP  - 1186
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a rapidly re-emerging flavivirus that causes dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), diseases for which there are no available therapies or vaccines. The DENV-2 positive-strand RNA genome contains 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) that have been shown to form secondary structures required for virus replication and interaction with host cell proteins. In order to comprehensively identify host cell factors that bind the DENV-2 UTRs, we performed RNA chromatography, using the DENV-2 5’ and 3’ UTRs as “bait”, combined with quantitative mass spectrometry. We identified several proteins, including DDX6, G3BP1, G3BP2, Caprin1, and USP10, implicated in P body (PB) and stress granule (SG) function, and not previously known to bind DENV RNAs. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy showed these proteins to colocalize with the DENV replication complex. Moreover, DDX6 knockdown resulted in reduced amounts of infectious particles and viral RNA in tissue culture supernatants following DENV infection. DDX6 interacted with DENV RNA in vivo during infection and in vitro this interaction was mediated by the DB1 and DB2 structures in the 3’ UTR, possibly by formation of a pseudoknot structure. Additional experiments demonstrate that, in contrast to DDX6, the SG proteins G3BP1, G3BP2, Caprin1 and USP10 bind to the variable region (VR) in the 3’ UTR. These results suggest that the DENV-2 3’ UTR is a site for assembly of PB and SG proteins and, for DDX6, assembly on the 3’ UTR is required for DENV replication.

JF  - Insect Molecular Biology
VL  - 13
AB  - Quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting the ability of the Aedes aegypti midgut to become infected with Dengue 2 virus (DEN2) were mapped in the F5 generation of an advanced intercross line (AIL). A strain of Ae. aegypti previously selected for DEN2 susceptibility was crossed to a new strain selected for refractoriness to midgut infection. In P1 and F1 parents and 147 F5 offspring, genotypes at forty‐four cDNA loci were analysed. A new sex linked QTL and a second QTL on chromosome II with genotypes subject to balancing selection were detected that condition midgut susceptibility. Alleles at these QTL contributed additively in determining susceptibility and accounted for ∼24% of the phenotypic variance. Markers associated with a midgut escape barrier were inconsistently supported.

TI  - RACK1 Associates with RNA-Binding Proteins Vigilin and SERBP1 to Facilitate Dengue Virus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - We recently identified the scaffolding RACK1 protein as an important host-dependency factor for dengue virus (DENV), a positive-stranded RNA virus responsible for the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease worldwide. Here, we have performed the first RACK1 interactome in human cells and identified Vigilin and SERBP1 as DENV host-dependency factors. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for dengue disease, a major human health concern for which no effective treatment is available. DENV relies heavily on the host cellular machinery for productive infection. Here, we show that the scaffold protein RACK1, which is part of the DENV replication complex, mediates infection by binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit. Mass spectrometry analysis of RACK1 partners coupled to an RNA interference screen-identified Vigilin and SERBP1 as DENV host-dependency factors. Both are RNA-binding proteins that interact with the DENV genome. Genetic ablation of Vigilin or SERBP1 rendered cells poorly susceptible to DENV, as well as related flaviviruses, by hampering the translation and replication steps. Finally, we established that a Vigilin or SERBP1 mutant lacking RACK1 binding but still interacting with the viral RNA is unable to mediate DENV infection. We propose that RACK1 recruits Vigilin and SERBP1, linking the DENV genome to the translation machinery for efficient infection. IMPORTANCE We recently identified the scaffolding RACK1 protein as an important host-dependency factor for dengue virus (DENV), a positive-stranded RNA virus responsible for the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease worldwide. Here, we have performed the first RACK1 interactome in human cells and identified Vigilin and SERBP1 as DENV host-dependency factors. Both are RNA-binding proteins that interact with the DENV RNA to regulate viral replication. Importantly, Vigilin and SERBP1 interact with RACK1 and the DENV viral RNA (vRNA) to mediate viral replication. Overall, our results suggest that RACK1 acts as a binding platform at the surface of the 40S ribosomal subunit to recruit Vigilin and SERBP1, which may therefore function as linkers between the viral RNA and the translation machinery to facilitate infection.

TI  - RETREG1 (FAM134B): A new player in human diseases: 15 years after the discovery in cancer
JF  - Journal of Cellular Physiology
VL  - 233
SP  - 4479
EP  - 4489
AB  - FAM134B (family with sequence similarity 134, member B)/RETREG1 and its functional roles are relatively new in human diseases. This review aimed to summarize various functions of FAM134B since our first discovery of the gene in 2001. The protein encoded by FAM134B is a reticulophagy receptor that regulates turnover of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by selective phagocytosis. Absence or non‐functional expression of FAM134B protein impairs ER‐turnover and thereby is involved in the pathogenesis of some human diseases. FAM134B inhibition contributes to impair proteostasis in the ER due to the accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins, which in turn leads to compromised neuronal survival and progressive neuronal degenerative diseases. Mutations in FAM134B associated with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IIB (HSAN IIB). Selective cleavage of FAM134B by Dengue, Zika, and West Nile virus encoded protease NS2B3 leads to the increased production of infection units, whereas upregulation of FAM134B inhibits viral replication. In cancer, FAM134B acts as a tumor suppressor and inhibit cancer growth both in‐vitro and in‐vivo. Pharmacological upregulation of FAM134B resulted in reduced cancer cell growth and proliferation. In addition, FAM134B mutations are common in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma, and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. These mutations and expression changes of FAM134B were associated with the biological aggressiveness of these cancers. FAM134B also plays a role in allergic rhinitis, vascular dementia, and identification of stem cells. Taken together, information available in the literature suggests that FAM134B plays critical roles in human diseases, by interacting with different biological and chemical mediators, which are primarily regulated by ER turnover.

TI  - RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3 Synergistically Play an Important Role in Restriction of Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 5
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) infection is one of the most common mosquito-borne viral diseases in the world. The innate immune system is important for the early detection of virus and for mounting a cascade of defense measures which include the production of type 1 interferon (IFN). Hence, a thorough understanding of the innate immune response during DV infection would be essential for our understanding of the DV pathogenesis. A recent application of the microarray to dengue virus type 1 (DV1) infected lung carcinoma cells revealed the increased expression of both extracellular and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors; retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation associated gene-5 (MDA-5) and Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3). These intracellular RNA sensors were previously reported to sense DV infection in different cells. In this study, we show that they are collectively involved in initiating an effective IFN production against DV. Cells silenced for these genes were highly susceptible to DV infection. RIG-I and MDA5 knockdown HUH-7 cells and TLR3 knockout macrophages were highly susceptible to DV infection. When cells were silenced for only RIG-I and MDA5 (but not TLR3), substantial production of IFN-β was observed upon virus infection and vice versa. High susceptibility to virus infection led to ER-stress induced apoptosis in HUH-7 cells. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that the intracellular RNA virus sensors (RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3) are activated upon DV infection and are essential for host defense against the virus.

TI  - RIG-I–like Receptor Triggering by Dengue Virus Drives Dendritic Cell Immune Activation and TH1 Differentiation
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 198
SP  - 4764
EP  - 4771
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes 400 million infections annually and is one of several viruses that can cause viral hemorrhagic fever, which is characterized by uncontrolled immune activation resulting in high fever and internal bleeding. Although the underlying mechanisms are unknown, massive cytokine secretion is thought to be involved. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the main target cells of DENV, and we investigated their role in DENV-induced cytokine production and adaptive immune responses. DENV infection induced DC maturation and secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF. Inhibition of DENV RNA replication abrogated these responses. Notably, silencing of RNA sensors RIG-I or MDA5 abrogated DC maturation, as well as cytokine responses by DENV-infected DCs. DC maturation was induced by type I IFN responses because inhibition of IFN-α/β receptor signaling abrogated DENV-induced DC maturation. Moreover, DENV infection of DCs resulted in CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4 expression, which was abrogated after RIG-I and MDA5 silencing. DCs play an essential role in TH cell differentiation, and we show that RIG-I and MDA5 triggering by DENV leads to TH1 polarization, which is characterized by high levels of IFN-γ. Notably, cytokines IL-6, TNF, and IFN-γ and chemokines CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4 have been associated with disease severity, endothelial dysfunction, and vasodilation. Therefore, we identified RIG-I and MDA5 as critical players in innate and adaptive immune responses against DENV, and targeting these receptors has the potential to decrease hemorrhagic fever in patients.

TI  - RNA Association, RNA Interference, and microRNA Pathways in Dengue Fever Virus-Host Interaction
JF  - Current Topics in Tropical Emerging Diseases and Travel Medicine
AB  - Dengue fever is a fatal vector transmitted disease and is one of the most significant health problems which have magnified its impact globally by afflicting 390 million people across 110 countries. The causative agent of this life-threatening disease is a posi- tive single-stranded RNA arbovirus known as dengue virus (DENV), which uses Aedes aegypti mosquito as an intermediate host. It has been well demonstrated that virus evades mosquito’s RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated antiviral defense and manipulates host microRNA (miRNA) profile to its own benefit. However, the exact mechanisms are still not exclusively elucidated. The molecular mechanisms which characterize the role of novel DENV-encoded small RNAs and other viral proteins in host miRNA modulation and evasion of RNA interference are still elusive. Furthermore, the possibility of small activating RNAs-(RNAa)-mediated activation in mosquitoes in conjunction with dengue virus genes is not fully explored. This book chapter pragmatically overviews intricate interplay between virus-host interactions, how virus invades host antivirus defense mechanisms, and possibly the potential emerging therapeutic role of RNA activation (RNAa) and RNAi for the infections, which can be cured by specific gene activation and gene silencing, respectively. microRNA as anti-mRNA-based treatment strategies with strong evidences are evolutionary, still a successful and reliable treatment line in viral infections with certain issues of drug delivery and long-term therapeutic effects. The involvement of lincRNAs and variations in miRNA epigenetic profile in disease-specific arboviruses (e.g., dengue virus) during infection indicate complex genome interactions between virus and hosts. RNA association as a novel therapeutic approach to treat infection by gene activation, to find out some specific modulators of gene regulation in viral replication as well as in disease progression is still in an explanatory phase specifically for disease-specific or insect-specific flaviviruses. In conjunction, the molecular approaches to find out disease progression pathways in disease-specific arboviruses are still investigative and antiviral treatment approaches in the form of siRNAs, microRNAs as well as RNA association still need be explored fully before their practical implementations in diagnostics and as some antiviral therapeutics.

TI  - RNA Helicase A Is an Important Host Factor Involved in Dengue Virus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - Dengue, caused by dengue virus, is a rapidly spreading disease, and currently there are no treatments available. Host factors involved in the viral replication of dengue virus are potential antiviral therapeutic targets. Although RHA has been shown to promote the multiplication of several viruses, such as HIV and adenovirus, its role in the flavivirus family, including dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and emerging Zika virus, remains elusive. The current study revealed that RHA relocalized into the cytoplasm upon DENV infection and associated with viral RNA and nonstructural proteins, implying that RHA was actively engaged in the viral life cycle. We further provide evidence that RHA promoted the viral yields of DENV2 independent of its helicase activity. These findings demonstrated that RHA is a new host factor required for DENV replication and might serve as a target for antiviral drugs. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) utilizes host factors throughout its life cycle. In this study, we identified RNA helicase A (RHA), a member of the DEAD/H helicase family, as an important host factor of DENV. In response to DENV2 infection, nuclear RHA protein was partially redistributed into the cytoplasm. The short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of RHA significantly reduced the amounts of infectious viral particles in various cells. The RHA knockdown reduced the multistep viral growth of DENV2 and Japanese encephalitis virus but not Zika virus. Further study showed that the absence of RHA resulted in a reduction of both viral RNA and protein levels, and the data obtained from the reporter replicon assay indicated that RHA does not directly promote viral protein synthesis. RHA bound to the DENV RNA and associated with three nonstructural proteins, including NS1, NS2B3, and NS4B. Further study showed that different domains of RHA mediated its interaction with these viral proteins. The expression of RHA or RHA-K417R mutant protein lacking ATPase/helicase activity in RHA-knockdown cells successfully restored DENV2 replication levels, suggesting that the helicase activity of RHA is dispensable for its proviral effect. Overall, our work reveals that RHA is an important factor of DENV and might serve as a target for antiviral agents. IMPORTANCE Dengue, caused by dengue virus, is a rapidly spreading disease, and currently there are no treatments available.

TI  - RNA Interference Mediated Inhibition of Dengue Virus Multiplication and Entry in HepG2 Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Background Dengue virus-host cell interaction initiates when the virus binds to the attachment receptors followed by endocytic internalization of the virus particle. Successful entry into the cell is necessary for infection initiation. Currently, there is no protective vaccine or antiviral treatment for dengue infection. Targeting the viral entry pathway has become an attractive therapeutic strategy to block infection. This study aimed to investigate the effect of silencing the GRP78 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis on dengue virus entry and multiplication into HepG2 cells. Methodology/Principal Findings HepG2 cells were transfected using specific siRNAs to silence the cellular surface receptor (GRP78) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. Gene expression analysis showed a marked down-regulation of the targeted genes (87.2%, 90.3%, and 87.8% for GRP78, CLTC, and DNM2 respectively) in transfected HepG2 cells when measured by RT-qPCR. Intracellular and extracellular viral RNA loads were quantified by RT-qPCR to investigate the effect of silencing the attachment receptor and clathrin-mediated endocytosis on dengue virus entry. Silenced cells showed a significant reduction of intracellular (92.4%) and extracellular viral RNA load (71.4%) compared to non-silenced cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed a marked reduction of infected cells (89.7%) in silenced HepG2 cells compared to non-silenced cells. Furthermore, the ability to generate infectious virions using the plaque assay was reduced 1.07 log in silenced HepG2 cells. Conclusions/Significance Silencing the attachment receptor and clathrin-mediated endocytosis using siRNA could inhibit dengue virus entry and multiplication into HepG2 cells. This leads to reduction of infected cells as well as the viral load, which might function as a unique and promising therapeutic agent for attenuating dengue infection and prevent the development of dengue fever to the severe life-threatening DHF or DSS. Furthermore, a decrease of viremia in humans can result in the reduction of infected vectors and thus, halt of the transmission cycle.

TI  - RNA Secondary Structure in the Coding Region of Dengue Virus Type 2 Directs Translation Start Codon Selection and Is Required for Viral Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 2170
EP  - 2182
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus is a positive-strand RNA virus and a member of the genus Flavivirus, which includes West Nile, yellow fever, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Flavivirus genomes are translated as a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into 10 proteins, the first of which is the viral capsid (C) protein. Dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) and other mosquito-borne flaviviruses initiate translation of C from a start codon in a suboptimal context and have multiple in-frame AUGs downstream. Here, we show that an RNA hairpin structure in the capsid coding region (cHP) directs translation start site selection in human and mosquito cells. The ability of the cHP to direct initiation from the first start codon is proportional to its thermodynamic stability, is position dependent, and is sequence independent, consistent with a mechanism in which the scanning initiation complex stalls momentarily over the first AUG as it begins to unwind the cHP. The cHP of tick-borne flaviviruses is not maintained in a position to influence start codon selection, which suggests that this coding region cis element may serve another function in the flavivirus life cycle. Here, we demonstrate that the DENV2 cHP and both the first and second AUGs of C are necessary for efficient viral replication in human and mosquito cells. While numerous regulatory elements have been identified in the untranslated regions of RNA viral genomes, we show that the cHP is a coding-region RNA element that directs start codon selection and is required for viral replication.

AB  - Dengue virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase specifically binds to the viral genome by interacting with a promoter element known as stem-loop A (SLA). Although a great deal has been learned in recent years about the function of this promoter in dengue virus-infected cells, the molecular details that explain how the SLA interacts with the polymerase to promote viral RNA synthesis remain poorly understood. Using RNA binding and polymerase activity assays, we defined two elements of the SLA that are involved in polymerase interaction and RNA synthesis. Mutations at the top of the SLA resulted in RNAs that retained the ability to bind the polymerase but impaired promoter-dependent RNA synthesis. These results indicate that protein binding to the SLA is not sufficient to induce polymerase activity and that specific nucleotides of the SLA are necessary to render an active polymerase-promoter complex for RNA synthesis. We also report that protein binding to the viral RNA induces conformational changes downstream of the promoter element. Furthermore, we found that structured RNA elements at the 3′ end of the template repress dengue virus polymerase activity in the context of a fully active SLA promoter. Using assays to evaluate initiation of RNA synthesis at the viral 3′-UTR, we found that the RNA-RNA interaction mediated by 5′-3′-hybridization was able to release the silencing effect of the 3′-stem-loop structure. We propose that the long range RNA-RNA interactions in the viral genome play multiple roles during RNA synthesis. Together, we provide new molecular details about the promoter-dependent dengue virus RNA polymerase activity.

TI  - RNA Silencing of Dengue Virus Type 2 Replication in Transformed C6/36 Mosquito Cells Transcribing an Inverted-Repeat RNA Derived from the Virus Genome
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 76
SP  - 12925
EP  - 12933
AB  - ABSTRACT Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) initiates cellular posttranscriptional responses that are collectively called RNA silencing in a number of different organisms, including plants, nematodes, and fruit flies. In plants, RNA silencing has been associated with protection from virus infection. In this study, we demonstrate that dsRNA-mediated interference also can act as a viral defense mechanism in mosquito cells. C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) cells were stably transformed with a plasmid designed to transcribe an inverted-repeat RNA (irRNA) derived from the genome of dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2) capable of forming dsRNA. Clonal cell lines were selected with an antibiotic resistance marker and challenged with DEN-2. The cell lines were classified as either susceptible or resistant to virus replication, based on the percentage of cells expressing DEN-2 envelope (E) antigen 7 days after challenge. Eight out of 18 (44%) cell lines designed to express irRNA were resistant to DEN-2 challenge, with more than 95% of the cells showing no DEN-2 antigen accumulation. One of the DEN-2-resistant cell lines, FB 9.1, was further characterized. DEN-2 genome RNA failed to accumulate in FB 9.1 cells after challenge. Northern blot hybridization detected transcripts containing transgene sequences of both sense and antisense polarity, suggesting that DEN-2-specific dsRNA was present in the cells. In addition, a class of small RNAs 21 to 25 nucleotides in length was detected that specifically hybridized to labeled sense or antisense DEN-2 RNA derived from the target region of the genome. These observations were consistent with RNA silencing as the mechanism of resistance to DEN-2 in transformed mosquito cells.

TI  - RNA Structure Duplication in the Dengue Virus 3′ UTR: Redundancy or Host Specificity?
JF  - mBio
VL  - 10
AB  - Flaviviruses constitute the most relevant group of arthropod-transmitted viruses, including important human pathogens such as the dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The natural alternation of these viruses between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts shapes the viral genome population, which leads to selection of different viral variants with potential implications for epidemiological fitness and pathogenesis. However, the selective forces and mechanisms acting on the viral RNA during host adaptation are still largely unknown. Here, we found that two almost identical tandem RNA structures present at the viral 3′ untranslated region are under different selective pressures in the two hosts. Mechanistic studies indicated that the two RNA elements, known as dumbbells, contain sequences that overlap essential RNA cyclization elements involved in viral RNA synthesis. The data support a model in which the duplicated RNA structures differentially evolved to accommodate distinct functions for viral replication in the two hosts. ABSTRACT Flaviviruses include a diverse group of medically important viruses that cycle between mosquitoes and humans. During this natural process of switching hosts, each species imposes different selective forces on the viral population. Using dengue virus (DENV) as model, we found that paralogous RNA structures originating from duplications in the viral 3′ untranslated region (UTR) are under different selective pressures in the two hosts. These RNA structures, known as dumbbells (DB1 and DB2), were originally proposed to be enhancers of viral replication. Analysis of viruses obtained from infected mosquitoes showed selection of mutations that mapped in DB2. Recombinant viruses carrying the identified variations confirmed that these mutations greatly increase viral replication in mosquito cells, with low or no impact in human cells. Use of viruses lacking each of the DB structures revealed opposite viral phenotypes. While deletion of DB1 reduced viral replication about 10-fold, viruses lacking DB2 displayed a great increase of fitness in mosquitoes, confirming a functional diversification of these similar RNA elements. Mechanistic analysis indicated that DB1 and DB2 differentially modulate viral genome cyclization and RNA replication. We found that a pseudoknot formed within DB2 competes with long-range RNA-RNA interactions that are necessary for minus-strand RNA synthesis. Our results support a model in which a functional diversification of duplicated RNA elements in the viral 3′ UTR is driven by host-specific requirements. This study provides new ideas for understanding molecular aspects of the evolution of RNA viruses that naturally jump between different species.

TI  - RNA Viruses, Toll-Like Receptors, and Cytokines: The Perfect Storm?
JF  - Journal of Innate Immunity
VL  - 17
SP  - 126
EP  - 153
AB  - Abstract Background The interactions between viruses and the host immune response are nuanced and intricate. The cytokine response arguably plays a central role in dictating the outcome of virus infection, balancing inflammation, and healing, which is crucial to resolving infection without destructive immunopathologies. Summary Early innate immune responses are key to the generation of a beneficial or detrimental immune response. These initial responses are regulated by a plethora of surface bound, endosomal, and cytoplasmic innate immune receptors known as pattern recognition receptors. Of these, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the induction of cytokines during virus infection. Recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as viral proteins and/or nucleotide sequences, the TLRs act as sentinels for the initiation and propagation of immune responses. Key Messages TLRs are important receptors for initiating the innate response to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses like influenza A virus (IAV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, dengue virus, and Ebola virus. Infection with these viruses is also associated with aberrant expression of proinflammatory cytokines that contribute to a harmful cytokine storm response. Herein we discuss the connections between these ssRNA viruses, cytokine storm, and the roles of TLRs.

TI  - RNA interference modulates replication of dengue virus in Drosophila melanogaster cells
JF  - BMC Microbiology
VL  - 10
SP  - 127
EP  - 127
AB  - BackgroundMosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV, genus Flavivirus) has emerged as a major threat to global human health in recent decades, and novel strategies to contain the escalating dengue fever pandemic are urgently needed. RNA interference (RNAi) induced by exogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) has shown promise for treatment of flavivirus infections in hosts and prevention of transmission by vectors. However, the impact of RNAi triggered by authentic virus infection on replication of DENV, or any flavivirus, has received little study. The objectives of the current study were threefold: first, to assess the utility of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells for the study of DENV, second to investigate the impact of multiple enzymes in the RNAi pathway on DENV replication; and third to test for variation in the response of the four serotypes of DENV to modulation of RNAi.ResultsThree strains from each of the four DENV serotypes showed replication in S2 cells following infection at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.1 and MOI 10; each strain achieved titers > 4.0 log10pfu/ml five days after infection at MOI 10. The four serotypes did not differ in mean titer. S2 cells infected with DENV-1, 2, 3 or 4 produced siRNAs, indicating that infection triggered an RNAi response. Knockdown of one of the major enzymes in the RNAi pathway, Dicer-2 (Dcr-2), resulted in a 10 to 100-fold enhancement of replication of all twelve strains of DENV in S2 cells. While serotypes did not differ in their average response to Dcr-2 knockdown, strains within serotypes showed significant differences in their sensitivity to Dcr-2 knockdown. Moreover, knockdown of three additional components of the RNAi pathway, Argonaute 2 (Ago-2), Dcr-1 and Ago-1, also resulted in a significant increase in replication of the two DENV strains tested, and the magnitude of this increase was similar to that resulting from Dcr-2 knockdown.ConclusionsThese findings indicate that DENV can replicate in Drosophila S2 cells and that the RNAi pathway plays a role in modulating DENV replication in these cells. S2 cells offer a useful cell culture model for evaluation of the interaction between DENV and the RNAi response.

TI  - RNA structures that resist degradation by Xrn1 produce a pathogenic Dengue virus RNA
JF  - eLife
VL  - 3
AB  - Dengue virus is a growing global health threat. Dengue and other flaviviruses commandeer the host cell’s RNA degradation machinery to generate the small flaviviral RNA (sfRNA), a noncoding RNA that induces cytopathicity and pathogenesis. Host cell exonuclease Xrn1 likely loads on the 5′ end of viral genomic RNA and degrades processively through ∼10 kB of RNA, halting near the 3′ end of the viral RNA. The surviving RNA is the sfRNA. We interrogated the architecture of the complete Dengue 2 sfRNA, identifying five independently-folded RNA structures, two of which quantitatively confer Xrn1 resistance. We developed an assay for real-time monitoring of Xrn1 resistance that we used with mutagenesis and RNA folding experiments to show that Xrn1-resistant RNAs adopt a specific fold organized around a three-way junction. Disrupting the junction’s fold eliminates the buildup of disease-related sfRNAs in human cells infected with a flavivirus, directly linking RNA structure to sfRNA production.

TI  - RNAi screen reveals a role of SPHK2 in dengue virus–mediated apoptosis in hepatic cell lines
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 12
AB  - Hepatic dysfunction is a feature of dengue virus (DENV) infection. Hepatic biopsy specimens obtained from fatal cases of DENV infection show apoptosis, which relates to the pathogenesis of DENV infection. However, how DENV induced liver injury is not fully understood. In this study, we aim to identify the factors that influence cell death by employing an apoptosis-related siRNA library screening. Our results show the effect of 558 gene silencing on caspase 3-mediated apoptosis in DENV-infected Huh7 cells. The majority of genes that contributed to apoptosis were the apoptosis-related kinase enzymes. Tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 12 (TNFSF12), and sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2), were selected as the candidate genes to further validate their influences on DENV-induced apoptosis. Transfection of siRNA targeting SPHK2 but not TNFSF12 genes reduced apoptosis determined by Annexin V/PI staining. Knockdown of SPHK2 did not reduce caspase 8 activity; however, did significantly reduce caspase 9 activity, suggesting its involvement of SPHK2 in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Treatment of ABC294649, an inhibitor of SPHK2, reduced the caspase 3 activity, suggesting the involvement of its kinase activity in apoptosis. Knockdown of SPHK2 significantly reduced caspase 3 activity not only in DENV-infected Huh7 cells but also in DENV-infected HepG2 cells. Our results were consistent across all of the four serotypes of DENV infection, which supports the pro-apoptotic role of SPHK2 in DENV-infected liver cells.

TI  - RNase L-induced bodies sequester subgenomic flavivirus RNAs and re-establish host RNA decay
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) are structured RNA elements encoded in the 3’-UTR of flaviviruses that promote viral infection by inhibiting cellular RNA decay machinery. Herein, we analyze the production of sfRNAs using single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA-FISH) and super-resolution microscopy during West Nile virus, Zika virus, or Dengue virus serotype 2 infection. We show that sfRNAs are initially localized diffusely in the cytosol or in processing bodies (P-bodies). However, upon activation of the host antiviral endoribonuclease, Ribonuclease L (RNase L), nearly all sfRNAs re-localize to antiviral biological condensates known as RNase L-induced bodies (RLBs). RLB-mediated sequestration of sfRNAs reduces sfRNA association with RNA decay machinery in P-bodies, which coincides with increased viral RNA decay. These findings establish a role of RLBs in promoting viral RNA decay, demonstrating the complex host-pathogen interactions at the level of RNA decay and biological condensation. Highlights Single-molecule imaging of sfRNA production and localization sfRNAs localize to RNase L-induced bodies RNase L-induced bodies sequester sfRNAs away from P-bodies Sequestration of sfRNAs by RNase L-induced bodies enhances decay of viral genomes

TI  - ROCK is Involved in Vimentin Phosphorylation and Rearrangement Induced by Dengue Virus
JF  - Cell Biochemistry and Biophysics
VL  - 67
SP  - 1333
EP  - 1342
AB  - Our previous study showed that dengue virus 2 (DENV2) infection induces rearrangement of vimentin into dense structures at the perinuclear area. However, the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is poorly characterized. In the present work, we found that vimentin and Ser71 phosphorylated vimentin display similar distributions in DENV2-infected cells. DENV2 infection also induced ROCK activation and phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser71 as the DENV2 infection progressed. Furthermore, Ser71 phosphorylation and vimentin rearrangement induced by DENV2 infection were blocked by the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. In addition, DENV2 led to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) redistribution in the perinuclear region of the host cells, which was partially blocked by pretreatment with Y-27632. Together, these data support indicate that ROCK may have a role in governing regulating vimentin and ER rearrangement during DENV2 infection. We hypothesize that DENV2 infection, via ROCK activation, induces both vimentin rearrangement and ER redistribution around the perinuclear region, which may play a structural role in anchoring DENV2 to replication sites.

TI  - RPLP1 and RPLP2 Are Essential Flavivirus Host Factors That Promote Early Viral Protein Accumulation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT The Flavivirus genus contains several arthropod-borne viruses that pose global health threats, including dengue viruses (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). In order to understand how these viruses replicate in human cells, we previously conducted genome-scale RNA interference screens to identify candidate host factors. In these screens, we identified ribosomal proteins RPLP1 and RPLP2 (RPLP1/2) to be among the most crucial putative host factors required for DENV and YFV infection. RPLP1/2 are phosphoproteins that bind the ribosome through interaction with another ribosomal protein, RPLP0, to form a structure termed the ribosomal stalk. RPLP1/2 were validated as essential host factors for DENV, YFV, and ZIKV infection in two human cell lines: A549 lung adenocarcinoma and HuH-7 hepatoma cells, and for productive DENV infection of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Depletion of RPLP1/2 caused moderate cell-line-specific effects on global protein synthesis, as determined by metabolic labeling. In A549 cells, global translation was increased, while in HuH-7 cells it was reduced, albeit both of these effects were modest. In contrast, RPLP1/2 knockdown strongly reduced early DENV protein accumulation, suggesting a requirement for RPLP1/2 in viral translation. Furthermore, knockdown of RPLP1/2 reduced levels of DENV structural proteins expressed from an exogenous transgene. We postulate that these ribosomal proteins are required for efficient translation elongation through the viral open reading frame. In summary, this work identifies RPLP1/2 as critical flaviviral host factors required for translation. IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses cause important diseases in humans. Examples of mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses include dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses. Viruses require a plethora of cellular factors to infect cells, and the ribosome plays an essential role in all viral infections. The ribosome is a complex macromolecular machine composed of RNA and proteins and it is responsible for protein synthesis. We identified two specific ribosomal proteins that are strictly required for flavivirus infection of human cells and mosquitoes: RPLP1 and RPLP2 (RPLP1/2). These proteins are part of a structure known as the ribosomal stalk and help orchestrate the elongation phase of translation. We show that flaviviruses are particularly dependent on the function of RPLP1/2. Our findings suggest that ribosome composition is an important factor for virus translation and may represent a regulatory layer for translation of specific cellular mRNAs.

JF  - Journal of Virology

EP  - 4885
AB  - ABSTRACT The mechanisms of cellular entry of dengue and West Nile viruses are not well characterized. We show that both these viruses enter HeLa cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis and require vacuolar acidic pH. Inhibition of the GTPase Rab 5 or 7, which regulates transport to early or late endosomes, respectively, demonstrated that Rab 5 was essential for survival of both dengue and West Nile virus. These data broaden our understanding of the pathways required for productive dengue and West Nile virus infection and may facilitate new strategies for combating disease.

TI  - Rab18 Facilitates Dengue Virus Infection by Targeting Fatty Acid Synthase to Sites of Viral Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 6793
EP  - 6804
AB  - ABSTRACT Positive-sense RNA viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), hijack the intracellular membrane machinery for their own replication. The Rab18 protein, a member of the Rab GTPase family, key regulators of membrane trafficking, is located on the organelles involved in DENV infection, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LDs). In this study, we addressed the potential involvement of Rab18 in DENV infection by using cells overexpressing the wild-type, GTP-bound active form, or GDP-bound inactive form of Rab18 and cells with Rab18 knockdown. DENV replication, measured by viral protein, viral RNA, and viral progeny production, as well as LD induction, was reduced in cells with inactive Rab18 and in cells deprived of Rab18 expression, suggesting a positive role of Rab18 in the DENV life cycle. Interestingly, the interaction of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key lipogenic enzyme in lipid biosynthesis, with DENV NS3 protein relied on the conversion of the GDP-bound to the GTP-bound form of Rab18. Furthermore, the targeting of FASN to sites participating in DENV infection, such as the ER and LDs, depends on functional Rab18. Thus, Rab18-mediated membrane trafficking of FASN and NS3 facilitates DENV replication, probably by ensuring a sufficient and coordinated lipid supply for membrane proliferation and arrangement. IMPORTANCE Infection by dengue virus (DENV), an important mosquito-borne virus threatening ∼40% of the world's population, can cause mild dengue fever or severe dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The pathogenesis mechanisms of DENV-related diseases are not clear, but high viral replication is believed to be a risk factor for the severe form of DENV infection. Thus, understanding the detailed mechanism of DENV replication might help address this devastating virus. Here, we found that Rab18, a small GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking and located in the endoplasmic reticulum network and on the surfaces of lipid droplets, positively regulates DENV replication. The functional machinery of Rab18 is required to recruit the enzyme fatty acid synthase to sites of DENV replication and to interact with DENV NS3 protein to promote fatty acid biosynthesis. Thus, DENV usurps Rab18 to facilitate its own replication.

TI  - Rab8, a Vesicular Traffic Regulator, Is Involved in Dengue Virus Infection in HepG2 Cells
JF  - Intervirology
VL  - 51
SP  - 182
EP  - 188
AB  - Objective: The pathogenesis of dengue virus (DV) has not been completely clarified. Rab8 regulates vesicular traffic from Golgi to plasma membrane where DV is matured and then delivered by exocytosis. In this study, involvement of Rab8 in DV serotype 2 (DV2) infection was investigated in HpeG2 cells. Methods: Distributions of Rab8 and DV2, and the number of infection cells were observed by immunostaining. HepG2Rab8AM and HepG2Rab8DN cells were constructed to stably express a constitutively active mutant of Rab8 and a dominant negative mutant, respectively, which were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of infectious virions and the amounts of DV2 entry were detected by standard plaque assay. Viral RNA replication was detected by real-time RT-PCR. Results: Rab8 showed high co-localization with DV2 in HpeG2 cells and the amount of DV antigen-positive cells decreased in HepG2Rab8AM and HepG2Rab8DN cells. Also, progeny virus released from those cells was drastically reduced. Infectious virions produced in cells were also significantly reduced, while the viral RNA replication was down-regulated by a different level. Furthermore, viral entry into those cells was reduced by about 80%. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the function of Rab8 is important for DV2 infection, and Rab8 may be involved in DV2 infection.

TI  - Rapid and Massive Virus-Specific Plasmablast Responses during Acute Dengue Virus Infection in Humans
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 2911
EP  - 2918
AB  - ABSTRACT Humoral immune responses are thought to play a major role in dengue virus-induced immunopathology; however, little is known about the plasmablasts producing these antibodies during an ongoing infection. Herein we present an analysis of plasmablast responses in patients with acute dengue virus infection. We found very potent plasmablast responses that often increased more than 1,000-fold over the baseline levels in healthy volunteers. In many patients, these responses made up as much 30% of the peripheral lymphocyte population. These responses were largely dengue virus specific and almost entirely made up of IgG-secreting cells, and plasmablasts reached very high numbers at a time after fever onset that generally coincided with the window where the most serious dengue virus-induced pathology is observed. The presence of these large, rapid, and virus-specific plasmablast responses raises the question as to whether these cells might have a role in dengue immunopathology during the ongoing infection. These findings clearly illustrate the need for a detailed understanding of the repertoire and specificity of the antibodies that these plasmablasts produce.

TI  - Recent Insights Into the Molecular Mechanism of Toll-Like Receptor Response to Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease caused by dengue virus (DENV). Recently, DENV has been affecting humans within an expanding geographic range due to the warming of the earth. Innate immune responses play a significant role in antiviral defense, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key regulators of innate immunity. Therefore, a detailed understanding of TLR and DENV interactions is important for devising therapeutic and preventive strategies. Several studies have indicated the ability of DENV to modulate the TLR signaling pathway and host immune response. Vaccination is considered one of the most successful medical interventions for preventing viral infections. However, only a partially protective dengue vaccine, the first licensed dengue vaccine CYD-TDV, is available in some dengue-endemic countries to protect against DENV infection. Therefore, the development of a fully protective, durable, and safe DENV vaccine is a priority for global health. Here, we demonstrate the progress made in our understanding of the host response to DENV infection, with a particular focus on TLR response and how DENV avoids the response toward establishing infection. We also discuss dengue vaccine candidates in late-stage development and the issues that must be overcome to enable their success.

AB  - This is a selective review of recent publications on dengue clinical features, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and vaccine development placed in a context of observations made over the past half century. Four dengue viruses (DENVs) are transmitted by urban cycle mosquitoes causing diseases whose nature and severity are influenced by interacting factors such as virus, age, immune status of the host, and human genetic variability. A phenomenon that controls the kinetics of DENV infection, antibody-dependent enhancement, best explains the correlation of the vascular permeability syndrome with second heterotypic DENV infections and infection in the presence of passively acquired antibodies. Based on growing evidence in vivo and in vitro, the tissue-damaging DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is responsible for most of the pathophysiological features of severe dengue. This review considers the contribution of hemophagocytic histiocytosis syndrome to cases of severe dengue, the role of movement of humans in dengue epidemiology, and modeling and planning control programs and describes a country-wide survey for dengue infections in Bangladesh and efforts to learn what controls the clinical outcome of dengue infections. Progress and problems with three tetravalent live-attenuated vaccines are reviewed. Several research mysteries remain: why is the risk of severe disease during second heterotypic DENV infection so low, why is the onset of vascular permeability correlated with defervescence, and what are the crucial components of protective immunity?

AB  - Dengue is an emerging threat to billions of people worldwide. In the last 20 years, the incidence has increased four-fold and this trend appears to be continuing. Caused by one of four viral serotypes, dengue can present as a wide range of clinical phenotypes with the severe end of the spectrum being defined by a syndrome of capillary leak, coagulopathy, and organ impairment. The pathogenesis of severe disease is thought to be in part immune mediated, but the exact mechanisms remain to be defined. The current treatment of dengue relies on supportive measures with no licensed therapeutics available to date. There have been recent advances in our understanding of a number of areas of dengue research, of which the following will be discussed in this review: the drivers behind the global dengue pandemic, viral structure and epitope binding, risk factors for severe disease and its pathogenesis, as well as the findings of recent clinical trials including therapeutics and vaccines. We conclude with current and future dengue control measures and key areas for future research.

AB  - Based on the hypothesis that interactions between virions and serum components may influence the outcome of dengue virus (DENV) infections, we decided to use affinity chromatography with domain III from the envelope (E) protein of DENV2 (DIIIE2) as a ligand to isolate virus-binding proteins from human plasma. This approach yielded serum amyloid P (SAP) and α2-macroglobulin (α2M) as novel viral interactors. After confirming the specific binding of both SAP and α2M to DIIIE2 by ELISA, the latter interaction was examined in greater detail. We obtain evidence suggesting that the binding species was actually the receptor-activated form of α2M (α2M*), that α2M* could bind monovalently to recombinant domain III from all four DENV serotypes with affinities in the micromolar range ranking as DENV4>DENV1~DENV2>DENV3 and that this interaction exhibited a strong avidity effect when multivalent binding was favoured (KD 8 × 10(-8) M for DIIIE2). We also showed that α2M* bound to DENV virions of the four serotypes, protecting the virus from temperature-induced inactivation in the absence of serum and enhancing infectivity. The latter effect exhibited an ED50 of 2.9 × 10(-8) M, also suggesting an avidity effect due to multivalent binding. These results will further contribute to the characterization of the virus-host factor interaction network during human DENV infection.

AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease, caused by dengue virus, a member of the Flaviviridae family. Its worldwide incidence is now a major health problem, with 2.5 billion people living in risk areas. In this review, we integrate the structural rearrangements of each viral protein and their functions in all the steps of virus entry into the host cells. We describe in detail the putative receptors and attachment factors in mammalian and mosquito cells, and the recognition of viral immunocomplexes via Fcγ receptor in immune cells. We also discuss that virus internalization might occur through distinct entry pathways, including clathrin-mediated or non-classical clathrin-independent endocytosis, depending on the host cell and virus serotype or strain. The implications of viral maturation in virus entry are also explored. Finally, we discuss the mechanisms of viral genome access to the cytoplasm. This includes the role of low pH-induced conformational changes in the envelope protein that mediate membrane fusion, and original insights raised by our recent work that supports the hypothesis that capsid protein would also be an active player in this process, acting on viral genome translocation into the cytoplasm.

AB  - The complete nonstructural NS5 gene of dengue type 1 virus, Singapore strain S275/90 (D1-S275/90) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein (126 kDa). The GST-NS5 fusion protein was purified and the recombinant NS5 protein released from the fusion protein by thrombin cleavage. The recombinant NS5 had a predicted molecular weight of 100 kDa and reacted with antiserum against D1-S275/90 virus in Western blot analysis. The purified recombinant NS5 protein possessed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity which was inhibited (>99%) by antibodies against the recombinant NS5 protein. The polymerase product was shown to be a negative-stranded RNA molecule, of template size, which forms a double-stranded complex with the template RNA.

AB  - The full-length dengue virus NS3 protein has been successfully expressed as a 94-kDa GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli. Treatment of the purified fusion protein with thrombin released a 68-kDa protein which is the expected molecular mass for the DEN1 NS3 protein. The identity of this protein was confirmed by Western blotting using dengue virus antisera. Two related activities of the recombinant NS3 protein were characterized, which were the binding of the protein to the 3'-noncoding region of the dengue virus RNA genome and NTPase activity. We demonstrated using a band shift assay that the DEN1 NS3 protein could form a complex with the stem-loop structure in the 3'-noncoding region (3'-NCR), although sites outside the stem-loop may also participate in binding. Using various unlabeled homopolymeric and heteropolymeric RNAs as competitors for binding, it was further shown that the DEN1 NS3 protein exhibits preferential binding to a 94-nt RNA transcript from the 3'-NCR of the dengue virus. The NTPase activity of the recombinant DEN1 NS3 protein was characterized using a thin-layer chromatography assay. We found that the DEN1 NS3 protein possesses some aspects of NTPase activity, which are distinct from those found in other flaviviruses. Although the NS3 protein was able to utilize all four ribonucleoside triphosphates as its substrates, the NS3 protein showed a distinct preference for purine triphosphates (i.e., ATP and GTP). The addition of poly(U) did not stimulate NTPase activity in DEN1 NS3 protein, which contrasts with the reports for other flaviviral NS3 proteins. However, NTPase activity was specifically stimulated by the viral NS5 protein, which was manifested by a more than twofold increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis and a 25% increase in the yield of ADP at the end of a 120-min reaction. These data suggest that the NTPase activity of the NS3 protein may be regulated by the viral NS5 protein during virus replication.

VL  - 94 Pt 11
SP  - 2437
EP  - 48
AB  - Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) is a lipid kinase with important roles including regulation of cell survival. We have previously shown reduced SphK1 activity in cells with an established dengue virus type-2 (DENV-2) infection. In this study, we examined the effect of alterations in SphK1 activity on DENV-2 replication and cell death and determined the mechanisms of the reduction in SphK1 activity. Chemical inhibition or overexpression of SphK1 after established DENV-2 infection had no effect on infectious DENV-2 production, although inhibition of SphK1 resulted in enhanced DENV-2-induced cell death. Reduced SphK1 activity was observed in multiple cell types, regardless of the ability of DENV-2 infection to be cytopathic, and was mediated by a post-translational mechanism. Unlike bovine viral diarrhea virus, where SphK1 activity is decreased by the NS3 protein, SphK1 activity was not affected by DENV-2 NS3 but, instead, was reduced by expression of the terminal 396 bases of the 3' UTR of DENV-2 RNA. We have previously shown that eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) is a direct activator of SphK1 and here DENV-2 RNA co-localized and co-precipitated with eEF1A from infected cells. We propose that the reduction in SphK1 activity late in DENV-2-infected cells is a consequence of DENV-2 out-competing SphK1 for eEF1A binding and hijacking cellular eEF1A for its own replication strategy, rather than a specific host or virus-induced change in SphK1 to modulate viral replication. Nonetheless, reduced SphK1 activity may have important consequences for survival or death of the infected cell.

SP  - 95
EP  - 109
AB  - Sphingosine kinase (SK) 1 is a host kinase that enhances some viral infections. Here we investigated the ability of SK1 to modulate dengue virus (DENV) infection in vitro. Overexpression of SK1 did not alter DENV infection; however, targeting SK1 through chemical inhibition resulted in reduced DENV RNA and infectious virus release. DENV infection of SK1⁻/ ⁻ murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resulted in inhibition of infection in an immortalized line (iMEF) but enhanced infection in primary MEFs (1°MEFs). Global cellular gene expression profiles showed expected innate immune mRNA changes in DENV-infected WT but no induction of these responses in SK1⁻/⁻  iMEFs. Reverse transciption PCR demonstrated a low-level induction of IFN-β and poor induction of mRNA for the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) viperin, IFIT1 and CXCL10 in DENV-infected SK1⁻/⁻  compared with WT iMEFs. Similarly, reduced induction of ISGs was observed in SK1⁻/⁻  1°MEFs, even in the face of high-level DENV replication. In both iMEFs and 1°MEFs, DENV infection induced production of IFN-β protein. Additionally, higher basal levels of antiviral factors (IRF7, CXCL10 and OAS1) were observed in uninfected SK1⁻/⁻  iMEFs but not 1°MEFs. This suggests that, in this single iMEF line, lack of SK1 upregulates the basal levels of factors that may protect cells against DENV infection. More importantly, regardless of the levels of DENV replication, all cells that lacked SK1 produced IFN-β but were refractory to induction of ISGs such as viperin, IFIT1 and CXCL10. Based on these findings, we propose new roles for SK1 in affecting innate responses that regulate susceptibility to DENV infection.

AB  - Diurnal temperature fluctuations can fundamentally alter mosquito biology and mosquito-virus interactions in ways that impact pathogen transmission. We investigated the effect of two daily fluctuating temperature profiles on Aedes aegypti vector competence for dengue virus (DENV) serotype-1. A large diurnal temperature range of 18.6°C around a 26°C mean, corresponding with the low DENV transmission season in northwestern Thailand, reduced midgut infection rates and tended to extend the virus extrinsic incubation period. Dissemination was first observed at day 7 under small fluctuations (7.6°C; corresponding with high DENV transmission) and constant control temperature, but not until Day 11 for the large diurnal temperature range. Results indicate that female Ae. aegypti in northwest Thailand are less likely to transmit DENV during the low than high transmission season because of reduced DENV susceptibility and extended virus extrinsic incubation period. Better understanding of DENV transmission dynamics will come with improved knowledge of temperature effects on mosquito-virus interactions.

AB  - Methylation of flavivirus RNA is vital for its stability and translation in the infected host cell. This methylation is mediated by the flavivirus methyltransferase (MTase), which methylates the N7 and 2′‐O positions of the viral RNA cap by using S‐adenosyl‐l‐methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor. In this report, we demonstrate that SAM, in contrast to the reaction by‐product S‐adenosyl‐l‐homocysteine, which was assumed previously, is copurified with the Dengue (DNV) and West Nile virus MTases produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli). This endogenous SAM can be removed by denaturation and refolding of the MTase protein. The refolded MTase of DNV serotype 3 (DNV3) displays methylation activity comparable to native enzyme, and its crystal structure at 2.1 Å is almost identical to that of native MTase. We characterized the binding of Sinefungin (SIN), a previously described SAM‐analog inhibitor of MTase function, to the native and refolded DNV3 MTase by isothermal titration calorimetry, and found that SIN binds to refolded MTase with more than 16 times the affinity of SIN binding to the MTase purified natively. Moreover, we show that SAM is also copurified with other flavivirus MTases, indicating that purification by refolding may be a generally applicable tool for studying flavivirus MTase inhibition.

AB  - The focus of this review is to discuss findings in the last 10 years that have advanced our understanding of human NK cell responses to dengue virus. We will review recently identified interactions of activating and inhibitory receptors on NK cells with dengue virus, human NK responses to natural dengue infection and highlight possible interactions by which NK cells may shape adaptive immune responses. T cell responses to natural dengue infection will be reviewed by Laura Rivino in Chap. 10.1007/978-981-10-8727-1_17. With the advent of numerous dengue vaccine clinical trials, we will also review T and NK cell immune responses to dengue virus vaccination. As our understanding of the diverse functions of NK cell has advanced, it has become increasingly clear that human NK cell responses to viral infections are more complicated than initially recognized.

TI  - Regulation of Apoptosis during Flavivirus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 9
AB  - Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death that regulates cellular homeostasis by removing damaged or unnecessary cells. Its importance in host defenses is highlighted by the observation that many viruses evade, obstruct, or subvert apoptosis, thereby blunting the host immune response. Infection with Flaviviruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV) has been shown to activate several signaling pathways such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress and AKT/PI3K pathway, resulting in activation or suppression of apoptosis in virus-infected cells. On the other hands, expression of some viral proteins induces or protects apoptosis. There is a discrepancy between induction and suppression of apoptosis during flavivirus infection because the experimental situation may be different, and strong links between apoptosis and other types of cell death such as necrosis may make it more difficult. In this paper, we review the effects of apoptosis on viral propagation and pathogenesis during infection with flaviviruses.

TI  - Regulation of Host Innate Immunity by Non-Coding RNAs During Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - An estimated 3.9 billion individuals in 128 nations (about 40% of global population) are at risk of acquiring dengue virus infection. About 390 million cases of dengue are reported each year with higher prevalence in the developing world. A recent modeling-based report suggested that half of the population across the globe is at risk of dengue virus infection. In any given dengue outbreak, a percentage of infected population develops severe clinical manifestations, and this remains one of the “unsolved conundrums in dengue pathogenesis”. Although, host immunity and virus serotypes are known to modulate the infection, there are still certain underlying factors that play important roles in modulating dengue pathogenesis. Advanced genomics-based technologies have led to identification of regulatory roles of non-coding RNAs. Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that viruses and their hosts employ non-coding RNAs to modulate the outcome of infection in their own favor. The foremost ones seem to be the cellular microRNAs (miRNAs). Being the post-transcriptional regulators, miRNAs can be regarded as direct switches capable of turning “on” or “off” the viral replication process. Recently, role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in modulating viral infections via interferon dependent or independent signaling has been recognized. Hence, we attempt to identify the “under-dog”, the non-coding RNA regulators of dengue virus infection. Such essential knowledge will enhance the understanding of dengue virus infection in holistic manner, by exposing the specific molecular targets for development of novel prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic strategies.

TI  - Regulation of Inflammatory Chemokine Receptors on Blood T Cells Associated to the Circulating Versus Liver Chemokines in Dengue Fever
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Little is known about the role of chemokines/chemokines receptors on T cells in natural DENV infection. Patients from DENV-2 and -3- outbreaks were studied prospectively during the acute or convalescent phases. Expression of chemokine receptor and activation markers on lymphocyte subpopulations were determined by flow cytometry analysis, plasma chemokine ligands concentrations were measured by ELISA and quantification of CCL5/RANTES+ cells in liver tissues from fatal dengue cases was performed by immunochemistry. In the acute DENV-infection, T-helper/T-cytotoxic type-1 cell (Th1/Tc1)-related CCR5 is significantly higher expressed on both CD4 and CD8 T cells. The Th1-related CXCR3 is up-regulated among CD4 T cells and Tc2-related CCR4 is up-regulated among CD8 T cells. In the convalescent phase, all chemokine receptor or chemokine ligand expression tends to reestablish control healthy levels. Increased CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL4/MIP-1β but decreased CCL5/RANTES levels were observed in DENV-patients during acute infection. Moreover, we showed an increased CD107a expression on CCR5 or CXCR3-expressing T cells and higher expression of CD29, CD44HIGH and CD127LOW markers on CCR4-expressing CD8 T cells in DENV-patients when compared to controls. Finally, liver from dengue fatal patients showed increased number of cells expressing CCL5/RANTES in three out of four cases compared to three death from a non-dengue patient. In conclusion, both Th1-related CCR5 and CXCR3 among CD4 T cells have a potential ability to exert cytotoxicity function. Moreover, Tc1-related CCR5 and Tc2-related CCR4 among CD8 T cells have a potential ability to exert effector function and migration based on cell markers evaluated. The CCR5 expression would be promoting an enhanced T cell recruitment into liver, a hypothesis that is corroborated by the CCL5/RANTES increase detected in hepatic tissue from dengue fatal cases. The balance between protective and pathogenic immune response mediated by chemokines during dengue fever will be discussed.

TI  - Regulation of Innate Immunity by the Flaviviridae
JF  - 
VL  - 
SP  - 317
EP  - 333
AB  - This chapter provides an overview of Flaviviridae and their regulation of host-cell innate immune defenses. The viruses that comprise the Flaviviridae family are small enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. The Flaviviridae are divided into three genera of more closely related viruses: Flavivirus, Pestivirus, and Hepacivirus. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is now the most common cause of liver failure and liver transplantation in the United States and Europe. The ability to sense an invading pathogen is critical to the cell’s ability to respond in an appropriate manner to clear the infection. The cell utilizes a group of proteins known as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect the presence of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) within products of viral replication. It is likely that RIG-I primarily detects motifs within the genomes of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DV), and West Nile virus (WNV), as it does with HCV, since Flavivirus genomes are capped and therefore do not present naked 5' ppp motifs as PAMPs. Examination of interferon (IFN) signaling in infected cells has revealed strategies by which Flaviviridae members attenuate IFN-a/β receptor signaling actions, thus limiting the downstream expression of ISGs that otherwise control virus replication and spread. The Flaviviridae represent major pathogens of public health, agriculture, and environmental importance. Molecular studies have revealed common and unique mechanisms by which members of the different Flaviviridae genera evade host innate immunity and IFN actions that would otherwise limit infection.

TI  - Regulation of autophagy, glucose uptake, and glycolysis under dengue virus infection
JF  - The Kaohsiung Journal of Medical Sciences
VL  - 36
SP  - 911
EP  - 919
AB  - We previously reported that dengue virus (DENV)‐induced autophagy plays a promoting role in viral replication and pathogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Although it is known that DENV infection increases glycolysis, which promotes viral replication, the role of glucose metabolism together with autophagic activity in DENV replication remains unclear. In this study, we reveal that DENV2 infection increased autophagic activity, glucose uptake, protein levels of glucose transporter‐1 (GLUT1), and glycolysis rate‐limiting enzyme hexokinase‐2 (HK2) in cells. Furthermore, the protein levels of LC3‐II and HK2 were increased in the brain tissues of the DENV2‐infected suckling mice. However, DENV2 infection decreased ATP level and showed no effect on mRNA expression of HK2 and phosphofructokinase, as well as lactate production, indicating that DENV2‐regulated glycolytic flux occurs at the post‐transcriptional level and is lactate pathway‐independent. Moreover, amiodarone‐induced autophagic activity, glucose uptake, HK2 level, and viral titer were reversed by the autophagy inhibitor spautin‐1 or silencing of Atg5 gene expression. Intriguingly, blocking of glycolysis, HK2 protein level, and viral titer were accordingly decreased, but autophagic activity was increased, suggesting the existence of another regulation mechanism that influences the relationship between glycolysis and autophagy. This is the first report to reveal that DENV2‐induced autophagy positively regulates glycolysis and viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Our findings open a new avenue wherein metabolic modulation could be used as a target for the treatment of DENV infection.

JF  - World journal of biological chemistry
VL  - 5 2
SP  - 93
EP  - 105
AB  - Flaviviruses, ss(+) RNA viruses, include many of mankind's most important pathogens. Their pathogenicity derives from their ability to infect many types of cells including neurons, to replicate, and eventually to kill the cells. Flaviviruses can activate tumor necrosis factor α and both intrinsic (Bax-mediated) and extrinsic pathways to apoptosis. Thus they can use many approaches for activating these pathways. Infection can lead to necrosis if viral load is extremely high or to other types of cell death if routes to apoptosis are blocked. Dengue and Japanese Encephalitis Virus can also activate autophagy. In this case the autophagy temporarily spares the infected cell, allowing a longer period of reproduction for the virus, and the autophagy further protects the cell against other stresses such as those caused by reactive oxygen species. Several of the viral proteins have been shown to induce apoptosis or autophagy on their own, independent of the presence of other viral proteins. Given the versatility of these viruses to adapt to and manipulate the metabolism, and thus to control the survival of, the infected cells, we need to understand much better how the specific viral proteins affect the pathways to apoptosis and autophagy. Only in this manner will we be able to minimize the pathology that they cause.

TI  - Regulation of flavivirus RNA synthesis and capping
JF  - Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA
VL  - 4
AB  - RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses, are able to efficiently replicate and cap their RNA genomes in vertebrate and invertebrate cells. Flaviviruses use several specialized proteins to first make an uncapped negative strand copy of the viral genome that is used as a template for the synthesis of large numbers of capped genomic RNAs. Despite using relatively simple mechanisms to replicate their RNA genomes, there are significant gaps in our understanding of how flaviviruses switch between negative and positive strand RNA synthesis and how RNA capping is regulated. Recent work has begun to provide a conceptual framework for flavivirus RNA replication and capping and shown some surprising roles for genomic RNA during replication and pathogenesis.

EP  - 179
AB  - Autophagy is not only an intracellular recycling degradation system that maintains cellular homeostasis but is also a component of innate immunity that contributes to host defense against viral infection. The viral components as well as viral particles trapped in autophagosomes can be delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Abundant evidence indicates that dengue virus (DENV) has evolved the potent ability to hijack or subvert autophagy process for escaping host immunity and promoting viral replication. Moreover, autophagy is often required to deliver viral components to pattern recognition receptors signaling for interferon (IFN)‐mediated viral elimination. Hence, this review summarizes DENV‐induced autophagy, which exhibits dual effects on proviral activity of promoting replication and antiviral activity to eliminating viral particles.

TI  - Regulation of midgut cell proliferation impacts Aedes aegypti susceptibility to dengue virus
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 12
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the vector of some of the most important vector-borne diseases like Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika and Yellow fever, affecting millions of people worldwide. The cellular processes that follow a blood meal in the mosquito midgut are directly associated with pathogen transmission. We studied the homeostatic response of the midgut against oxidative stress, as well as bacterial and dengue virus (DENV) infections, focusing on the proliferative ability of the intestinal stem cells (ISC). Inhibition of the peritrophic matrix (PM) formation led to an increase in ROS production by the epithelial cells in response to contact with the resident microbiota, suggesting that maintenance of low levels of ROS in the intestinal lumen is key to keep ISCs division in balance. We show that dengue virus infection induces midgut cell division in both DENV susceptible (Rockefeller) and refractory (Orlando) mosquito strains. However, the susceptible strain delays the activation of the regeneration process compared with the refractory strain. Impairment of the Delta/Notch signaling, by silencing the Notch ligand Delta using RNAi, significantly increased the susceptibility of the refractory strains to DENV infection of the midgut. We propose that this cell replenishment is essential to control viral infection in the mosquito. Our study demonstrates that the intestinal epithelium of the blood fed mosquito is able to respond and defend against different challenges, including virus infection. In addition, we provide unprecedented evidence that the activation of a cellular regenerative program in the midgut is important for the determination of the mosquito vectorial competence.

TI  - Regulatory Role of Host MicroRNAs in Flaviviruses Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA that affect mRNA abundance or translation efficiency by binding to the 3′UTR of the mRNA of the target gene, thereby participating in multiple biological processes, including viral infection. Flavivirus genus consists of small, positive-stranded, single-stranded RNA viruses transmitted by arthropods, especially mosquitoes and ticks. The genus contains several globally significant human/animal pathogens, such as Dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Yellow fever virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Tembusu virus. After flavivirus invades, the expression of host miRNA changes, exerting the immune escape mechanism to create an environment conducive to its survival, and the altered miRNA in turn affects the life cycle of the virus. Accumulated evidence suggests that host miRNAs influence flavivirus replication and host–virus interactions through direct binding of viral genomes or through virus-mediated host transcriptome changes. Furthermore, miRNA can also interweave with other non-coding RNAs, such as long non-coding RNA and circular RNA, to form an interaction network to regulate viral replication. A variety of non-coding RNAs produced by the virus itself exert similar function by interacting with cellular RNA and viral RNA. Understanding the interaction sites between non-coding RNA, especially miRNA, and virus/host genes will help us to find targets for antiviral drugs and viral therapy.

TI  - Regulatory T‐cells in acute dengue viral infection
JF  - Immunology
VL  - 154
AB  - Although regulatory T‐cells (Tregs) have been shown to be expanded in acute dengue, their role in pathogenesis and their relationship to clinical disease severity and extent of viraemia have not been fully evaluated. The frequency of Tregs was assessed in 56 adult patients with acute dengue by determining the proportion of forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3) expressing CD4+ CD25+T‐cells (FoxP3+ cells). Dengue virus (DENV) viral loads were measured by quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DENV‐specific T‐cell responses were measured by ex‐vivo interferon (IFN)‐γ enzyme‐linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays to overlapping peptide pools of DENV‐NS3, NS1 and NS5. CD45RA and CCR4 were used to phenotype different subsets of T‐cells and their suppressive potential was assessed by their expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte‐antigen 4 (CTLA‐4) and Fas. While the frequency of FoxP3+ cells in patients was significantly higher (P < 0·0001) when compared to healthy individuals, they did not show any relationship with clinical disease severity or the degree of viraemia. The frequency of FoxP3+ cells did not correlate with either ex‐vivo IFN‐γ DENV‐NS3‐, NS5‐ or NS1‐specific T‐cell responses. FoxP3+ cells of patients with acute dengue were predominantly CD45RA+ FoxP3low, followed by CD45RA‐FoxP3low, with only a small proportion of FoxP3+ cells being of the highly suppressive effector Treg subtype. Expression of CCR4 was also low in the majority of T‐cells, with only CCR4 only being expressed at high levels in the effector Treg population. Therefore, although FoxP3+ cells are expanded in acute dengue, they predominantly consist of naive Tregs, with poor suppressive capacity.

JF  - Japanese journal of infectious diseases

SP  - 45
EP  - 50
AB  - Dengue virus infections are mostly asymptomatic but can produce a mild, self-limiting acute febrile illness, dengue fever, or a life threatening severe illness, dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is associated with increased vascular permeability partly as a result of elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). We characterized MMP-2 and MMP-9 production in mosquito and mammalian cells after infection with three strains of dengue virus type-2 (D2-) ranging in virulence: 16681, the prototype New Guinea C (NGC), and PDK-53 vaccine strain. These strains were used to test variations in viral properties in vaccine candidates and confirm the production of MMP as a possible marker for virulence. A zymogram gelatinolytic activity assay was used to assess MMP-2 and MMP-9 production. We found that dengue-infected mosquito and mammalian cell lines had unique MMP-2 and MMP-9 production patterns depending on the virulence of the infecting dengue strain and the duration infection. MMP levels were highest after infection with the most virulent strain D2-16681, followed by the prototype NGC strain, in both cell lines. The MMP levels appeared to correspond with the relative amounts of infectious virions produced later in infection. Our findings improve our understanding of dengue pathogenesis and may facilitate the selection of markers to further the development of dengue vaccines.

TI  - Release of reactive oxygen intermediates by dengue virus‐induced macrophage cytotoxin
JF  - International Journal of Experimental Pathology
VL  - 77
AB  - Dengue type 2 virus (DV) induces a subpopulation of T lymphocytes of mice to produce a cytokine, cytotoxic factor (mCF), which induces H‐2A positive macrophages to produce macrophage cytotoxin (CF2). The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism of cytotoxicity of CF2. It was observed that CF2 induced production of superoxide anion (O−2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the spleen cells of mice in vitro and in vivo. The maximum production of O−2 (260 ±10 nM/4 × 106 cells) was at 45 minutes while that of H2O2 was at 90 minutes after inoculation of CF2. Pretreatment of mice or spleen cells with anti‐CF2‐antisera inhibited O−2 and H2O2 production in a dose‐dependent manner. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibited O−2 production and cytotoxicity while H2O2 production was increased by increasing SOD concentration in the culture. This indicated that O−2 production is necessary for the cytotoxic activity of CF2. Pretreatment of the cells with Ca2+ channel blocking drugs, nifedipine or verapamil, inhibited CF2‐induced O−2 and H2O2 production in a dose‐dependent manner. We have shown earlier that the cytotoxic activity of CF2 is known to be Ca2+ dependent and CF2‐induced production of nitrite and the cytotoxicity is inhibited by NG‐monomethyl‐L‐arginine. Thus, it is suggested that O−2 and nitrite are necessary for cell killing by CF2 in a Ca2+ manner and the killing may possibly be by generation of peroxynitrite.

TI  - Replication in Cells of Hematopoietic Origin Is Necessary for Dengue Virus Dissemination
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen for which no vaccine or specific therapeutic is available. Although it is well established that dendritic cells and macrophages are primary sites of DENV replication, it remains unclear whether non-hematopoietic cellular compartments serve as virus reservoirs. Here, we exploited hematopoietic-specific microRNA-142 (miR-142) to control virus tropism by inserting tandem target sites into the virus to restrict replication exclusively in this cell population. In vivo use of this virus restricted infection of CD11b+, CD11c+, and CD45+ cells, resulting in a loss of virus spread, regardless of the route of administration. Furthermore, sequencing of the targeted virus population that persisted at low levels, demonstrated total excision of the inserted miR-142 target sites. The complete conversion of the virus population under these selective conditions suggests that these immune cells are the predominant sources of virus amplification. Taken together, this work highlights the importance of hematopoietic cells for DENV replication and showcases an invaluable tool for the study of virus pathogenesis.

TI  - Replication of Dengue Virus in K562-Megakaryocytes Induces Suppression in the Accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus can infect human megakaryocytes leading to decreased platelet biogenesis. In this article, we report a study of Dengue replication in human K562 cells undergoing PMA-induced differentiation into megakaryocytes. PMA-induced differentiation in these cells recapitulates steps of megakaryopoiesis including gene activation, expression of CD41/61 and CD61 platelet surface markers and accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our results show differentiating megakaryocyte cells to support higher viral replication without any apparent increase in virus entry. Further, Dengue replication suppresses the accumulation of ROS in differentiating cells, probably by only augmenting the activity of the transcription factor NFE2L2 without influencing the expression of the coding gene. Interestingly pharmacological modulation of NFE2L2 activity showed a simultaneous but opposite effect on intracellular ROS and virus replication suggesting the former to have an inhibitory effect on the later. Also cells that differentiated while supporting intracellular virus replication showed reduced level of surface markers compared to uninfected differentiated cells.

JF  - Infection and Immunity
VL  - 20

EP  - 781
AB  - The flavivirus dengue and the arenavirus Junin are both associated with a hemorrhagic shock syndrome in man. We have demonstrated the replication of these viruses in vitro in both rabbit and human endothelial cells by viral titers and immunofluorescent antibody studies. Rabbit endothelium established in continuous culture was derived from vena cava, while human cells in primary culture were derived from umbilical veins. In rabbit endothelium, dengue-2 virus passaged through monkey kidney monolayer cells (LLC-MK2) or human lymphoblastoid cells (raji) produced significantly more virus than the seed obtained from suckling mouse brain (MB). Inoculation of actively dividing, subconfluent human endothelial cells with the LLC-MK2 degue virus produced higher viral titers than inoculation of confluent cells. The appearance of Junin virus was delayed beyond that of dengue virus in rabbit endothelial cells although equivalent titers of virus were produced. In human cells, Junin virus was less productive than dengue virus and produced characteristic cycles of virus release. This is the first direct evidence for replication of human hemorrhagic fever viruses in endothelial cells.

EP  - 34
AB  - The severity of dengue virus infection ranges from mild fever to dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. The association of disease severity with virus replication in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) was examined for dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2) isolates from Asia or America. Additionally, we constructed DEN-2 recombinant viruses with substitutions at residue 390 in the envelope glycoprotein (E390) because this residue is linked with the region of virus origin. Comparisons of virus yields of 3 isolates failed to show a correlation with clinical disease. However, the American strain did not replicate as well as the 2 Asian strains. For the recombinant viruses, substitution of Asn (Asian) at E390 with Asp (American) resulted in decreased ability to replicate in MDMs. These results are consistent with the proposal that the lack of association of native American DEN-2 strains with severe disease is linked to reduced ability to replicate in MDMs, and that Asp at E390 may contribute to this reduction.

AB  - Dengue virus of types 1, 2, and 4 replicated reproducibly in cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes from 18 dengue-immune rhesus monkeys but failed to multiple in peripheral blood leukocytes from 25 nonimmune monkeys. Replication was observed at input multiplicity of infection of 0.1 and 0.01 but irregularly at less than or equal to 0.001. Dengue viruses in permissive leukocytes achieved maximal titers on days 2-4 of culture. Viral replication in peripheral blood leukocytes from animals immune to a different type of dengue virus and in animals immune to two or more types of dengue virus was quantitatively similar to that in peripheral blood leukocytes from homotypically immune donors. Dengue virus permissiveness developed between two and three weeks after primary dengue infections. Leukocytes of animals that developed immunity to dengue virus remained permissive to in vitro infection by dengue virus of types 1 and 2 for prolonged periods, but within six months permissiveness to type 4 decreased. Thus an immunological dependence of in vitro dengue virus replication in simian peripheral blood leukocytes was demonstrated.

AB  - Mosquito cell cultures infected with human sera from dengue-1 and dengue-2 outbreaks, started in Rio de Janerio by 1986 and 1990 respectively, were examined by electron microscopy at different times post the infection of cell cultures. More information was obtained about cell penetration of virus particles in the presence or not of antibodies, their pathway inside the cells, replication mode and exist. Infectiveness of the virus at those different stages can only be attributed to the particles appearing inside the trans-Golgi vesicles; most of all newly formed virus particles remain inside the RER-derived cell vesicles or inside lysosomes, even during cell lysis. Groups of larger particles, 65-75 nm in diameter at dengue-2 infections, persist during cell passage. The large amounts of smooth membrane structures, as vesicles or tubules inside the RER, are attributed to a cell response to viral infection.

AB  - Sequential electronmicroscopic studies of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes infected with dengue-2 virus showed replication of virus particles and vesicular structures confined to cells having an active, rough, endoplasmic reticulum. Small granules not found on the surface of virions produced in mammalian cells were seen on the envelopes of the virus particles. There was no evidence of nuclear involvement as described in infected mouse neurones, and there was no apparent impairment of cellular function. Substantial viral replication was confined to cells of the salivary glands and nervous tissue, with lesser involvement of midgut, hemocytes, epidermal cells, fatbody, and foregut.

AB  - We studied the susceptibility of four human lymphoblastoid cell lines (HCL) and of subpopulations of circulating peripheral human leukocytes to dengue-2 virus infection. HCL with B cell characteristics (Raji, Wil 2WT, 8866), B-type peripheral lymphocytes, and macrophages were productively infected by dengue-2 virus. In contrast, an HCL with T cell characteristics (MOLT-4), T type peripheral lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells did not become infected and replicate dengue-2 virus. PMN cells did not adsorb dengue-2 virus, suggesting lack of viral receptors. However, T-type cultured lymphoblasts and T-type peripheral lymphocytes adsorbed dengue-2 virus, suggesting that the block in viral replication involves some stage of infection occurring after adsorption. Permissiveness of B-type HCL to dengue-2 virus infection was dependent on the virus seed used but the virus titers obtained among the susceptible HCL varied. HCL infected persistently with dengue-2 virus have been established. Human peripheral lymphocytes inoculated after cultivation for 3 days in complete medium alone or complete medium supplemented with mitogens replicated dengue-2 virus. In contrast, unstimulated peripheral lymphocytes inoculated immediately after isolation adsorbed dengue-2 but did not support its replication. Mitogen-treated and untreated macrophages replicated dengue-2 virus equally well. The efficiency of dengue-2 virus replication by macrophages was higher than that of peripheral lymphocytes but lower than that of HCL.

AB  - Chimeric yellow fever virus 17D (YFV-17D) and dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) carrying the surface proteins of Modoc virus (MODV), a not-known-vector (NKV) flavivirus, replicated efficiently in mammalian (Vero-B) and mosquito (C6/36) cells, whereas MODV failed to replicate in mosquito cells. Transfection of C6/36 cells with MODV RNA did not result in virus replication; however, transfection of these mosquito cells with YFV-17D or DENV2 RNA did. The inability of NKV viruses (such as MODV) to infect and replicate in arthropod cells is thus not determined by the viral envelope, but by a post-entry event.

JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - : The Dengue Virus (DENV) does not have any treatment or effective vaccine that can be used to target the infection. Development of an effective treatment or vaccine is difficult due to Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of infection. As antibodies are responsible for recognition of an infection, we attempt to understand the mechanism by which antibody memory is created. Based on a hypothesis for the process by which antibody memory is developed, we identify a method by which the memory can be reset to be antigen non-specific, where the antibody’s Paratope is unable to recognize the DENV antigen and reacts by forming a new structure in the Paratope.

AB  - The dengue virus (DENV) envelope (E) protein mediates virus entry into cells via interaction with a range of cell-surface receptor molecules. Cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have been shown to play an early role in this interaction, and charged oligosaccharides such as heparin bind to the E protein. We have examined this interaction using site-directed mutagenesis of a recombinant form of the putative receptor-binding domain III of the DENV-2E protein expressed as an MBP (maltose-binding protein)-fusion protein. Using an ELISA-based GAG-binding assay, cell-based binding analysis and antiviral-activity assays, we have identified two critical residues, K291 and K295, that are involved in GAG interactions. These studies have also demonstrated differential binding between mosquito and human cells.

JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 184
SP  - 5705
EP  - 5714
AB  - CXCL10 is an IFN-inducible chemokine ligand that binds CXCR3, a receptor that is expressed on lymphocytes; CXCL10 shares the CXCR3 receptor with another two ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL11. Previously, we found that CXCL10−/− mice were more susceptible than wild-type (WT) mice to dengue virus (DENV) infection. In this study, we explored the mechanisms underlying this enhanced susceptibility. We found that viral loads were higher in the brains of CXCL10−/− mice than in WT mice. Presuming a defect in effector lymphocyte migration, we investigated whether recruitment of effector T cells and Ab-secreting cells to the infected tissues were impaired in CXCL10−/− mice. Unexpectedly, compared with WT, CXCL10−/− mice had comparable numbers of total infiltrating T cells, higher numbers of CXCR3+ T cells, and higher numbers of Ab-secreting cells in the brain. Additionally, we found that CXCL10 was induced in neurons following DENV infection and that CXCL10 competed with DENV for binding to cell surface heparan sulfate, a coreceptor for DENV entry, thus inhibiting binding of DENV to neuronal cells. These results demonstrate that the enhanced susceptibility of CXCL10−/− mice to DENV infection is not due to a defect in recruitment of effector lymphocytes but rather to an antiviral activity that promotes viral clearance.

TI  - Response of the mosquito immune system and symbiotic bacteria to pathogen infection
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 17
AB  - Mosquitoes are the deadliest animal in the word, transmitting a variety of insect-borne infectious diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, and Zika, causing more deaths than any other vector-borne pathogen. Moreover, in the absence of effective drugs and vaccines to prevent and treat insect-borne diseases, mosquito control is particularly important as the primary measure. In recent decades, due to the gradual increase in mosquito resistance, increasing attention has fallen on the mechanisms and effects associated with pathogen infection. This review provides an overview of mosquito innate immune mechanisms in terms of physical and physiological barriers, pattern recognition receptors, signalling pathways, and cellular and humoral immunity, as well as the antipathogenic effects of mosquito symbiotic bacteria. This review contributes to an in-depth understanding of the interaction process between mosquitoes and pathogens and provides a theoretical basis for biological defence strategies against mosquito-borne infectious diseases.

AB  - BackgroundTwo fifths of the world's population is at risk from dengue. The absence of effective drugs and vaccines leaves vector control as the primary intervention tool. Understanding dengue virus (DENV) host interactions is essential for the development of novel control strategies. The availability of genome sequences for both human and mosquito host greatly facilitates genome-wide studies of DENV-host interactions.ResultsWe developed the first draft of the mosquito protein interaction network using a computational approach. The weighted network includes 4,214 Aedes aegypti proteins with 10,209 interactions, among which 3,500 proteins are connected into an interconnected scale-free network. We demonstrated the application of this network for the further annotation of mosquito proteins and dissection of pathway crosstalk. Using three datasets based on physical interaction assays, genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens and microarray assays, we identified 714 putative DENV-associated mosquito proteins. An integrated analysis of these proteins in the network highlighted four regions consisting of highly interconnected proteins with closely related functions in each of replication/transcription/translation (RTT), immunity, transport and metabolism. Putative DENV-associated proteins were further selected for validation by RNAi-mediated gene silencing, and dengue viral titer in mosquito midguts was significantly reduced for five out of ten (50.0%) randomly selected genes.ConclusionsOur results indicate the presence of common host requirements for DENV in mosquitoes and humans. We discuss the significance of our findings for pharmacological intervention and genetic modification of mosquitoes for blocking dengue transmission.

TI  - Response to Dengue virus infections altered by cytokine-like substances from mosquito cell cultures
JF  - BMC Microbiology
VL  - 10
SP  - 290
EP  - 290
AB  - BackgroundWith both shrimp and commercial insects such as honey bees, it is known that stable, persistent viral infections characterized by absence of disease can sometimes shift to overt disease states as a result of various stress triggers and that this can result in serious economic losses. The main research interest of our group is to understand the dynamics of stable viral infections in shrimp and how they can be destabilized by stress. Since there are no continuous cell lines for crustaceans, we have used a C6/36 mosquito cell line infected with Dengue virus to test hypotheses regarding these interactions. As a result, we accidentally discovered two new cytokine-like substances in 5 kDa extracts from supernatant solutions of acutely and persistently infected mosquito cells.ResultsNaïve C6/36 cells were exposed for 48 h to 5 kDa membrane filtrates prepared from the supernatant medium of stable C6/36 mosquito cell cultures persistently-infected with Dengue virus. Subsequent challenge of naïve cells with a virulent stock of Dengue virus 2 (DEN-2) and analysis by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-DEN-2 antibody revealed a dramatic reduction in the percentage of DEN-2 infected cells when compared to control cells. Similar filtrates prepared from C6/36 cells with acute DEN-2 infections were used to treat stable C6/36 mosquito cell cultures persistently-infected with Dengue virus. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed destabilization in the form of an apoptosis-like response. Proteinase K treatment removed the cell-altering activities indicating that they were caused by small polypeptides similar to those previously reported from insects.ConclusionsThis is the first report of cytokine-like substances that can alter the responses of mosquito cells to Dengue virus. This simple model system allows detailed molecular studies on insect cytokine production and on cytokine activity in a standard insect cell line.

TI  - Restriction of Flaviviruses by an Interferon-Stimulated Gene SHFL/C19orf66
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 23
AB  - Flaviviruses (the genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family) include many arthropod-borne viruses, often causing life-threatening diseases in humans, such as hemorrhaging and encephalitis. Although the flaviviruses have a significant clinical impact, it has become apparent that flavivirus replication is restricted by cellular factors induced by the interferon (IFN) response, which are called IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). SHFL (shiftless antiviral inhibitor of ribosomal frameshifting) is a novel ISG that inhibits dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections. Interestingly, SHFL functions as a broad-spectrum antiviral factor exhibiting suppressive activity against various types of RNA and DNA viruses. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which SHFL inhibits flavivirus infection and discuss the molecular basis of the inhibitory mechanism using a predicted tertiary structure of SHFL generated by the program AlphaFold2.

TI  - Rethinking the capsid proteins of enveloped viruses: multifunctionality from genome packaging to genome transfection
JF  - The FEBS Journal
VL  - 282
AB  - Regardless of the debate on whether there is a place for viruses in the tree of life, it is consensual that they co‐evolve with their hosts under the pressure of genome minimization. The abundance of multifunctional viral structural proteins is a consequence of this pressure. The molecular key to multifunctionality is the existence of intrinsically disordered domains together with ordered domains in the same protein. Capsid proteins, the hallmark of viruses, are not exceptions because they have coexisting ordered and disordered domains that are crucial for multifunctionality. It is also frequent to find supercharged proteins (i.e. proteins for which the net charge per unit molecular mass is > +0.75/kDa) among viral capsid proteins. All flaviviruses having annotated proteins in the ExPASy Viralzone database have supercharged capsid proteins. Moreover, cell‐penetrating sequences/domains are frequent in viral proteins, even when they are not supercharged. Altogether, the findings strongly suggest that the ability to translocate membranes was acquired, conserved and optimized throughout the evolution of some viral proteins as part of their multifunctionality. The fitness of capsid proteins to translocate membranes carrying genomes was experimentally demonstrated with dengue virus capsid protein. This protein is potentially able to help the fusion process and translocate the RNA genome across the hemifused membrane formed by the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane. In addition, one of the cell‐penetrating domains of the capsid protein also has antibacterial activity. This may be reminiscent of parasitic bacteria–bacteria competition for the same host and shed light on the origins of enveloped viruses.

TI  - Revised Annotation and Characterization of Novel Aedes albopictus miRNAs and Their Potential Functions in Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Biology
VL  - 11
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Ae. albopictus), is a highly invasive species that transmit several arboviruses including dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV). Although several studies have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) in Ae. albopictus, it is crucial to extend and improve current annotations with the newly improved genome assembly, and the increase number of small RNA-sequencing data. We combined our high-depth sequence data and 26 public datasets to re-annotate Ae. albopictus miRNAs, and found a total of 110 novel mature miRNAs. We discovered that the expression of novel miRNAs was lower than known miRNAs. Furthermore, compared to known miRNAs, novel miRNAs are prone to be expressed in stage-specific manner. Upon DENV infection, a total of 59 novel miRNAs were differentially expressed, and target prediction analysis revealed that miRNA-target genes were involved in lipid metabolism and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. Taken together, miRNA annotation profile provided here is the most comprehensive to date, and we believed that this will facilitate future research in understanding virus-host interactions particularly on the role of miRNAs.

TI  - Revisiting dengue virus-mosquito interactions: molecular insights into viral fitness
JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 102
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), like other viruses, closely interacts with the host cell machinery to complete its life cycle. Over the course of infection, DENV interacts with several host factors with pro-viral activities to support its infection. Meanwhile, it has to evade or counteract host factors with anti-viral activities which inhibit its infection. These molecular virus-host interactions play a crucial role in determining the success of DENV infection. Deciphering such interactions is thus paramount to understanding viral fitness in its natural hosts. While DENV-mammalian host interactions have been extensively studied, not much has been done to characterize DENV-mosquito host interactions despite its importance in controlling DENV transmission. Here, to provide a snapshot of our current understanding of DENV-mosquito interactions, we review the literature that identified host factors and cellular processes related to DENV infection in its mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, with a particular focus on DENV-mosquito omics studies. This knowledge provides fundamental insights into the DENV life cycle, and could contribute to the development of novel antiviral strategies.

JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 48
SP  - 9872
EP  - 9885
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) and other mosquito-borne flaviviruses are highly dependent on the ribosomal stalk proteins, RPLP1 and RPLP2 (RPLP1/2), for efficient infection. Here, we show that RPLP1/2 function to relieve ribosome pausing within the DENV envelope coding sequence, leading to enhanced protein stability. We used ribosome profiling to evaluate viral and cellular translation in RPLP1/2-depleted cells. This revealed that ribosomes pause in the sequence coding for the N-terminus of the envelope protein, immediately downstream of sequences encoding two adjacent transmembrane domains (TMDs). RPLP1/2 function to enhance ribosome elongation at this position and increase viral protein stability, possibly by improving co-translational folding of DENV proteins. We also analyzed the effects of RPLP1/2 depletion on cellular translation. We find that RPLP1/2 affects ribosome density for a small subset of cellular mRNAs. However, meta-analysis of ribosome positions on all cellular mRNAs revealed slightly increased accumulation of ribosomes downstream of start codons in RPLP1/2-depleted cells, suggesting that RPLP1/2 enhance elongation efficiency. Importantly, we found that ribosome density on mRNAs encoding multiple TMDs was disproportionately affected by RPLP1/2 knockdown, implying a role for RPLP1/2 in transmembrane protein biogenesis. Together, our findings reveal insights into the function of RPLP1/2 in DENV and cellular translation.

TI  - Role of Complement in Dengue Virus Infection: Protection or Pathogenesis?
JF  - mBio
VL  - 3
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue viruses (DENV) cause a spectrum of disease in humans, ranging from dengue fever (DF) to a severe, life-threatening syndrome called dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Despite the global morbidity and mortality associated with DENV infection, mechanisms of immune control and viral pathogenesis are poorly understood. In a recent article, Avirutnan et al. [mBio 2(6):e00276-11, 2011] demonstrated that DENV can be directly neutralized via the mannose binding lectin (MBL) pathway of the complement system and that deficiency in MBL level or activity due to host polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene correlates with reduced levels of DENV neutralization. These findings implicate a role for the MBL pathway in controlling DENV infections and modulating DHF/DSS manifestations.

AB  - Flavivirus replication in host cells requires the formation of replication and assembly complexes on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. These complexes consist of an ER membrane, viral proteins, and host proteins. Genome-wide investigations have identified a number of ER multiprotein complexes as vital factors for flavivirus replication. The detailed mechanisms of the role of ER complexes in flavivirus replication are still largely elusive. This review highlights the fact that the ER multiprotein complexes are crucial for the formation of flavivirus replication and assembly complexes, and the ER complexes could be considered as a target for developing successful broad-spectrum anti-flavivirus drugs.

EP  - 
AB  - Dengue is a disease caused by a flavivirus (DENV) and transmitted by the bite of a mosquito, primarily the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus species. Previous studies have demonstrated a relationship between the host gut microbiota and the evolution of dengue. It seems to be a bidirectional relationship, in which the DENV can affect the microbiota by inducing alterations related to intestinal permeability, leading to the release of molecules from microbiota dysbiosis that can influence the evolution of dengue. The role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in the microbiota/dengue relationship is not well understood, but it is known that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is present in the intestinal tract and interacts with the gut microbiota. The possible effect of Ang II on the microbiota/Ang II/dengue relationship can be summarised as follows: the presence of Ang II induced hypertension, the increase in angiotensinogen, chymase, and microRNAs during the disease, the induction of vascular dysfunction, the production of trimethylamine N-oxide and the brain/microbiota relationship, all of which are elements present in dengue that could be part of the microbiota/Ang II/dengue interactions. These findings suggest the potential use of Ang II synthesis blockers and the use of AT1 receptor antagonists as therapeutic drugs in dengue.

TI  - Role of Host-Mediated Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) in RNA Virus Pathogenesis
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 22
AB  - Being opportunistic intracellular pathogens, viruses are dependent on the host for their replication. They hijack host cellular machinery for their replication and survival by targeting crucial cellular physiological pathways, including transcription, translation, immune pathways, and apoptosis. Immediately after translation, the host and viral proteins undergo a process called post-translational modification (PTM). PTMs of proteins involves the attachment of small proteins, carbohydrates/lipids, or chemical groups to the proteins and are crucial for the proteins’ functioning. During viral infection, host proteins utilize PTMs to control the virus replication, using strategies like activating immune response pathways, inhibiting viral protein synthesis, and ultimately eliminating the virus from the host. PTM of viral proteins increases solubility, enhances antigenicity and virulence properties. However, RNA viruses are devoid of enzymes capable of introducing PTMs to their proteins. Hence, they utilize the host PTM machinery to promote their survival. Proteins from viruses belonging to the family: Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Retroviridae, and Coronaviridae such as chikungunya, dengue, zika, HIV, and coronavirus are a few that are well-known to be modified. This review discusses various host and virus-mediated PTMs that play a role in the outcome during the infection.

AB  - Dengue is currently regarded as the most common arthropod-borne viral disease in tropical and subtropical areas, with an estimated 50-100 million infections occurring each year. Nearly all patients experience a self-limiting clinical course; however, the illness ranges from undifferentiated fever to severe hemorrhagic fever with or without shock syndrome complications. There are several immune cells associated with the pathogenesis of dengue virus (DENV) infection and systemic spread, including dendritic cells, macrophages, and mast cells (MCs). MCs are widely recognized for their immune functions and as cellular regulators of vascular integrity in human skin. Furthermore, these cells are able to detect DENV, which results in activation and degranulation of potent vasoactive mediators prestored in the granules. These mediators can act directly on vascular endothelium, increasing permeability and inducing vascular leakage. This review is designed to present an insight into the role of MCs during DENV infection and the dual functions in immune protection and contribution to the most severe forms of dengue.

JF  - Journal of Molecular and Genetic Medicine

SP  - 1
EP  - 3
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito–borne acute viral disease with ubiquitous distribution in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Dengue virus (DENV) infection is transmitted by the bite of a female Aedes aegypti mosquito (the most important vector) infected with DENV. Clinical presentation of this typical arboviral disease varies along a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms. During the course of DENV infection, some individuals develop severe manifestations relates to plasma leakage into tissues caused by increased vascular permeability. The severity of dengue disease may vary considerably according to age, ethnicity, genetic factors, immune status and underlying disease. It may also depend on the co-circulation of DENV serotypes and sequential (secondary) infections with different DENV serotypes. While the exact mechanism of pathogenesis of dengue remains elusive, several lines of evidence demonstrating that DENV infection-derived oxidative stress may trigger the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, participating in collective action in dengue disease pathogenesis. In conclusion, we review these findings and discuss about the recent advances that propose a major role of oxidative-nitrosative stress on dengue pathogenesis.

JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Platelets are anucleated blood cells derived from bone marrow megakaryocytes and play a crucial role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Platelets contain specialized storage organelles, called alpha-granules, contents of which are rich in cytokines such as C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand (CXCL) 1/4/7, (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 5/3, CXCL8 (also called as interleukin 8, IL-8), and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Activation of platelets lead to degranulation and release of contents into the plasma. Platelet activation is a common event in many viral infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), H1N1 influenza, Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus (EBV), and Dengue virus (DENV). The cytokines CXCL8, CCL5 (also known as Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted, RANTES), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), CXCL1/5 and CCL3 released, promote development of a pro-inflammatory state along with the recruitment of other immune cells to the site of infection. Platelets also interact with Monocytes and Neutrophils and facilitate their activation to release different cytokines which further enhances inflammation. Upon activation, platelets also secrete factors such as CXCL4 (also known as platelet factor, PF4), CCL5 and fibrinopeptides which are critical regulators of replication and propagation of several viruses in the host. Studies suggest that CXCL4 can both inhibit as well as enhance HIV1 infection. Data from our lab show that CXCL4 inhibits interferon (IFN) pathway and promotes DENV replication in monocytes in vitro and in patients significantly. Inhibition of CXCL4 mediated signaling results in increased IFN production and suppressed DENV and JEV replication in monocytes. In this review, we discuss the role of platelets in viral disease progression with a focus on dengue infection.

TI  - Role of Pro-inflammatory IL-8 and Anti-inflammatory IL-10 Cytokines in Dengue Severity
JF  - Journal of Communicable Diseases
AB  - Introduction: During dengue infection, cytokine levels may increase as various cytokines are released from infected inflammatory cells. This study was conducted to measure the levels of cytokines IL-8 and IL-10 in dengue patients and correlate them with dengue severity. Material & Methods: A prospective study was conducted on febrile patients suspected of dengue fever, seeking medical care in our institute. 107 cases confirmed to have dengue fever (by NS1/ IgM ELISA) and 100 healthy individuals with age and sex matched, were included in the study. The clinical features of all patients were recorded, and cytokine levels of IL-8 and IL-10 were estimated by ELISA in the dengue patients and healthy controls. Results: Out of 400 febrile patients suspected of having dengue fever, 107 (26.75%) cases were confirmed cases, of which 56 (52.3%), 20 (18.7%), and 31 (29%) were positive for only NS1 antigen, only IgM antibody, and both NS1 and IgM, respectively. Depending on the severity of the disease, 9 (8.5%) cases were classified as severe dengue cases while 98 (91.5%) as non-severe dengue fever. Mean levels (pg/ml) for IL-8 were 281.6 ± 76.6, 150.41 ± 55.9 and 75.4 ± 49.2 in severe dengue, dengue fever, and healthy controls respectively while for IL-10, the values were 219.4 ± 150.5, 38.9 ± 67.2, and 6.6 ± 0.65 among severe dengue cases, dengue cases, and healthy controls, respectively. Conclusion: Mean level of cytokines IL-8 and IL-10 were significantly raised in severe dengue patients as compared to non-severe dengue patients and healthy controls, suggesting their role in causing severe disease and as a potential predictor for disease severity and fatal outcome.

TI  - Role of RNA Interference (RNAi) in Dengue Virus Replication and Identification of NS4B as an RNAi Suppressor
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 8870
EP  - 8883
AB  - ABSTRACT RNA interference (RNAi) is an important antiviral defense response in plants and invertebrates; however, evidences for its contribution to mammalian antiviral defense are few. In the present study, we demonstrate the anti-dengue virus role of RNAi in mammalian cells. Dengue virus infection of Huh 7 cells decreased the mRNA levels of host RNAi factors, namely, Dicer, Drosha, Ago1, and Ago2, and in corollary, silencing of these genes in virus-infected cells enhanced dengue virus replication. In addition, we observed downregulation of many known human microRNAs (miRNAs) in response to viral infection. Using reversion-of-silencing assays, we further showed that NS4B of all four dengue virus serotypes is a potent RNAi suppressor. We generated a series of deletion mutants and demonstrated that NS4B mediates RNAi suppression via its middle and C-terminal domains, namely, transmembrane domain 3 (TMD3) and TMD5. Importantly, the NS4B N-terminal region, including the signal sequence 2K, which has been implicated in interferon (IFN)-antagonistic properties, was not involved in mediating RNAi suppressor activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues revealed that a Phe-to-Ala (F112A) mutation in the TMD3 region resulted in a significant reduction of the RNAi suppression activity. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-small interfering RNA (siRNA) biogenesis of the GFP-silenced line was considerably reduced by wild-type NS4B, while the F112A mutant abrogated this reduction. These results were further confirmed by in vitro dicer assays. Together, our results suggest the involvement of miRNA/RNAi pathways in dengue virus establishment and that dengue virus NS4B protein plays an important role in the modulation of the host RNAi/miRNA pathway to favor dengue virus replication.

TI  - Role of Soluble Fas Ligand in Severity of Dengue Disease
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - Dengue disease, which is caused by dengue virus infection, is a major public health in the tropical and subtropical countries in the world. It has a wide spectrum of clinical mani-festations ranging from an undifferentiated fever in a mild clinical form (dengue fever [DF]) to the severe clinical and potentially fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Recently, a study has suggested that excessive inflammation and apoptosis contribute to the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease. Soluble FasL is a type II membrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, which induces apoptosis in Fas-bearing cells and neutrophil chemotactic functions. The apoptosis of microvascular endothelial cells may explain the plasma leakage mechanism in DHF and there was a significant increase in soluble Fas-ligand level in DHF patients compared to DF patients. It can be concluded that the soluble Fas ligand is related to the pathogenesis of dengue infection.

TI  - Role of Vigilin and RACK1 in dengue virus-Aedes aegypti-Wolbachia interactions
JF  - mSphere
VL  - 10
AB  - ABSTRACT Vigilin is a large and evolutionary conserved RNA-binding protein (RBP), which can interact with RNA through its KH domain. Vigilin is, therefore, a multifunctional protein reported to be associated with RNA transport and metabolism, sterol metabolism, chromosome segregation, carcinogenesis, and heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing. The receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is another highly conserved protein involved in many cellular pathways. Functional studies in human cells indicated that RACK1 interacts with Vigilin to promote dengue virus (DENV) replication. Both proteins are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we investigated the significance of Vigilin and RACK1 homologs in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes concerning DENV replication and Wolbachia infection. We identified the homologs of the two genes in Ae. aegypti (AeVigilin and AeRACK1), which were upregulated in DENV-infected Aag2 cells and mosquitoes, and silencing them in Aag2 cells resulted in reduced DENV replication. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that AeRACK1 and AeVigilin interact in mosquito cells. Interestingly, we also found upregulation of both genes in a Wolbachia-infected cell line (Aag2.wAlbB). Furthermore, silencing AeVigilin and AeRACK1 in Aag2.wAlbB cells reduced DENV replication but increased Wolbachia density. However, we did not find a significant effect on DENV replication after silencing both genes in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Overall, our results support the involvement and significance of AeVigilin and AeRACK1 in DENV replication in Ae. aegypti. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV), transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, poses significant health risks. Identifying factors involved in the virus replication in mosquitoes and human hosts is essential for devising control measures. In this study, we show that Vigilin and the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), two proteins shown to play a role in the replication of DENV in human cells, are induced in mosquitoes and cell lines following DENV replication. Both proteins reside in the cytoplasm, where they interact similarly to human cells. Silencing the genes in mosquito cells significantly reduced virus replication. Furthermore, we found that both genes are induced in mosquito cells transinfected with Wolbachia, a bacterium that blocks DENV replication. The results help better understand the role of the common factors supporting DENV replication in mosquitoes and human cells.

TI  - Role of autophagy during the replication and pathogenesis of common mosquito-borne flavi- and alphaviruses
JF  - Open Biology
VL  - 9
AB  - Arboviruses that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes represent one of the most important causes of febrile illness worldwide. In recent decades, we have witnessed a dramatic re-emergence of several mosquito-borne arboviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). DENV is currently the most common mosquito-borne arbovirus, with an estimated 390 million infections worldwide annually. Despite a global effort, no specific therapeutic strategies are available to combat the diseases caused by these viruses. Multiple cellular pathways modulate the outcome of infection by either promoting or hampering viral replication and/or pathogenesis, and autophagy appears to be one of them. Autophagy is a degradative pathway generally induced to counteract viral infection. Viruses, however, have evolved strategies to subvert this pathway and to hijack autophagy components for their own benefit. In this review, we will focus on the role of autophagy in mosquito-borne arboviruses with emphasis on DENV, CHIKV, WNV and ZIKV, due to their epidemiological importance and high disease burden.

TI  - Role of microRNAs in antiviral responses to dengue infection
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 27
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the etiological agent of dengue fever. Severe dengue could be fatal and there is currently no effective antiviral agent or vaccine. The only licensed vaccine, Dengvaxia, has low efficacy against serotypes 1 and 2. Cellular miRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators that could play a role in direct regulation of viral genes. Host miRNA expressions could either promote or repress viral replications. Induction of some cellular miRNAs could help the virus to evade the host immune response by suppressing the IFN-α/β signaling pathway while others could upregulate IFN-α/β production and inhibit the viral infection. Understanding miRNA expressions and functions during dengue infections would provide insights into the development of miRNA-based therapeutics which could be strategized to act either as miRNA antagonists or miRNA mimics. The known mechanisms of how miRNAs impact DENV replication are diverse. They could suppress DENV multiplication by directly binding to the viral genome, resulting in translational repression. Other miRNA actions include modulation of host factors. In addition, miRNAs that could modulate immunopathogenesis are discussed. Major hurdles lie in the development of chemical modifications and delivery systems for in vivo delivery. Nevertheless, advancement in miRNA formulations and delivery systems hold great promise for the therapeutic potential of miRNA-based therapy, as supported by Miravirsen for treatment of Hepatitis C infection which has successfully completed phase II clinical trial.

AB  - Dengue is potentially a life-threatening arthropod-borne viral infection for which there are no known therapeutic agents till date. Early stage diagnosis of dengue infection is still lacking. Diagnosis is only made after severe manifestations and later stages of infection. Timely prognosis can prevent dengue related mortalities. The nucleic acid-based therapy has potential to emerge as a promising approach for early diagnosis and treatment of this viral infection. Many studies have been carried out suggested the regulatory role of ncRNAs thereby revealing the importance of protein-RNA and RNA-RNA interactions during infection. Various regulatory RNAs are either expressed by mammalian cells or generated by viral RNA have reported to play important roles in viral life cycle including dengue virus. Thus exploring host-virus interaction will pave the novel path for understanding the pathophysiology of febrile infection in dengue. Rapid advances in sequencing techniques along with significant developments in the field of RNA studies has made RNA therapeutics as one of the promising approaches as antiviral targets. The idea of RNA based therapies has been greatly backed by a Hepatitis C virus drug, Miravirsen which has successfully completed phase II clinical trial. In the present review, we will discuss the implications of different non-coding RNAs in dengue infection. Differential expression of small ncRNA may serve as a reliable biomarker of disease severity during different stages of infection and can also play regulatory roles in disease progression.

We evaluated the role of CC chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2 and CCR4 in an experimental model of DENV-2 infection in mice. Infection of mice induced evident clinical disease and tissue damage, including thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, lymphopenia, increased levels of transaminases and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and lethality in WT mice. Importantly, infected WT mice presented increased levels of chemokines CCL2/JE, CCL3/MIP-1α and CCL5/RANTES in spleen and liver. CCR1-/- mice had a mild phenotype with disease presentation and lethality similar to those of WT mice. In CCR2-/- mice, lethality, liver damage, levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ, and leukocyte activation were attenuated. However, thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration and systemic TNF-α levels were similar to infected WT mice. Infection enhanced levels of CCL17/TARC, a CCR4 ligand. In CCR4-/- mice, lethality, tissue injury and systemic inflammation were markedly decreased. Despite differences in disease presentation in CCR-deficient mice, there was no significant difference in viral load. In conclusion, activation of chemokine receptors has discrete roles in the pathogenesis of dengue infection. These studies suggest that the chemokine storm that follows severe primary dengue infection associates mostly to development of disease rather than protection.

TI  - Role of the Microbiome in Aedes spp. Vector Competence: What Do We Know?
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the vectors of important arboviruses: dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever. Female mosquitoes acquire arboviruses by feeding on the infected host blood, thus being able to transmit it to their offspring. The intrinsic ability of a vector to infect itself and transmit a pathogen is known as vector competence. Several factors influence the susceptibility of these females to be infected by these arboviruses, such as the activation of the innate immune system through the Toll, immunodeficiency (Imd), JAK-STAT pathways, and the interference of specific antiviral response pathways of RNAi. It is also believed that the presence of non-pathogenic microorganisms in the microbiota of these arthropods could influence this immune response, as it provides a baseline activation of the innate immune system, which may generate resistance against arboviruses. In addition, this microbiome has direct action against arboviruses, mainly due to the ability of Wolbachia spp. to block viral genome replication, added to the competition for resources within the mosquito organism. Despite major advances in the area, studies are still needed to evaluate the microbiota profiles of Aedes spp. and their vector competence, as well as further exploration of the individual roles of microbiome components in activating the innate immune system.

TI  - Roles and Prospects of Dengue Virus Non-structural Proteins as Antiviral Targets: An Easy Digest
JF  - The Malaysian Journal of Medical Sciences : MJMS
VL  - 25
SP  - 6
EP  - 15
AB  - Dengue is a neglected disease caused by the infection of dengue virus which is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and to some, it could be fatal. Regardless of the enormous work devoted to research for the treatment of dengue, to this day there is no cure, and treatment is solely limited to supportive care by treating the symptoms. The inhibition of the viral RNA non-structural enzymes has been the most popular approach amongst the strategies applied to the search and development of dengue antivirals. This review is a compact digest of what is already known of the roles and the prospects of the dengue virus non-structural proteins NS1, NS2BNS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 as the targets for antiviral studies including the recent progress that has been published regarding their roles.

TI  - Roles of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor in Dengue Pathogenesis: From Pathogenic Factor to Therapeutic Target
JF  - Microorganisms
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral infection and can lead to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and even life-threatening dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Although the cytokine storm has been revealed as a critical factor in dengue disease, the limited understanding of dengue immunopathogenesis hinders the development of effective treatments. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine that mediates diverse immune responses, and the serum level of MIF positively correlates with disease severity in patients with dengue. MIF is involved in DENV replication and many pathological changes, such as vascular leakage, during DENV infection. In this paper, the pathogenic roles of MIF and the regulation of MIF secretion during DENV infection are reviewed. Furthermore, whether MIF is a potential therapeutic target against DENV infection is also discussed.

TI  - Roles of NS1 Protein in Flavivirus Pathogenesis.
JF  - ACS infectious diseases
AB  - Flaviviruses such as dengue, Zika, and West Nile viruses are highly concerning pathogens that pose significant risks to public health. The NS1 protein is conserved among flaviviruses and is synthesized as a part of the flavivirus polyprotein. It plays a critical role in viral replication, disease progression, and immune evasion. Post-translational modifications influence NS1's stability, secretion, antigenicity, and interactions with host factors. NS1 protein forms extensive interactions with host cellular proteins allowing it to affect vital processes such as RNA processing, gene expression regulation, and cellular homeostasis, which in turn influence viral replication, disease pathogenesis, and immune responses. NS1 acts as an immune evasion factor by delaying complement-dependent lysis of infected cells and contributes to disease pathogenesis by inducing endothelial cell damage and vascular leakage and triggering autoimmune responses. Anti-NS1 antibodies have been shown to cross-react with host endothelial cells and platelets, causing autoimmune destruction that is hypothesized to contribute to disease pathogenesis. However, in contrast, immunization of animal models with the NS1 protein confers protection against lethal challenges from flaviviruses such as dengue and Zika viruses. Understanding the multifaceted roles of NS1 in flavivirus pathogenesis is crucial for effective disease management and control. Therefore, further research into NS1 biology, including its host protein interactions and additional roles in disease pathology, is imperative for the development of strategies and therapeutics to combat flavivirus infections successfully. This Review provides an in-depth exploration of the current available knowledge on the multifaceted roles of the NS1 protein in the pathogenesis of flaviviruses.

TI  - Roles of Small GTPase Rac1 in the Regulation of Actin Cytoskeleton during Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 4
AB  - Background Increased vascular permeability is a hallmark feature in severe dengue virus (DV) infection, and dysfunction of endothelial cells has been speculated to contribute in the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Rho-family GTPase Rac1 is a significant element of endothelial barrier function regulation and has been implicated in the regulation of actin remodeling and intercellular junction formation. Yet there is little evidence linking Rac1 GTPase to alteration in endothelial cell function induced by DV infection. Methods and Findings Here, we showed that actin is essential for DV serotype 2 (DV2) entry into and release from ECV304 cells, and Rac1 signaling is involved these processes. At early infection, actin cytoskeleton rearranged significantly during 1 hour post infection, and disrupting actin filament dynamics with jasplakinolide or cytochalasin D reduced DV2 entry. DV2 entry induced reduction of Rac1 activity within 1 hour post infection. The expression of dominant-negative forms of Rac1 established that DV2 entry is negatively regulated by Rac1. At late infection, actin drugs also inhibited the DV2 release and induced accumulation of viral proteins in the cytoplasm. Meanwhile, the activity of Rac1 increased significantly with the progression of DV2 infection and was up-regulated in transfected cells expressing E protein. Confocal microscopy showed that DV2 E protein was closely associated with either actin or Rac1 in DV2-infected cells. The interaction between E protein and actin was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assay. Conclusions These results defined roles for actin integrity in DV2 entry and release, and indicated evidence for the participation of Rac1 signaling pathways in DV2-induced actin reorganizations and E-actin interaction. Our results may provide further insight into the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS.

TI  - Roles of secretory glycoproteins in particle formation of Flaviviridae viruses
JF  - Microbiology and Immunology
VL  - 63
SP  - 401
EP  - 406
AB  - The family Flaviviridae comprises four genera, namely, Flavivirus, Pestivirus, Pegivirus, and Hepacivirus. These viruses have similar genome structures, but the genomes of Pestivirus and Flavivirus encode the secretory glycoproteins Erns and NS1, respectively. Erns plays an important role in virus particle formation and cell entry, whereas NS1 participates in the formation of replication complexes and virus particles. Conversely, apolipoproteins are known to participate in the formation of infectious particles of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and various secretory glycoproteins play a similar role in HCV particles formation, suggesting that there is no strong specificity for the function of secretory glycoproteins in infectious‐particle formation. In addition, recent studies have shown that host‐derived apolipoproteins and virus‐derived Erns and NS1 play comparable roles in infectious‐particle formation of both HCV and pestiviruses. In this review, we summarize the roles of secretory glycoproteins in the formation of Flaviviridae virus particles.

TI  - S-Phase-Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Virus 2 Replication in Mosquito Cells, but Not in Human Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 13218
EP  - 13230
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DEN) is the most prevalent cause of arthropod-borne viral illness in humans. We determined the influence of cellular growth state on DEN type 2 (DEN2) replication in mosquito and human cells, based on the hypothesis that manipulation of cellular growth state will facilitate identification of viral and cellular determinants of productive infection. Comparison of density-arrested and cycling C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells infected with a low-passage DEN2 isolate revealed that cycling cells generated higher virus titers per cell. When C6/36 cells were stalled in S-phase via a thymidine (THY) block, titers of low-passage DEN2 isolates and a high-passage strain, 16681, were increased approximately 30-fold and 10-fold, respectively. Moreover, virus release was earlier in THY-treated cells than in asynchronously cycling cells. Adsorption, entry, genome uncoating, and translation were not responsible for increased titers of virus from S-phase C6/36 cells. In contrast to the 30-fold increase in virus titers, intracellular levels of viral RNA were increased approximately 2-fold, suggesting that the S-phase-responsive step is late in the DEN2 replication cycle. Analysis of viral RNA and protein released from the cells indicated that enhanced DEN2 assembly is largely responsible for increased virus titers produced during S-phase. In contrast to C6/36 cells, DEN2 titers from S-phase human hepatoma cells or primary human fibroblasts were not increased. These results demonstrate a differential response of DEN2 to the mosquito and human cell cycle and provide a framework for detailed studies into the mechanisms mediating virus assembly.

TI  - SB203580 Modulates p38 MAPK Signaling and Dengue Virus-Induced Liver Injury by Reducing MAPKAPK2, HSP27, and ATF2 Phosphorylation
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 11
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes organ injuries, and the liver is one of the most important sites of DENV infection, where viral replication generates a high viral load. The molecular mechanism of DENV-induced liver injury is still under investigation. The mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38 MAPK, have roles in the hepatic cell apoptosis induced by DENV. However, the in vivo role of p38 MAPK in DENV-induced liver injury is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, in a mouse model of DENV infection. Both the hematological parameters, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, were improved by SB203580 treatment and liver transaminases and histopathology were also improved. We used a real-time PCR microarray to profile the expression of apoptosis-related genes. Tumor necrosis factor α, caspase 9, caspase 8, and caspase 3 proteins were significantly lower in the SB203580-treated DENV-infected mice than that in the infected control mice. Increased expressions of cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10, and chemokines including RANTES and IP-10 in DENV infection were reduced by SB203580 treatment. DENV infection induced the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, and its downstream signals including MAPKAPK2, HSP27 and ATF-2. SB203580 treatment did not decrease the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, but it significantly reduced the phosphorylation of MAPKAPK2, HSP27, and ATF2. Therefore, SB203580 modulates the downstream signals to p38 MAPK and reduces DENV-induced liver injury.

TI  - SIRT6 Acts as a Negative Regulator in Dengue Virus-Induced Inflammatory Response by Targeting the DNA Binding Domain of NF-κB p65
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne single-stranded RNA virus causing human disease with variable severity. The production of massive inflammatory cytokines in dengue patients has been associated with dengue disease severity. However, the regulation of these inflammatory responses remains unclear. In this study, we report that SIRT6 is a negative regulator of innate immune responses during DENV infection. Silencing of Sirt6 enhances DENV-induced proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. Overexpression of SIRT6 inhibits RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) mediated NF-κB activation. The sirtuin core domain of SIRT6 is required for the inhibition of NF-κB p65 function. SIRT6 interacts with the DNA binding domain of p65 and competes with p65 to occupy the Il6 promoter during DENV infection. Collectively, our study demonstrates that SIRT6 negatively regulates DENV-induced inflammatory response via RLR and TLR3 signaling pathways.

TI  - STAT2 Mediates Innate Immunity to Dengue Virus in the Absence of STAT1 via the Type I Interferon Receptor
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 7
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, and symptoms of infection range from asymptomatic to the severe dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). High viral loads correlate with disease severity, and both type I & II interferons (IFNs) are crucial for controlling viral replication. We have previously reported that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1-deficient mice are resistant to DENV-induced disease, but little is known about this STAT1-independent mechanism of protection. To determine the molecular basis of the STAT1-independent pathway, mice lacking STAT1, STAT2, or both STAT1 and STAT2 were infected with a virulent mouse-adapted strain of DENV2. In the first 72 hours of infection, the single-deficient mice lacking STAT1 or STAT2 possessed 50–100 fold higher levels of viral RNA than wild type mice in the serum, spleen, and other visceral tissues, but remained resistant to DENV-induced death. In contrast, the double-deficient mice exhibited the early death phenotype previously observed in type I and II IFN receptor knockout mice (AG129), indicating that STAT2 is the mediator of the STAT1-independent host defense mechanism. Further studies demonstrated that this STAT2-dependent STAT1-independent mechanism requires the type I IFN receptor, and contributes to the autocrine amplification of type I IFN expression. Examination of gene expression in the spleen and bone marrow-derived macrophages following DENV infection revealed STAT2-dependent pathways can induce the transcription of a subset of interferon stimulated genes even in the absence of STAT1. Collectively, these results help elucidate the nature of the poorly understood STAT1-independent host defense mechanism against viruses by identifying a functional type I IFN/STAT2 signaling pathway following DENV infection in vivo.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is an important human pathogen whose byzantine relationship with the immune response is poorly understood. DENV causes dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, diseases for which palliative care is the only treatment. DENV immunopathogenesis studies are complicated by the lack of an immunocompetent small-animal model, and this has hindered anti-DENV drug and vaccine development. This review describes strategies that DENV uses to evade the type I interferon response and focuses on how data gained from the study of DENV NS5-mediated STAT2 degradation may be used to create immunocompetent DENV mouse models and design anti-DENV therapeutics.

TI  - STAT2-Dependent Immune Responses Ensure Host Survival despite the Presence of a Potent Viral Antagonist
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 92
AB  - ABSTRACT A pathogen encounter induces interferons, which signal via Janus kinases and STAT transcription factors to establish an antiviral state. However, the host and pathogens are situated in a continuous arms race which shapes host evolution toward optimized immune responses and the pathogens toward enhanced immune-evasive properties. Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) counteracts interferon responses by pM27-mediated degradation of STAT2, which directly affects the signaling of type I as well as type III interferons. Using MCMV mutants lacking M27 and mice lacking STAT2, we studied the opposing relationship between antiviral activities and viral antagonism in a natural host-pathogen pair in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to wild-type (wt) MCMV, ΔM27 mutant MCMV was efficiently cleared from all organs within a few days in BALB/c, C57BL/6, and 129 mice, highlighting the general importance of STAT2 antagonism for MCMV replication. Despite this effective and relevant STAT2 antagonism, wt and STAT2-deficient mice exhibited fundamentally different susceptibilities to MCMV infections. MCMV replication was increased in all assessed organs (e.g., liver, spleen, lungs, and salivary glands) of STAT2-deficient mice, resulting in mortality during the first week after infection. Taken together, the results of our study reveal the importance of cytomegaloviral interferon antagonism for viral replication as well as a pivotal role of the remaining STAT2 activity for host survival. This mutual influence establishes a stable evolutionary standoff situation with fatal consequences when the equilibrium is disturbed. IMPORTANCE The host limits viral replication by the use of interferons (IFNs), which signal via STAT proteins. Several viruses evolved antagonists targeting STATs to antagonize IFNs (e.g., cytomegaloviruses, Zika virus, dengue virus, and several paramyxoviruses). We analyzed infections caused by MCMV expressing or lacking the STAT2 antagonist pM27 in STAT2-deficient and control mice to evaluate its importance for the host and the virus in vitro and in vivo. The inability to counteract STAT2 directly translates into exaggerated IFN susceptibility in vitro and pronounced attenuation in vivo. Thus, the antiviral activity mediated by IFNs via STAT2-dependent signaling drove the development of a potent MCMV-encoded STAT2 antagonist which became indispensable for efficient virus replication and spread to organs required for dissemination. Despite this clear impact of viral STAT2 antagonism, the host critically required the remaining STAT2 activity to prevent overt disease and mortality upon MCMV infection. Our findings highlight a remarkably delicate balance between host and virus.

TI  - STAT5: a Target of Antagonism by Neurotropic Flaviviruses
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - Flaviviruses are a diverse group of insect-borne viruses responsible for numerous significant public health threats. Previously, we used a computational biology approach to define molecular signatures of antiviral DC responses following activation of innate immune signaling or infection with West Nile virus (WNV). In this work, we identify STAT5 as a regulator of DC activation and antiviral immune responses downstream of innate immune signaling that was not activated during either WNV or Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. WNV and ZIKV actively blocked STAT5 phosphorylation downstream of RIG-I, IFN-β, and IL-4, but not GM-CSF, signaling. However, other related flaviviruses, dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 and the yellow fever 17D vaccine strain, did not antagonize STAT5 phosphorylation. Mechanistically, WNV and ZIKV showed differential inhibition of Jak kinases upstream of STAT5, suggesting divergent countermeasures to inhibit STAT5 activation. Combined, these findings identify STAT5 as a target of antagonism by specific pathogenic flaviviruses to subvert antiviral immune responses in human DCs. ABSTRACT Flaviviruses are a diverse group of arthropod-borne viruses responsible for numerous significant public health threats; therefore, understanding the interactions between these viruses and the human immune response remains vital. West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infect human dendritic cells (DCs) and can block antiviral immune responses in DCs. Previously, we used mRNA sequencing and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to define molecular signatures of antiviral DC responses following activation of innate immune signaling (RIG-I, MDA5, or type I interferon [IFN] signaling) or infection with WNV. Using this approach, we found that several genes involved in T cell cosignaling and antigen processing were not enriched in DCs during WNV infection. Using cis-regulatory sequence analysis, STAT5 was identified as a regulator of DC activation and immune responses downstream of innate immune signaling that was not activated during either WNV or ZIKV infection. Mechanistically, WNV and ZIKV actively blocked STAT5 phosphorylation downstream of RIG-I, IFN-β, and interleukin-4 (IL-4), but not granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), signaling. Unexpectedly, dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 (DENV1 to DENV4) and the yellow fever 17D vaccine strain (YFV-17D) did not antagonize STAT5 phosphorylation. In contrast to WNV, ZIKV inhibited JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylation following type I IFN treatment, suggesting divergent mechanisms used by these viruses to inhibit STAT5 activation. Combined, these findings identify STAT5 as a target of antagonism by specific pathogenic flaviviruses to subvert the immune response in infected DCs. IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses are a diverse group of insect-borne viruses responsible for numerous significant public health threats. Previously, we used a computational biology approach to define molecular signatures of antiviral DC responses following activation of innate immune signaling or infection with West Nile virus (WNV). In this work, we identify STAT5 as a regulator of DC activation and antiviral immune responses downstream of innate immune signaling that was not activated during either WNV or Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. WNV and ZIKV actively blocked STAT5 phosphorylation downstream of RIG-I, IFN-β, and IL-4, but not GM-CSF, signaling. However, other related flaviviruses, dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 and the yellow fever 17D vaccine strain, did not antagonize STAT5 phosphorylation. Mechanistically, WNV and ZIKV showed differential inhibition of Jak kinases upstream of STAT5, suggesting divergent countermeasures to inhibit STAT5 activation. Combined, these findings identify STAT5 as a target of antagonism by specific pathogenic flaviviruses to subvert antiviral immune responses in human DCs.

TI  - SUMO Modification Stabilizes Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 5 To Support Virus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90

EP  - 4319
AB  - ABSTRACT Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) participates in a reversible posttranslational modification process (SUMOylation) that regulates a wide variety of cellular processes and plays important roles for numerous viruses during infection. However, the roles of viral protein SUMOylation in dengue virus (DENV) infection have not been elucidated. In this study, we found that the SUMOylation pathway was involved in the DENV life cycle, since DENV replication was reduced by silencing the cellular gene Ubc9, which encodes the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for SUMOylation. By in vivo and in vitro SUMOylation assays, the DENV NS5 protein was identified as an authentic SUMO-targeted protein. By expressing various NS5 mutants, we found that the SUMO acceptor sites are located in the N-terminal domain of NS5 and that a putative SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) of this domain is crucial for its SUMOylation. A DENV replicon harboring the SUMOylation-defective SIM mutant showed a severe defect in viral RNA replication, supporting the notion that NS5 SUMOylation is required for DENV replication. SUMOylation-defective mutants also failed to suppress the induction of STAT2-mediated host antiviral interferon signaling. Furthermore, the SUMOylation of NS5 significantly increased the stability of NS5 protein, which could account for most of the biological functions of SUMOylated NS5. Collectively, these findings suggest that the SUMOylation of DENV NS5 is one of the mechanisms regulating DENV replication. IMPORTANCE SUMOylation is a common posttranslational modification that regulates cellular protein functions but has not been reported in the proteins of dengue virus. Here, we found that the replicase of DENV, nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), can be SUMOylated. It is well known that providing RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and antagonizing host antiviral IFN signaling are a “double indemnity” of NS5 to support DENV replication. Without SUMOylation, NS5 fails to maintain its protein stability, which consequently disrupts its function in viral RNA replication and innate immunity antagonism. DENV threatens billions of people worldwide, but no licensed vaccine or specific therapeutics are currently available. Thus, our findings suggest that rather than specifically targeting NS5 enzyme activity, NS5 protein stability is a novel drug target on the growing list of anti-DENV strategies.

TI  - SUMOylation Is Essential for Dengue Virus Replication and Transmission in the Mosquito Aedes aegypti
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a reversible post-translational protein modifier. Protein SUMOylation regulates a wide variety of cellular processes and is important for controlling virus replication. Earlier studies suggest that dengue virus envelope protein interacts with Ubc9, the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for protein SUMOylation in mammalian cells. However, little is known about the effect of protein SUMOylation on dengue virus replication in the major dengue vector, Aedes aegypti. Thus, in this study, we investigated the impact of protein SUMOylation on dengue virus replication in A. aegypti. The transcription of A. aegypti Ubc9 was significantly increased in the midgut after a normal blood meal. Silencing AaUbc9 resulted in significant inhibition of dengue virus NS1 protein production, viral genome transcription, and reduced viral titer in the mosquito saliva. In addition, we showed that dengue virus E proteins and prM proteins were SUMOylated post-infection. The amino acid residues K51 and K241 of dengue virus E protein were essential for protein SUMOylation. Taken together, our results reveal that protein SUMOylation contributes to dengue virus replication and transmission in the mosquito A. aegypti. This study introduces the possibility that protein SUMOylation is beneficial for virus replication and facilitates virus transmission from the mosquito.

TI  - Scanning Mutagenesis Studies Reveal a Potential Intramolecular Interaction within the C-Terminal Half of Dengue Virus NS2A Involved in Viral RNA Replication and Virus Assembly and Secretion
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 4281
EP  - 4295
AB  - ABSTRACT The NS2A protein of dengue virus (DENV) has eight predicted transmembrane segments (pTMSs; pTMS1 to pTMS8). NS2A has been shown to participate in RNA replication, virion assembly, and the host antiviral response. However, the role of the amino acid residues within the pTMS regions of NS2A during the virus life cycle is poorly understood. In the study described here, we explored the function of DENV NS2A by introducing a series of double or triple alanine substitutions into the C-terminal half (pTMS4 to pTMS8) of NS2A in the context of a DENV infectious clone or subgenomic replicon. Fourteen (8 within pTMS8) of 35 NS2A mutants displayed a lethal phenotype due to impairment of RNA replication by a replicon assay. Three NS2A mutants with mutations within pTMS7, the CM20, CM25, and CM27 mutants, displayed similar phenotypes, low virus yields (>100-fold reduction), wild-type-like replicon activity, and low infectious virus-like particle yields by transient trans-packaging experiments, suggesting a defect in virus assembly and secretion. The sequencing of revertant viruses derived from CM20, CM25, and CM27 mutant viruses revealed a consensus reversion mutation, leucine (L) to phenylalanine (F), at codon 181 within pTMS7. The introduction of an L181F mutation into a full-length NS2A mutant, i.e., the CM20, CM25, and CM27 constructs, completely restored wild-type infectivity. Notably, L181F also substantially rescued the other severely RNA replication-defective mutants with mutations within pTMS4, pTMS6, and pTMS8, i.e., the CM2, CM3, CM13, CM31, and CM32 mutants. In conclusion, the results revealed the essential roles of pTMS4 to pTMS8 of NS2A in RNA replication and/or virus assembly and secretion. The intramolecular interaction between pTMS7 and pTMS4, pTMS6, or pTMS8 of the NS2A protein was also implicated. IMPORTANCE The reported characterization of the C-terminal half of dengue virus NS2A is the first comprehensive mutagenesis study to investigate the function of flavivirus NS2A involved in the steps of the virus life cycle. In particular, detailed mapping of the amino acid residues within the predicted transmembrane segments (pTMSs) of NS2A involved in RNA replication and/or virus assembly and secretion was performed. A revertant genetics study also revealed that L181F within pTMS7 is a consensus reversion mutation that rescues both RNA replication-defective and virus assembly- and secretion-defective mutants with mutations within the other three pTMSs of NS2A. Collectively, these findings elucidate the role played by NS2A during the virus life cycle, possibly through the intricate intramolecular interaction between pTMS7 and other pTMSs within the NS2A protein.

TI  - Schlafen 11 Restricts Flavivirus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - We provide evidence that the cellular protein Schlafen 11 (Slfn11) impairs replication of flaviviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). However, replication of single-stranded negative RNA viruses was not affected. Specifically, Slfn11 decreases the infectivity of WNV potentially by preventing virus-induced modifications of the host tRNA repertoire that could lead to enhanced viral protein folding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Slfn11 is not the limiting factor of this novel broad antiviral pathway. ABSTRACT Schlafen 11 (Slfn11) is an interferon-stimulated gene that controls the synthesis of proteins by regulating tRNA abundance. Likely through this mechanism, Slfn11 has previously been shown to impair human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the expression of codon-biased open reading frames. Because replication of positive-sense single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA] viruses requires the immediate translation of the incoming viral genome, whereas negative-sense single-stranded RNA [(−)ssRNA] viruses carry at infection an RNA replicase that makes multiple translation-competent copies of the incoming viral genome, we reasoned that (+)ssRNA viruses will be more sensitive to the effect of Slfn11 on protein synthesis than (−)ssRNA viruses. To evaluate this hypothesis, we tested the effects of Slfn11 on the replication of a panel of ssRNA viruses in the human glioblastoma cell line A172, which naturally expresses Slfn11. Depletion of Slfn11 significantly increased the replication of (+)ssRNA viruses from the Flavivirus genus, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), but had no significant effect on the replication of the (−)ssRNA viruses vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Rhabdoviridae family) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (Phenuiviridae family). Quantification of the ratio of genome-containing viral particles to PFU indicated that Slfn11 impairs WNV infectivity. Intriguingly, Slfn11 prevented WNV-induced downregulation of a subset of tRNAs implicated in the translation of 11.8% of the viral polyprotein. Low-abundance tRNAs might promote optimal protein folding and enhance viral infectivity, as previously reported. In summary, this study demonstrates that Slfn11 restricts flavivirus replication by impairing viral infectivity. IMPORTANCE We provide evidence that the cellular protein Schlafen 11 (Slfn11) impairs replication of flaviviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). However, replication of single-stranded negative RNA viruses was not affected. Specifically, Slfn11 decreases the infectivity of WNV potentially by preventing virus-induced modifications of the host tRNA repertoire that could lead to enhanced viral protein folding.

AB  - Dengue virus nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) is a membrane protein consisting of 248 residues with a crucial role in virus replication and interference with the host innate immunity. The dengue virus serotype 3 NS4B was reconstituted into lyso-myristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (LMPG) micelles. Backbone resonance assignment of NS4B was obtained using conventional solution NMR experiments. Further studies suggested that NS4B contained eleven helices and six of them form five potential transmembrane regions. This study provides atomic level information for an important drug target to control flavivirus infections.

SP  - 3291
EP  - 6
AB  - Several studies have generated computer-based predictions of secondary structure of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of Dengue virus (DEN); however, experimental verification of the formation of these structures in vitro is lacking. This study assessed the congruence of Mfold predictions of secondary structure of the core region of the DEN type 4 3' UTR with nuclease maps of this region. Maps and predictions were largely consistent. Maps supported the existence of previously predicted pseudoknots and identified putative regions of dynamic folding. Additionally, this study investigated previously identified conserved elements in the flavivirus 3' UTR that differ among viruses with different modes of transmission. Specific regions of mosquito-borne DEN type 4 were either deleted or replaced with homologous sequences from tick-borne Langat virus. All of these mutations caused substantial distortion of secondary structure, yet viruses carrying these mutations were viable.

JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 197
SP  - 4053
EP  - 4065
AB  - Flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a unique secreted nonstructural glycoprotein. Although it is absent from the flavivirus virion, intracellular and extracellular forms of NS1 have essential roles in viral replication and the pathogenesis of infection. The fate of NS1 in insect cells has been more controversial, with some reports suggesting it is exclusively cell associated. In this study, we confirm NS1 secretion from cells of insect origin and characterize its physical, biochemical, and functional properties in the context of dengue virus (DENV) infection. Unlike mammalian cell–derived NS1, which displays both high mannose and complex type N-linked glycans, soluble NS1 secreted from DENV-infected insect cells contains only high mannose glycans. Insect cell–derived secreted NS1 also has different physical properties, including smaller and more heterogeneous sizes and the formation of less stable NS1 hexamers. Both mammalian and insect cell–derived NS1 bind to complement proteins C1s, C4, and C4-binding protein, as well as to a novel partner, mannose-binding lectin. Binding of NS1 to MBL protects DENV against mannose-binding lectin–mediated neutralization by the lectin pathway of complement activation. As we detected secreted NS1 and DENV together in the saliva of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, these findings suggest a mechanism of viral immune evasion at the very earliest phase of infection.

TI  - Secreted NS1 of Dengue Virus Attaches to the Surface of Cells via Interactions with Heparan Sulfate and Chondroitin Sulfate E
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 3
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein-1 (NS1) is a secreted glycoprotein that is absent from viral particles but accumulates in the supernatant and on the plasma membrane of cells during infection. Immune recognition of cell surface NS1 on endothelial cells has been hypothesized as a mechanism for the vascular leakage that occurs during severe DENV infection. However, it has remained unclear how NS1 becomes associated with the plasma membrane, as it contains no membrane-spanning sequence motif. Using flow cytometric and ELISA-based binding assays and mutant cell lines lacking selective glycosaminoglycans, we show that soluble NS1 binds back to the surface of uninfected cells primarily via interactions with heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate E. DENV NS1 binds directly to the surface of many types of epithelial and mesenchymal cells yet attaches poorly to most peripheral blood cells. Moreover, DENV NS1 preferentially binds to cultured human microvascular compared to aortic or umbilical cord vein endothelial cells. This binding specificity was confirmed in situ as DENV NS1 bound to lung and liver but not intestine or brain endothelium of mouse tissues. Differential binding of soluble NS1 by tissue endothelium and subsequent recognition by anti-NS1 antibodies could contribute to the selective vascular leakage syndrome that occurs during severe secondary DENV infection.

TI  - Secreted dengue virus NS1 from infection is predominantly dimeric and in complex with high-density lipoprotein
AB  - Severe dengue infections are characterized by endothelial dysfunction shown to be associated with the secreted nonstructural protein 1 (sNS1), making it an attractive vaccine antigen and biotherapeutic target. To uncover the biologically relevant structure of sNS1, we obtained infection-derived sNS1 (isNS1) from DENV-infected Vero cells through immunoffinity purification instead of recombinant sNS1 (rsNS1) overexpressed in insect or mammalian cell lines. We found that isNS1 appeared as an approximately 250 kDa complex of NS1 and ApoA1 and further determined the cryoEM structures of isNS1 and its complex with a monoclonal antibody/Fab. Indeed, we found that the major species of isNS1 is a complex of the NS1 dimer partially embedded in a High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) particle. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) studies confirmed that the isNS1 interacts with the major HDL component ApoA1 through interactions that map to the NS1 wing and hydrophobic domains. Furthermore, our studies demonstrated that the sNS1 in sera from DENV-infected mice and a human patient form a similar complex as isNS1. Our results report the molecular architecture of a biological form of sNS1 which may have implications for the molecular pathogenesis of dengue. Summary CryoEM structures of secreted dengue virus NS1 protein reveal dimers in complex with high-density lipoprotein.

VL  - 108

EP  - 8008
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes the major arboviral disease of the tropics, characterized in its severe forms by signs of hemorrhage and plasma leakage. DENV encodes a nonstructural glycoprotein, NS1, that associates with intracellular membranes and the cell surface. NS1 is eventually secreted as a soluble hexamer from DENV-infected cells and circulates in the bloodstream of infected patients. Extracellular NS1 has been shown to modulate the complement system and to enhance DENV infection, yet its structure and function remain essentially unknown. By combining cryoelectron microscopy analysis with a characterization of NS1 amphipathic properties, we show that the secreted NS1 hexamer forms a lipoprotein particle with an open-barrel protein shell and a prominent central channel rich in lipids. Biochemical and NMR analyses of the NS1 lipid cargo reveal the presence of triglycerides, bound at an equimolar ratio to the NS1 protomer, as well as cholesteryl esters and phospholipids, a composition evocative of the plasma lipoproteins involved in vascular homeostasis. This study suggests that DENV NS1, by mimicking or hijacking lipid metabolic pathways, contributes to endothelium dysfunction, a key feature of severe dengue disease.

TI  - Secretion of Galectin-9 as a DAMP during Dengue Virus Infection in THP-1 Cells
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 18
AB  - Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are endogenous cellular molecules released to the extracellular environment in response to stress conditions such as virus infection. Galectins are β-galactoside-binding proteins that are widely expressed in cells and tissues of the immune system, are localized in the cell cytoplasm, and have roles in inflammatory responses and immune responses against infection. Elevated levels of galectin-9 (Gal-9) in natural human infections have been documented in numerous reports. To investigate the effect of dengue virus (DENV) infection on expression of endogenous Gal-9, monocytic THP-1 cells were infected with varying doses of DENV-3 (multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.01, 0.03 and 0.1) and incubated at varying time points (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3). Results showed augmentation of Gal-9 levels in the supernatant, reduction of Gal-9 levels in the cells and decreased expression of LGALS9 mRNA, while DENV-3 mRNA copies for all three doses remained stable through time. Dengue virus induced the secretion of Gal-9 as a danger response; in turn, Gal-9 and other inflammatory factors, and stimulated effector responses may have limited further viral replication. The results in this pilot experiment add to the evidence of Gal-9 as a potential DAMP.

TI  - Secretion of Nonstructural Protein 1 of Dengue Virus from Infected Mosquito Cells: Facts and Speculations
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 92
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional glycoprotein. For decades, the notion in the field was that NS1 is secreted exclusively from vertebrate cells and not from mosquito cells. However, recent evidence shows that mosquito cells also secrete NS1 efficiently. In this review, we discuss the evidence for secretion of NS1 of dengue virus, and of other flaviviruses, from mosquito cells, differences between NS1 secreted from mosquito and NS1 secreted from vertebrate cells, and possible roles of soluble NS1 in the insect flavivirus vector.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is currently among the most important human pathogens and affects millions of people throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Although it has been a World Health Organization priority for several years, there is still no efficient vaccine available to prevent infection. The envelope glycoprotein (E), exposed on the surface on infective viral particles, is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. For this reason it has been used as the antigen of choice for vaccine development efforts. Here we show a detailed analysis of factors involved in the expression, secretion and folding of E ectodomain from all four DENV serotypes in mammalian cells, and how this affects their ability to induce neutralizing antibody responses in DNA-vaccinated mice. Proper folding of E domain II (DII) is essential for efficient E ectodomain secretion, with DIII playing a significant role in stabilizing soluble dimers. We also show that the level of protein secreted from transfected cells determines the strength and efficiency of antibody responses in the context of DNA vaccination and should be considered a pivotal feature for the development of E-based DNA vaccines against DENV.

JF  - Novartis Foundation symposium
VL  - 277

EP  - 47;discussion247-53
AB  - Flaviviruses are major arthropod-borne human pathogens responsible for life-threatening encephalitis, hepatitis and haemorrhagic fevers. These enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses encode a polyprotein precursor of about 3400 amino acids, processed into three structural and seven non-structural proteins. The non-structural glycoprotein NS1 is essential for flavivirus viability. During host-cell infection in vitro, NS1 is found associated with intracellular organelles as a requisite for its role in viral replication, or is transported to the cell surface where it may trigger specific signalling pathways. In addition, a secreted form of the protein is released from flavivirus-infected mammalian cells. We have previously shown that the NS1 protein circulates during the acute phase of the disease in the plasma of patients infected with dengue virus type 1 and have extended our retrospective studies to dengue type 2 and type 3 cohorts, confirming the value of the NS1 antigen as an alternative diagnostic marker. Interestingly, detection of the NS1 protein in yellow fever virus and West Nile virus infections suggests that NS1 secretion is a hallmark of human flavivirus infections. The objectives of our current studies are to define the biological properties of the secreted form of the NS1 protein, to evaluate its possible contribution to viral pathogenesis, and to validate this protein as a candidate target for passive immunoprophylaxis against flaviviruses.

TI  - Secretory glycoprotein NS1 plays a crucial role in the particle formation of flaviviruses
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 18
AB  - Flaviviruses, which are globally distributed and cause a spectrum of potentially severe illnesses, pose a major threat to public health. Although Flaviviridae viruses, including flaviviruses, possess similar genome structures, only the flaviviruses encode the non-structural protein NS1, which resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is secreted from cells after oligomerization. The ER-resident NS1 is known to be involved in viral genome replication, but the essential roles of secretory NS1 in the virus life cycle are not fully understood. Here we characterized the roles of secretory NS1 in the particle formation of flaviviruses. We first identified an amino acid residue essential for the NS1 secretion but not for viral genome replication by using protein-protein interaction network analyses and mutagenesis scanning. By using the recombinant flaviviruses carrying the identified NS1 mutation, we clarified that the mutant flaviviruses employed viral genome replication. We then constructed a recombinant NS1 with the identified mutation and demonstrated by physicochemical assays that the mutant NS1 was unable to form a proper oligomer or associate with liposomes. Finally, we showed that the functions of NS1 that were lost by the identified mutation could be compensated for by the in trans-expression of Erns of pestiviruses and host exchangeable apolipoproteins, which participate in the infectious particle formation of pestiviruses and hepaciviruses in the family Flaviviridae, respectively. Collectively, our study suggests that secretory NS1 plays a role in the particle formation of flaviviruses through its interaction with the lipid membrane.

TI  - Secretory pathways and multiple functions of nonstructural protein 1 in flavivirus infection
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 14
AB  - The genus Flavivirus contains a wide variety of viruses that cause severe disease in humans, including dengue virus, yellow fever virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a glycoprotein that encodes a 352-amino-acid polypeptide and has a molecular weight of 46–55 kDa depending on its glycosylation status. NS1 is highly conserved among multiple flaviviruses and occurs in distinct forms, including a dimeric form within the endoplasmic reticulum, a cell-associated form on the plasma membrane, or a secreted hexameric form (sNS1) trafficked to the extracellular matrix. Intracellular dimeric NS1 interacts with other NSs to participate in viral replication and virion maturation, while extracellular sNS1 plays a critical role in immune evasion, flavivirus pathogenesis and interactions with natural vectors. In this review, we provide an overview of recent research progress on flavivirus NS1, including research on the structural details, the secretory pathways in mammalian and mosquito cells and the multiple functions in viral replication, immune evasion, pathogenesis and interaction with natural hosts, drawing together the previous data to determine the properties of this protein.

TI  - Selective Susceptibility of Human Skin Antigen Presenting Cells to Productive Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue is a growing global concern with 390 million people infected each year. Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted by mosquitoes, thus host cells in the skin are the first point of contact with the virus. Human skin contains several populations of antigen-presenting cells which could drive the immune response to DENV in vivo: epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs), three populations of dermal dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages. Using samples of normal human skin we detected productive infection of CD14+ and CD1c+ DCs, LCs and dermal macrophages, which was independent of DC-SIGN expression. LCs produced the highest viral titers and were less sensitive to IFN-β. Nanostring gene expression data showed significant up-regulation of IFN-β, STAT-1 and CCL5 upon viral exposure in susceptible DC populations. In mice infected intra-dermally with DENV we detected parallel populations of infected DCs originating from the dermis and migrating to the skin-draining lymph nodes. Therefore dermal DCs may simultaneously facilitate systemic spread of DENV and initiate the adaptive anti-viral immune response.

TI  - Selective Tropism of Dengue Virus for Human Glycoprotein Ib
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 8
AB  - Since the hemorrhage in severe dengue seems to be primarily related to the defect of the platelet, the possibility that dengue virus (DENV) is selectively tropic for one of its surface receptors was investigated. Flow cytometric data of DENV-infected megakaryocytic cell line superficially expressing human glycoprotein Ib (CD42b) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (CD41 and CD41a) were analyzed by our custom-written software in MATLAB. In two-dimensional analyses, intracellular DENV was detected in CD42b+, CD41+ and CD41a+ cells. In three-dimensional analyses, the DENV was exclusively detected in CD42b+ cells but not in CD42b− cells regardless of the other expressions. In single-cell virus-protein analyses, the amount of DENV was directly correlated with those of CD42b at the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9. Moreover, RT- PCR and apoptosis assays showed that DENV was able to replicate itself and release its new progeny from the infected CD42b+ cells and eventually killed those cells. These results provide evidence for the involvement of CD42b in DENV infection.

TI  - Self-association features of NS1 proteins from different flaviviruses
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Flaviviruses comprise a large group of arboviral species that are distributed in several countries of the tropics, neotropics, and some temperate zones. Since they can produce neurological pathologies or vascular damage, there has been intense research seeking better diagnosis and treatments for their infections in the last decades. The flavivirus NS1 protein is a relevant clinical target because it is involved in viral replication, immune evasion, and virulence. Being a key factor in endothelial and tissue-specific modulation, NS1 has been largely studied to understand the molecular mechanisms exploited by the virus to reprogram host cells. A central part of the viral maturation processes is the NS1 oligomerization because many stages rely on these protein-protein assemblies. In the present study, the self-associations of NS1 proteins from Zika, Dengue, and West Nile viruses are examined through constant-pH coarse-grained biophysical simulations. Free energies of interactions were estimated for different oligomeric states and pH conditions. Our results show that these proteins can form both dimers and tetramers under conditions near physiological pH even without the presence of lipids. Moreover, pH plays an important role mainly controlling the regimes where van der Waals interactions govern their association. Finally, despite the similarity at the sequence level, we found that each flavivirus has a well-characteristic protein-protein interaction profile. These specific features can provide new hints for the development of binders both for better diagnostic tools and the formulation of new therapeutic drugs.

TI  - Senescence Affects Endothelial Cells Susceptibility to Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - International Journal of Medical Sciences
VL  - 11
SP  - 538
EP  - 544
AB  - Alteration in the endothelium leading to increased vascular permeability contributes to plasma leakage seen in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). An earlier study showed that senescent endothelial cells (ECs) altered the ECs permeability. Here we investigated the susceptibility of senescing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to dengue virus infection and determined if dengue virus infection induces HUVECs senescence. Our results suggest that DENV type-2 (DENV-2) foci forming unit (FFU) and extracellular virus RNA copy number were reduced by at least 35% and 85% in infection of the intermediate young and early senescent HUVECs, respectively, in comparison to infection of young HUVECs. No to low infectivity was recovered from infection of late senescent HUVECs. DENV infection also increases the percentage of HUVECs expressing senescence-associated (SA)-β-gal, cells arrested at the G2/M phase or 4N DNA content stage and cells with enlarged morphology, indicative of senescing cells. Alteration of HUVECs morphology was recorded using impedance-based real-time cell analysis system following DENV-2 infection. These results suggest that senescing HUVECs do not support DENV infection and DENV infection induces HUVECs senescence. The finding highlights the possible role of induction of senescence in DENV infection of the endothelial cells.

TI  - Senescence in Monocytes Facilitates Dengue Virus Infection by Increasing Infectivity
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Aging and chronic condition increase the incidence of dengue virus (DENV) infection, generally through a mechanism involving immunosenescence; however, the alternative effects of cellular senescence, which alters cell susceptibility to viral infection, remain unknown. Human monocytic THP-1 cells (ATCC TIB-202) treated with D-galactose to induce cellular senescence were susceptible to DENV infection. These senescent cells showed increased viral entry/binding, gene/protein expression, and dsRNA replication. The use of a replicon system showed that pharmacologically induced senescence did not enhance the effects on viral protein translation. By examining viral receptor expression, we found increased expression of CD209 (DC-SIGN) in the senescent cells. Interleukin (IL)-10 was aberrantly produced at high levels by the senescent cells, and the expression of the DENV receptor DC-SIGN was increased in these senescent cells, partially via IL-10-mediated regulation of the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. The results demonstrate that a senescent phenotype facilitates DENV infection, probably by increasing DC-SIGN expression.

TI  - Sensing of Immature Particles Produced by Dengue Virus Infected Cells Induces an Antiviral Response by Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the leading cause of mosquito-borne viral illness and death in humans. Like many viruses, DENV has evolved potent mechanisms that abolish the antiviral response within infected cells. Nevertheless, several in vivo studies have demonstrated a key role of the innate immune response in controlling DENV infection and disease progression. Here, we report that sensing of DENV infected cells by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) triggers a robust TLR7-dependent production of IFNα, concomitant with additional antiviral responses, including inflammatory cytokine secretion and pDC maturation. We demonstrate that unlike the efficient cell-free transmission of viral infectivity, pDC activation depends on cell-to-cell contact, a feature observed for various cell types and primary cells infected by DENV, as well as West Nile virus, another member of the Flavivirus genus. We show that the sensing of DENV infected cells by pDCs requires viral envelope protein-dependent secretion and transmission of viral RNA. Consistently with the cell-to-cell sensing-dependent pDC activation, we found that DENV structural components are clustered at the interface between pDCs and infected cells. The actin cytoskeleton is pivotal for both this clustering at the contacts and pDC activation, suggesting that this structural network likely contributes to the transmission of viral components to the pDCs. Due to an evolutionarily conserved suboptimal cleavage of the precursor membrane protein (prM), DENV infected cells release uncleaved prM containing-immature particles, which are deficient for membrane fusion function. We demonstrate that cells releasing immature particles trigger pDC IFN response more potently than cells producing fusion-competent mature virus. Altogether, our results imply that immature particles, as a carrier to endolysosome-localized TLR7 sensor, may contribute to regulate the progression of dengue disease by eliciting a strong innate response.

TI  - Sequential production of cytokines by dengue virus‐infected human peripheral blood leukocyte cultures
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 59
AB  - The study was undertaken to elucidate the sequence of appearance of T helper (Th)1‐ and Th2‐type cytokines in human peripheral blood leucocyte cultures infected in vitro with dengue type 2 virus. Commercial sandwich enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay kits were used to assay the levels of tumour necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α), interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ), interleukin (IL)‐2, IL‐4, IL‐5, IL‐6, and IL‐10 in culture supernatants. Culture supernatants were also screened for the cytotoxic factor and the dengue virus titres determined. The cytokines that appeared in the culture supernatants on the first day post‐infection (p.i.) were cytotoxic factor, TNF‐α, IL‐2, and IL‐6; their levels were highest on the second day p.i. IFN‐γ appeared on the second day with a peak on the third day p.i. The levels of these cytokines declined quickly, except for human cytotoxic factor (hCF) and IL‐2. The cytokines that appeared later were IL‐10 and IL‐5 on the fourth day and IL‐4 on the sixth day p.i. Dengue virus replicated in the peripheral blood leucocyte (PBL) cultures and was present throughout the course of the study. The findings of the present study show that dengue virus induced a predominant Th1‐type cytokine response during the first 3 days of infection of PBL cultures that was replaced by a Th2‐type response later.

TI  - Serotype-Specific Entry of Dengue Virus into Liver Cells: Identification of the 37-Kilodalton/67-Kilodalton High-Affinity Laminin Receptor as a Dengue Virus Serotype 1 Receptor
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 12647
EP  - 12656
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus, the causative agent of dengue fever, dengue shock syndrome, and dengue hemorrhagic fever, infects susceptible cells by initially binding to a receptor(s) located on the host cell surface. Evidence to date suggests that receptor usage may be cell and serotype specific, and this study sought to identify dengue virus serotype 1 binding proteins on the surface of liver cells, a known target organ. By using a virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA), in both nondenaturing and denaturing gel systems, a putative dengue virus serotype 1 binding protein of approximately 37 kDa expressed on the surface of liver (HepG2) cells was identified. Mass spectrometry analysis identified a candidate protein, the 37/67-kDa high-affinity laminin receptor. Entry of the dengue virus serotype 1 was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by both antibodies directed against the 37/67-kDa high-affinity laminin receptor and soluble laminin. No inhibition of virus entry was seen with dengue virus serotypes 2, 3, or 4, demonstrating that the 37/67-kDa high-affinity laminin receptor is a serotype-specific receptor for dengue virus entry into liver cells.

TI  - Serratia odorifera a Midgut Inhabitant of Aedes aegypti Mosquito Enhances Its Susceptibility to Dengue-2 Virus
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Mosquito midgut plays a crucial role in its vector susceptibility and pathogen interaction. Identification of the sustainable microflora of the midgut environment can therefore help in evaluating its contribution in mosquito-pathogen interaction and in turn vector competence. To understand the bacterial diversity in the midgut of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, we conducted a screening study of the gut microbes of these mosquitoes which were either collected from fields or reared in the laboratory “culture-dependent” approach. This work demonstrated that the microbial flora of larvae and adult Ae. aegypti midgut is complex and is dominated by Gram negative proteobacteria. Serratia odorifera was found to be stably associated in the midguts of field collected and laboratory reared larvae and adult females. The potential influence of this sustainable gut microbe on DENV-2 susceptibility of this vector was evaluated by co-feeding S. odorifera with DENV-2 to adult Ae. aegypti females (free of gut flora). The observations revealed that the viral susceptibility of these Aedes females enhanced significantly as compared to solely dengue-2 fed and another gut inhabitant, Microbacterium oxydans co-fed females. Based on the results of this study we proposed that the enhancement in the DENV-2 susceptibility of Ae. aegypti females was due to blocking of prohibitin molecule present on the midgut surface of these females by the polypeptide of gut inhabitant S. odorifera.

TI  - Severe Dengue Is Associated with Consumption of von Willebrand Factor and Its Cleaving Enzyme ADAMTS-13
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 6
AB  - Background Thrombocytopenia, bleeding and plasma leakage are cardinal features of severe dengue. Endothelial cell activation with exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) may play an etiological role in this condition. Methods and Principal Findings In a cohort of 73 Indonesian children with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), of which 30 with dengue shock syndrome (DSS), we measured plasma levels of the WPB constituents von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF propeptide and osteoprotegerin (OPG), together with activity levels of the VWF-cleaving enzyme ADAMTS-13 and the amount of VWF in a platelet binding conformation (VWF activation factor). Compared with healthy controls (n = 17), children with DHF/DSS had significantly higher levels of VWF:Ag, VWF propeptide and OPG and decreased ADAMTS-13 activity. The VWF activation factor was also significantly higher in DHF/DSS and highest in children who died. There were significant differences in the kinetics of the various WPB constituents: VWF propeptide and OPG levels decreased toward discharge, while VWF:Ag levels were lower than expected at enrollment with plasma levels increasing toward discharge. Moreover, VWF propeptide levels correlated better with markers of disease severity (platelet count, liver enzymes, serum albumin and pleural effusion index) than corresponding VWF levels. Together, these findings suggest that there is consumption of VWF in DHF/DSS. In 4 out of 15 selected children with low ADAMTS-13 levels on admission, we found a remarkable reduction in the large and intermediate VWF multimers in the discharge blood samples, consistent with an acquired von Willebrand disease. Conclusion These findings suggest that severe dengue is associated with exocytosis of WPBs with increased circulating levels of VWF:Ag, VWF propeptide and OPG. High circulating levels of VWF in its active conformation, together with low ADAMTS-13 activity levels, are likely to contribute to the thrombocytopenia and complications of dengue. During the convalescence phase, qualitative defects in VWF with loss of larger VWF multimers may develop.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction Two billion population are at risk of dengue fever and by 2080, over six billion population will be at risk. Hepatitis is common in dengue and the liver is invariably involved in severe cases. We conducted a literature review using the PubMed database on articles covering a broad range of issues related to dengue and hepatitis. Areas covered This article overviews available literature on changes in the definition of severe dengue, pathogenesis of liver involvement in dengue, clinical manifestations, and predictors of mortality in severe dengue with liver involvement, impact of viral hepatitis co-infections and hepatotoxic drugs, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Expert commentary Hepatitis is commonly seen in dengue however the degree of elevation of transaminases did not correlate well with severity of illness in observational studies, except in the elderly. The underlying pathogenesis of liver injury is still being elucidated and further studies are required to fully understand the cellular pathways. Acute or chronic viral hepatitis does not appear to affect dengue outcomes. Commonly used medications such as paracetamol and statins may influence dengue outcomes.

VL  - 13
AB  - DEAR EDITOR, Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne flavivirus infection in humans with 3.9 billion people at risk of infection and 70% of the disease burden is in Asia.1,2 The four serologically and genetically distinct Dengue viruses (DENV1-4) can cause mild flu-like symptoms to lifethreatening disease involving vascular leakage and thrombocytopenia which can lead to shock and organ failure. Our study was designed to identify biomarkers of severe dengue by quantitative proteomics based on isobaric Tag for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) labelling of plasma samples obtained from four different disease severity conditions: convalescent (CONV; n = 5), mild dengue/dengue illness (DI; n = 5), severe dengue without fluid leak (SD No FL; n = 5) and severe dengue with fluid leak (SD with FL; n = 5). The samples were divided into five sets for 4-plex iTRAQ labelling with each set consisting of all the four disease conditions (Figure S1 and Table S1). The distribution of peptide counts obtained across proteins that are differentially regulated in dengue infection is shown (Figure S2). Ninety-six proteins identified in DI, 101 in SD and 104 in SD with FL, respectively, are represented using Venn diagram to identify proteins unique to each of the three clinical symptoms (Figure 1A). We selected 54 proteins, which were identified in at least two out of the five iTRAQ runs (Dataset S1) and the expression levels of these proteins in dengue samples relative to convalescent samples were depicted in a heat map (Figure 1B). Network analysis was performed by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins to predict interactions (both direct and indirect/functional) among the differentially expressed proteins (Figure 1C). A subset of identified proteins clustered into two prominent functional network namely the plasma lipid transport and complement pathways.

VL  - 37 2
SP  - 398

AB  - Male Aedes albopictus experimentally infected with dengue virus types 1, 2, 3, or 4 transmitted their infection sexually to female Ae. albopictus. Such transmission was enhanced if the females had taken a bloodmeal 2 to 7 days prior to mating. Male Ae. albopictus also transmitted dengue virus vertically to their F1 progeny. Infected progeny were found among those derived from eggs laid greater than or equal to 73 hr after mating but not among those derived from eggs laid prior to that time. This suggests that virus probably was not transmitted directly to ova but, rather, underwent prior replication in the female genital tract. Female Ae. albopictus experimentally infected with dengue type 1 virus did not transmit their infection sexually to males. This finding supports the hypothesis that male mosquitoes naturally infected with dengue virus acquired their infection vertically.

TI  - Sialic Acid Expression in the Mosquito Aedes aegypti and Its Possible Role in Dengue Virus-Vector Interactions
JF  - BioMed Research International
VL  - 2015
AB  - Dengue fever (DF) is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease which affects humans. DF is caused by the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes, which are transmitted to the host by the mosquito Aedes aegypti that has key roles in DENV infection, replication, and viral transmission (vector competence). Mosquito saliva also plays an important role during DENV transmission. In this study, we detected the presence of sialic acid (Sia) in Aedes aegypti tissues, which may have an important role during DENV-vector competence. We also identified genome sequences encoding enzymes involved in Sia pathways. The cDNA for Aedes aegypti CMP-Sia synthase (CSAS) was amplified, cloned, and functionally evaluated via the complementation of LEC29.Lec32 CSAS-deficient CHO cells. AedesCSAS-transfected LEC29.Lec32 cells were able to express Sia moieties on the cell surface. Sequences related to α-2,6-sialyltransferase were detected in the Aedes aegypti genome. Likewise, we identified Sia-α-2,6-DENV interactions in different mosquito tissues. In addition, we evaluated the possible role of sialylated molecules in a salivary gland extract during DENV internalization in mammalian cells. The knowledge of early DENV-host interactions could facilitate a better understanding of viral tropism and pathogenesis to allow the development of new strategies for controlling DENV transmission.

TI  - Signaling Pathways Involved In Dengue-2 Virus Infection Induced RANTES Overexpression
JF  - American Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 4
SP  - 32
EP  - 40
AB  - Dengue viruses participate in liver inflammation by inducting the expression of various chemokines including Regulated on Activation Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES). However, the underlying signaling remains unknown. Here, we reveal that Ras, Raf-1 and three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), and c-jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) can be activated or phosphorylated in dengue-2 virus infected hepatocyte and epithelial cells by western blotting and confirmed by dominant negative mutants of ras, raf-1, p38, Erk, and JNK. The Tet-off inducible plasmids harboring dengue-2 virus prM, core, E or NS1 gene were utilized to reveal their role in RANTES activation. However, no effect was detected among the genes tested indicating that they are either dispensable or not sufficient for RANTES activation. Taken-together, Ras, Raf-1, JNK, Erk and p38 related signaling pathways are essential for the activation of RANTES by dengue-2 virus. The knowledge gathered will shed light on developing a novel therapeutic approach to block inflammatory infiltrates through decreasing RANTES expression.

TI  - Signaling of Macrophage Inflammatory Protein (MIP)-3β Facilitates Dengue Virus-Induced Microglial Cell Migration
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 10
AB  - The infection by dengue virus (DENV) of microglia causes cell activation and migration via a mechanism involving viral entry, RNA release, and Toll-like receptor 3 signaling. In this study, we demonstrated that secreted chemotactic factors present in microglial conditioned medium (MCM) facilitated cell motility in the murine BV2 microglial cells. The pharmacological disruption of lipid rafts/caveolae reduced DENV- and ultraviolet (UV)-inactivated MCM-induced microglial cell migration. An antibody-based cytokine/chemokine array showed an increase in macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3β in MCM produced using DENV-infected cells. The pharmacological inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) retarded UV-MCM-induced microglial cell migration. These results demonstrate that secreted MIP-3β and its effect on the JNK signaling pathways mediates DENV-induced BV2 microglial cell migration.

EP  - 10629
AB  - ABSTRACT Point mutations that resulted in a substitution of the conserved 3′-penultimate cytidine in genomic RNA or the RNA negative strand of the self-amplifying replicon of the Flavivirus Kunjin virus completely blocked in vivo replication. Similarly, substitutions of the conserved 3′-terminal uridine in the RNA negative or positive strand completely blocked replication or caused much-reduced replication, respectively. The same preference for cytidine in the 3′-terminal dinucleotide was noted in reports of the in vitro activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for the other genera of Flaviviridae that also employ a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) template to initiate asymmetric semiconservative RNA positive-strand synthesis. The Kunjin virus replicon results were interpreted in the context of a proposed model for initiation of RNA synthesis based on the solved crystal structure of the RdRp of φ6 bacteriophage, which also replicates efficiently using a dsRNA template with conserved 3′-penultimate cytidines and a 3′-terminal pyrimidine. A previously untested substitution of the conserved pentanucleotide at the top of the 3′-terminal stem-loop of all Flavivirus species also blocked detectable in vivo replication of the Kunjin virus replicon RNA.

TI  - Similarities and differences between the ‘cytokine storms’ in acute dengue and COVID-19
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 10
AB  - Severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction in COVID-19 and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) are two diseases that can associate with an altered immune response to the infecting virus. To determine the similarities and differences in the cytokine and chemokine responses in these two infections, we compared responses in patients with varying severity of COVID-19 and acute dengue at different time points of illness. During early disease, patients who proceeded to develop COVID-19 severe pneumonia (SP) and DHF had significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-10 and MIP3α than those who developed mild illness. The lowest levels of IFNγ in early illness were seen in those who succumbed to their illness due to COVID-19. Levels of serum IL-10 (p = 0.0001), IL-6 (p = 0.002), MIP-3α (p = 0.02) and CD40-L levels (p = 0.002) significantly increased from 5 to 9 day of illness to 10–21 day of illness in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, but not in those with mild illness. In contrast, these cytokine/chemokine levels remained unchanged in those with DHF or dengue fever (DF) during febrile and critical phases. Although IL-10 levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with SP, patients with DHF had 25-fold higher levels, whereas IL-6 levels were 11-fold higher in those with COVID-19 SP. IL-10 and other cytokines were evaluated in a larger cohort of patients during early illness (≤ 4 days) who proceeded to develop DF (n = 71) or DHF (n = 64). Of the cytokines evaluated, IL-10 was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in those who went on to develop DHF compared to DF. Low IFNγ response to the SARS-CoV2 and high levels of immunosuppressive IL-10 in both COVID-19 and dengue during early illness are indicators of an altered antiviral response potentially contributing to disease severity.

Mosquitoes were highly resistant to challenge with homologous DEN viruses from which the effector sequences were derived, and resistance to DEN viruses was independent of the orientation of the effector RNA. dsSIN viruses designed to express RNA derived from the premembrane coding region of DEN‐2 prevented the accumulation of DEN2 RNA, and C6/36 cells were highly resistant to DEN‐2 virus when challenged at 2, 5 or 8 days after the initial dsSIN virus infections, even though the dsSIN‐derived RNA had sharply declined at the later time points. Initiation of resistance occurred prior to or within the first 8 h after challenge with DEN‐2 virus. We conclude that DEN viruses are inhibited by a mechanism similar to post‐transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or RNA interference (RNAi) phenomena described in plants and invertebrates, respectively. The potential occurrence of PTGS or RNAi in mosquitoes and mosquito cells suggests new ways of inhibiting the replication of arthropod‐borne viruses in mosquito vectors, studying vector–virus interactions, and silencing endogenous mosquito genes.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) has a considerable impact on the global health and is known to cause morbidity and mortality every year. By passaging DENV2 in baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells, we isolated a mutant clone of DENV2 that shows rapid cytopathic effects in BHK-21 cells as compared with that showed by the parent strain. To investigate the relationship between amino acid mutations and proliferation activity of the isolated DENV2 clone, we performed full genome sequencing and identified 3 amino acid mutations in the coding region, the envelope T120K, NS4A M85T, and NS4B G124A. Genetically modified recombinant DENV2 (rDENV2) carrying the NS4A M85T and NS4B G124A mutations produced higher titers of progeny virus in BHK-21, Vero, and Huh-7 cells than in the wild-type (WT) rDENV2. rDENV2 with mutations at NS4A M85T and NS4B G124A failed to produce any plaques in C6/36 mosquito cell lines. Furthermore, rDENV2 possessing only the NS4B G124A mutation showed no plaque production in C6/36 cells but had higher viral titers in Vero and Huh-7 cells than the WT rDENV2 had. Our results clearly showed that the DENV2 NS4B G124A mutation has opposing effects on the virus proliferation in mosquito and certain mammalian cell lines.

TI  - Single Mutation in the Flavivirus Envelope Protein Hinge Region Increases Neurovirulence for Mice and Monkeys but Decreases Viscerotropism for Monkeys: Relevance to Development and Safety Testing of Live, Attenuated Vaccines
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 76

EP  - 1943
AB  - ABSTRACT A chimeric yellow fever (YF) virus/Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus vaccine (ChimeriVax-JE) was constructed by insertion of the prM-E genes from the attenuated JE virus SA14-14-2 vaccine strain into a full-length cDNA clone of YF 17D virus. Passage in fetal rhesus lung (FRhL) cells led to the emergence of a small-plaque virus containing a single Met→Lys amino acid mutation at E279, reverting this residue from the SA14-14-2 to the wild-type amino acid. A similar virus was also constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (J. Arroyo, F. Guirakhoo, S. Fenner, Z.-X. Zhang, T. P. Monath, and T. J. Chambers, J. Virol. 75:934-942, 2001). The E279 mutation is located in a beta-sheet in the hinge region of the E protein that is responsible for a pH-dependent conformational change during virus penetration from the endosome into the cytoplasm of the infected cell. In independent transfection-passage studies with FRhL or Vero cells, mutations appeared most frequently in hinge 4 (bounded by amino acids E266 to E284), reflecting genomic instability in this functionally important region. The E279 reversion caused a significant increase in neurovirulence as determined by the 50% lethal dose and survival distribution in suckling mice and by histopathology in rhesus monkeys. Based on sensitivity and comparability of results with those for monkeys, the suckling mouse is an appropriate host for safety testing of flavivirus vaccine candidates for neurotropism. After intracerebral inoculation, the E279 Lys virus was restricted with respect to extraneural replication in monkeys, as viremia and antibody levels (markers of viscerotropism) were significantly reduced compared to those for the E279 Met virus. These results are consistent with the observation that empirically derived vaccines developed by mouse brain passage of dengue and YF viruses have increased neurovirulence for mice but reduced viscerotropism for humans.

TI  - Single point mutations in the helicase domain of the NS3 protein enhance dengue virus replicative capacity in human monocyte‐derived dendritic cells and circumvent the type I interferon response
JF  - Clinical & Experimental Immunology
VL  - 183
AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent arboviral disease worldwide. The outcome of the infection is determined by the interplay of viral and host factors. In the present study, we evaluated the cellular response of human monocyte‐derived DCs (mdDCs) infected with recombinant dengue virus type 1 (DV1) strains carrying a single point mutation in the NS3hel protein (L435S or L480S). Both mutated viruses infect and replicate more efficiently and produce more viral progeny in infected mdDCs compared with the parental, non‐mutated virus (vBACDV1). Additionally, global gene expression analysis using cDNA microarrays revealed that the mutated DVs induce the up‐regulation of the interferon (IFN) signalling and pattern recognition receptor (PRR) canonical pathways in mdDCs. Pronounced production of type I IFN were detected specifically in mdDCs infected with DV1‐NS3hel‐mutated virus compared with mdDCs infected with the parental virus. In addition, we showed that the type I IFN produced by mdDCs is able to reduce DV1 infection rates, suggesting that cytokine function is effective but not sufficient to mediate viral clearance of DV1‐NS3hel‐mutated strains. Our results demonstrate that single point mutations in subdomain 2 have important implications for adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of DV1‐NS3hel. Although a direct functional connection between the increased ATPase activity and viral replication still requires further studies, these mutations speed up viral RNA replication and are sufficient to enhance viral replicative capacity in human primary cell infection and circumvent type I IFN activity. This information may have particular relevance for attenuated vaccine protocols designed for DV.

EP  - 623
AB  - Functional immunological evidence supports the impact that the host genetic variability has on the susceptibility to develop asymptomatic or symptomatic dengue infection. Children are more prone to develop severe dengue. Thus, we have evaluated possible associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in immune genes and the development of symptomatic dengue in children from two Colombian populations with differences in genetic backgrounds and geographical features. We genotyped 15 SNPs (in 12 genes) in 298 symptomatic children and 648 healthy controls. Ancestry proportions (APs) were inferred by genotyping 29 ancestry informative markers. We observed four SNPs associated with susceptibility to develop dengue in NOD1, RIPK2, MICB, or PLCE1 genes. Conversely, we found one SNP in TNF gene and two haplotypes in the IKBKE gene associated with resistance to develop dengue. These associations were adjusted by gender, APs, and the population of origin because the association of polymorphisms may be different in admixed populations like Colombian. To our knowledge, this is the first reported association study with dengue in IKBKE, RIPK2, and NOD1 genes. We have also confirmed previously reported associations in MICB and PLCE1 genes with dengue. Overall, our results contribute to the understanding of the genetic susceptibility/resistance to develop symptomatic dengue. Nevertheless, these associations must be validated through functional analysis.

JF  - eLife
VL  - 7
AB  - Dengue and Zika viral infections affect millions of people annually and can be complicated by shock and hemorrhage or neurological manifestations, respectively. Yet, a thorough understanding of the host response to these viruses is still lacking, in part because conventional approaches do not enable one to resolve heterogeneity in viral loads and cellular response between different individual cells. Here we present viscRNA-Seq (virus-inclusive single-cell RNA-Seq), an approach to probe the whole host transcriptome together with intracellular viral RNA at the single cell level that is applicable to both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated viruses. We applied viscRNA-Seq to monitor dynamics of dengue and Zika virus infection in cultured cells and discovered a high heterogeneity of intracellular viral load which affects the virus-triggered host response. The single-cell distributions of both intracellular viral load and gene expression indicate that mean values measured in conventional bulk assays tend to over-represent highly infected cells. When these effects are accounted for, we discovered that several host factors show complex dynamics and a high degree of specificity for either virus. These host factors include both known and novel members of the endoplasmic reticulum translocon and proteins involved in signal peptide processing and intracellular membrane trafficking. We used loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments to validate the viscRNA-Seq hits and discovered novel proviral and antiviral factors. Overall, viscRNA-Seq is a powerful approach to quantitatively assess the complex interplay between virus and host at the single cell level and at a genome-wide scale, and to elucidate the cellular pathways involved in viral infection.

TI  - Single-virus tracking approach to reveal the interaction of Dengue virus with autophagy during the early stage of infection
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Optics
VL  - 19
AB  - Abstract. Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the major infectious pathogens worldwide. DENV infection is a highly dynamic process. Currently, no antiviral drug is available for treating DENV-induced diseases since little is known regarding how the virus interacts with host cells during infection. Advanced molecular imaging technologies are powerful tools to understand the dynamics of intracellular interactions and molecular trafficking. This study exploited a single-virus particle tracking technology to address whether DENV interacts with autophagy machinery during the early stage of infection. Using confocal microscopy and three-dimensional image analysis, we showed that DENV triggered the formation of green fluorescence protein-fused microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) puncta, and DENV-induced autophagosomes engulfed DENV particles within 15-min postinfection. Moreover, single-virus particle tracking revealed that both DENV particles and autophagosomes traveled together during the viral infection. Finally, in the presence of autophagy suppressor 3-methyladenine, the replication of DENV was inhibited and the location of DENV particles spread in cytoplasma. In contrast, the numbers of newly synthesized DENV were elevated and the co-localization of DENV particles and autophagosomes was detected while the cells were treated with autophagy inducer rapamycin. Taken together, we propose that DENV particles interact with autophagosomes at the early stage of viral infection, which promotes the replication of DENV.

AB  - Abstract Background Dengue fever, an acute insect‐borne infectious disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV), poses a great challenge to global public health. Hepatic involvement is the most common complication of severe dengue and is closely related to the occurrence and development of disease. However, the features of adaptive immune responses associated with liver injury in severe dengue are not clear. Methods We used single‐cell sequencing to examine the liver tissues of mild or severe dengue mice model to analyze the changes in immune response of T cells in the liver after dengue virus infection, and the immune interaction between macrophages and T cells. Flow cytometry was used to detect T cells and macrophages in mouse liver and blood to verify the single‐cell sequencing results. Results Our result showed CTLs were significantly activated in the severe liver injury group but the immune function‐related signal pathway was down‐regulated. The reason may be that the excessive immune response in the severe group at the late stage of DENV infection induces the polarization of macrophages into M2 type, and the macrophages then inhibit T cell immunity through the TGF‐β signaling pathway. In addition, the increased proportion of Treg cells suggested that Th17/Treg homeostasis was disrupted in the livers of severe liver injury mice. Conclusions In this study, single‐cell sequencing and flow cytometry revealed the characteristic changes of T cell immune response and the role of macrophages in the liver of severe dengue fever mice. Our study provides a better understanding of the pathogenesis of liver injury in dengue fever patients.

AB  - The pathogenesis of severe dengue remains unclear, particularly the mechanisms underlying the plasma leakage that results in hypovolaemic shock in a small proportion of individuals. Maximal leakage occurs several days after peak viraemia implicating immunological pathways. Skin is a highly vascular organ and also an important site of immune reactions with a high density of dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and T cells. We obtained skin biopsies and contemporaneous blood samples from patients within 24 hours of onset of dengue shock syndrome (DSS), and from healthy controls. We analyzed cell subsets by flow cytometry, and soluble mediators and antibodies by ELISA; the percentage of migratory CD1a+ dermal DCs was significantly decreased in the DSS patients, and skin CD8+ T cells were activated, but there was no accumulation of dengue-specific antibodies. Inflammatory monocytic cells were not observed infiltrating the skin of DSS cases on whole-mount histology, although CD14dim cells disappeared from blood.

Skin is composed of different cell types that together perform essential functions such as pathogen sensing, barrier maintenance and immunity, at once providing the first line of defense against microbial infections and ensuring skin homeostasis. Being inoculated directly through the epidermis and the dermis during a vector blood meal, emerging Dengue, Zika andWest Nile mosquito-borne viruses lead to the initiation of the innate immune response in resident skin cells and to the activation of dendritic cells, which migrate to the draining lymph node to elicit an adaptive response. This literature review aims to describe the inflammatory response and the innate immune signalization pathways involved in human skin cells during Dengue, Zika and West Nile virus infections.

TI  - Small RNA Profiling in Dengue Virus 2-Infected Aedes Mosquito Cells Reveals Viral piRNAs and Novel Host miRNAs
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 10
AB  - In Aedes mosquitoes, infections with arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) trigger or modulate the expression of various classes of viral and host-derived small RNAs, including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs). Viral siRNAs are at the core of the antiviral RNA interference machinery, one of the key pathways that limit virus replication in invertebrates. Besides siRNAs, Aedes mosquitoes and cells derived from these insects produce arbovirus-derived piRNAs, the best studied examples being viruses from the Togaviridae or Bunyaviridae families. Host miRNAs modulate the expression of a large number of genes and their levels may change in response to viral infections. In addition, some viruses, mostly with a DNA genome, express their own miRNAs to regulate host and viral gene expression. Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis of both viral and host-derived small RNAs in Aedes aegypti Aag2 cells infected with dengue virus 2 (DENV), a member of the Flaviviridae family. Aag2 cells are competent in producing all three types of small RNAs and provide a powerful tool to explore the crosstalk between arboviral infection and the distinct RNA silencing pathways. Interestingly, besides the well-characterized DENV-derived siRNAs, a specific population of viral piRNAs was identified in infected Aag2 cells. Knockdown of Piwi5, Ago3 and, to a lesser extent, Piwi6 results in reduction of vpiRNA levels, providing the first genetic evidence that Aedes PIWI proteins produce DENV-derived small RNAs. In contrast, we do not find convincing evidence for the production of virus-derived miRNAs. Neither do we find that host miRNA expression is strongly changed upon DENV2 infection. Finally, our deep-sequencing analyses detect 30 novel Aedes miRNAs, complementing the repertoire of regulatory small RNAs in this important vector species.

AB  - BackgroundSmall RNA (sRNA) regulatory pathways (SRRPs) are important to anti-viral defence in mosquitoes. To identify critical features of the virus infection process in Dengue serotype 2 (DENV2)-infected Ae. aegypti, we deep-sequenced small non-coding RNAs. Triplicate biological replicates were used so that rigorous statistical metrics could be applied.ResultsIn addition to virus-derived siRNAs (20-23 nts) previously reported for other arbovirus-infected mosquitoes, we show that PIWI pathway sRNAs (piRNAs) (24-30 nts) and unusually small RNAs (usRNAs) (13-19 nts) are produced in DENV-infected mosquitoes. We demonstrate that a major catalytic enzyme of the siRNA pathway, Argonaute 2 (Ago2), co-migrates with a ~1 megadalton complex in adults prior to bloodfeeding. sRNAs were cloned and sequenced from Ago2 immunoprecipitations. Viral sRNA patterns change over the course of infection. Host sRNAs were mapped to the published aedine transcriptome and subjected to analysis using edgeR (Bioconductor). We found that sRNA profiles are altered early in DENV2 infection, and mRNA targets from mitochondrial, transcription/translation, and transport functional categories are affected. Moreover, small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as tRNAs, spliceosomal U RNAs, and snoRNAs are highly enriched in DENV-infected samples at 2 and 4 dpi.ConclusionsThese data implicate the PIWI pathway in anti-viral defense. Changes to host sRNA profiles indicate that specific cellular processes are affected during DENV infection, such as mitochondrial function and ncRNA levels. Together, these data provide important progress in understanding the DENV2 infection process in Ae. aegypti.

EVs from infected endothelial cells (EC) may harbor viral segments and various sets of molecules that could contribute to endothelial dysfunction during severe dengue. However, the effect of these EVs on non-infected EC (NIC) remain unknown. We characterized the EVs produced by the human EC line EA.hy 926 infected with DENV-2 and assessed their functional impact on polarized NIC. Results showed that infection induced an increased in the quantity of produced EVs, which differentially carried proteins mainly involved in proteosome activity, along with a peptide of the NS5 viral protein. Additionally, all types of Y-RNAs were found, accompanied by a set of differentially loaded microRNAs (miRs) that could regulate DENV genome. Pre-treatment of polarized NIC with small EVs (sEVs) from infected EC before DENV-2 infection caused EC activation, a decrease in viral genome replication, and a protective effect against barrier disruption during the first 24h post-infection, suggesting that sEVs could be important in the pathology or resolution of DENV and a promising therapeutic tool for infectious diseases.

AB  - BackgroundDengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of Dengue fever and the life-threatening Dengue Haemorrhagic fever or Dengue shock syndrome. In the absence of anti-viral agents or vaccine, there is an urgent need to develop an effective anti-viral strategy against this medically important viral pathogen. The initial interplay between DENV and the host cells may represent one of the potential anti-viral targeting sites. Currently the involvements of human membrane trafficking host genes or factors that mediate the infectious cellular entry of dengue virus are not well defined.ResultsIn this study, we have used a targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) library to identify and profile key cellular genes involved in processes of endocytosis, cytoskeletal dynamics and endosome trafficking that are important and essential for DENV infection. The infectious entry of DENV into Huh7 cells was shown to be potently inhibited by siRNAs targeting genes associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The important role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis was confirmed by the expression of well-characterized dominant-negative mutants of genes in this pathway and by using the clathrin endocytosis inhibitor chlorpromazine. Furthermore, DENV infection was shown to be sensitive to the disruption of human genes in regulating the early to late endosomal trafficking as well as the endosomal acidic pH. The importance and involvement of both actin and microtubule dynamics in mediating the infectious entry of DENV was also revealed in this study.ConclusionsTogether, the findings from this study have provided a detail profiling of the human membrane trafficking cellular genes and the mechanistic insight into the interplay of these host genes with DENV to initiate an infection, hence broadening our understanding on the entry pathway of this medically important viral pathogen. These data may also provide a new potential avenue for development of anti-viral strategies and treatment of DENV infection.

TI  - Soluble NS1 antagonizes IgG- and IgA-mediated monocytic phagocytosis of DENV infected cells
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is endemic in over 100 countries, infecting an estimated 400 million individuals every year. Infection with DENV raises a significant antibody response, primarily consisting of antibodies targeting viral (structural) proteins. However, not all DENV antigens are part of the virion itself, as the DENV genome encodes several non-structural (NS) proteins. One of these, NS1, has been shown to be antigenic and is expressed on the membrane of DENV-infected cells. IgG and IgA isotype antibodies that bind NS1 are detectable in serum following DENV infection and are also capable of interacting with Fc receptors expressed on professional phagocytes. Our study aims to determine if NS1-binding IgG and IgA isotype antibodies contribute to the clearance of DENV-infected cells by professional phagocytes through antibody mediated phagocytosis/trogocytosis. Using an in vitro model of trogocytosis we observed that both IgG and IgA isotype antibodies can facilitate facilitating monocytic uptake of DENV NS1 expressing plasma membrane in an additive fashion. This process was dependent on the expression of FcγRI (CD64) and FcαR (CD89) for IgG and IgA mediated membrane uptake, respectively. Furthermore, this process was antagonized by the presence of soluble NS1, suggesting that the production of soluble NS1 by infected cells may serve as an immunological chaff, thereby antagonizing opsonization and clearance of infected cells by NS1-specific IgG and IgA isotype antibodies.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) produces an acute infection that results in the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines. Although increased levels of the immunoregulator soluble ST2 (sST2) protein have been reported in the serum of patients with dengue, its importance during DENV infection remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a recombinant human sST2 protein on the production of TNF- and IL-6 in an in vitro model of DENV infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were permissive to in vitro DENV infection since viral antigen was detected in CD14

TI  - Solution structure and structural dynamics of envelope protein domain III of mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses.
JF  - Biochemistry
VL  - 43 28
SP  - 9168
EP  - 76
AB  - The mosquito-borne West Nile (WNV) and dengue 2 (DEN2V) viruses and tick-borne Langat (LGTV) and Omsk hemorrhagic fever (OHFV) viruses are arthropod-borne flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus). These viruses are quite similar at both the nucleotide and amino acid level, yet they are very divergent in their biological properties and in the diseases they cause. The objective of this study was to examine the putative receptor-binding domains of the flaviviruses, the envelope (E) protein domain III (D3), which assume very similar structures either as part of the whole envelope protein or as individual entities, and to define the biophysical properties that distinguish among these viruses. Circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were employed to monitor the solution structure of these proteins. While the spectroscopic results found that the D3 from each of these viruses is composed of either beta-sheets or beta-turns, which is consistent with X-ray crystal data for tick-borne encephalitis and dengue viruses, these results reveal that recombinant D3s (rED3s) derived from tick-borne flaviviruses (LGT-rED3 and OHF-rED3) were similar to each other, while those from mosquito-borne flaviviruses (WN-rED3 and DEN-rED3) were similar to each other yet distinct from rED3 of the tick-borne viruses. Protein dynamic studies probed by fluorescence quenching and hydrogen/deuterium exchange found that the rED3s are dynamic entities. The tick-borne proteins again exhibit very similar dynamic properties, which are different from the mosquito-borne proteins. The WN-rED3 is significantly less stable than the other three rED3s. Overall, these differences in biophysical properties correlate with biological properties of these viruses that tick-borne flaviviruses are more stable than mosquito-borne flaviviruses.

TI  - Solution structure of dengue virus capsid protein reveals another fold.
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 101 10
SP  - 3414
EP  - 9
AB  - Dengue virus is responsible for approximately 50-100 million infections, resulting in nearly 24,000 deaths annually. The capsid (C) protein of dengue virus is essential for specific encapsidation of the RNA genome, but little structural information on the C protein is available. We report the solution structure of the 200-residue homodimer of dengue 2 C protein. The structure provides, to our knowledge, the first 3D picture of a flavivirus C protein and identifies a fold that includes a large dimerization surface contributed by two pairs of helices, one of which has characteristics of a coiled-coil. NMR structure determination involved a secondary structure sorting approach to facilitate assignment of the intersubunit nuclear Overhauser effect interactions. The dimer of dengue C protein has an unusually high net charge, and the structure reveals an asymmetric distribution of basic residues over the surface of the protein. Nearly half of the basic residues lie along one face of the dimer. In contrast, the conserved hydrophobic region forms an extensive apolar surface at a dimer interface on the opposite side of the molecule. We propose a model for the interaction of dengue C protein with RNA and the viral membrane that is based on the asymmetric charge distribution of the protein and is consistent with previously reported results.

JF  - Epidemiology and Infection
VL  - 134
SP  - 820
EP  - 825
AB  - IgM- and IgG-capture ELISAs are widely used as diagnostic tests for confirmation of dengue virus infection. The positive rate of anti-dengue IgM and IgG detection was examined in primary and secondary dengue virus infections in the setting of a provincial hospital using IgM- and IgG-capture ELISAs. Disease day 1 was defined as the day of onset of symptoms. In total, 232 plasma samples were collected from 106 confirmed dengue cases consisting of 12 primary and 94 secondary infections. In primary infection, anti-dengue IgM was detected in 4 out of 5 samples collected on disease day 5 and in all the 21 samples collected on disease day 6 or later. Specific IgG was detected in 2 out of 5 samples collected on day 12, and in 5 out of 6 samples collected on disease days 13–15, but was not detected in samples collected on disease day 10 or earlier. In secondary infection, IgM was not detected in the samples on disease days 2 and 3, but detected in 20 out of 79 samples collected on days 4–6, in 44 out of 65 on disease days 7–11 and in 40 out of 51 samples on disease days 12–14. In contrast, specific IgG was detected in 21 out of 60 samples on disease days 4 and 5, in 13 out of 19 on disease day 6, in 62 out of 65 on disease days 7–11 and in all the samples collected on disease day 12 or later. The result indicate that seroconversion rates of IgM and IgG are different between primary and secondary infections, and suggest that detection of specific IgM and IgG is necessary for determining dengue virus infection and for differentiating primary and secondary dengue infections.

TI  - Specific Interaction of DDX6 with an RNA Hairpin in the 3′ UTR of the Dengue Virus Genome Mediates G1 Phase Arrest
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted by mosquitoes to humans, infecting 390 million individuals per year globally. About 20% of infected patients shows a spectrum of clinical manifestation, ranging from a mild flu-like syndrome, to dengue fever, to life-threatening severe dengue diseases, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. ABSTRACT The extent to which viral genomic RNAs interact with host factors and contribute to host response and disease pathogenesis is not well known. Here, we report that the human RNA helicase DDX6 specifically binds to the viral most conserved RNA hairpin in the A3 element in the dengue 3′ UTR, with nanomolar affinities. DDX6 CLIP confirmed the interaction in HuH-7 cells infected by dengue virus serotype 2. This interaction requires three conserved residues—Lys307, Lys367, and Arg369—as well as the unstructured extension in the C-terminal domain of DDX6. Interestingly, alanine substitution of these three basic residues resulted in RNA-independent ATPase activity, suggesting a mechanism by which RNA-binding and ATPase activities are coupled in DEAD box helicases. Furthermore, we applied a cross-omics gene enrichment approach to suggest that DDX6 is functionally related to cell cycle regulation and viral pathogenicity. Indeed, infected cells exhibited cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and a decrease in the early S phase. Exogenous expression of intact DDX6, but not A3-binding-deficient mutants, alleviated these effects by rescue of the DNA preinitiation complex expression. Disruption of the DDX6-binding site was found in dengue and Zika live-attenuated vaccine strains. Our results suggested that dengue virus has evolved an RNA aptamer against DDX6 to alter host cell states and defined DDX6 as a new regulator of G1/S transition. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted by mosquitoes to humans, infecting 390 million individuals per year globally. About 20% of infected patients shows a spectrum of clinical manifestation, ranging from a mild flu-like syndrome, to dengue fever, to life-threatening severe dengue diseases, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. There is currently no specific treatment for dengue diseases, and the molecular mechanism underlying dengue pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In this study, we combined biochemical, bioinformatics, high-content analysis and RNA sequencing approaches to characterize a highly conserved interface of the RNA genome of DENV with a human factor named DDX6 in infected cells. The significance of our research is in identifying the mechanism for a viral strategy to alter host cell fates, which conceivably allows us to generate a model for live-attenuated vaccine and the design of new therapeutic reagent for dengue diseases.

TI  - Specificity of resistance to dengue virus isolates is associated with genotypes of the mosquito antiviral gene Dicer-2
JF  - Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences
VL  - 280
AB  - In contrast to the prevailing view that invertebrate immunity relies on broad-spectrum recognition and effector mechanisms, intrinsic genetic compatibility between invertebrate hosts and their pathogens is often highly specific in nature. Solving this puzzle requires a better understanding of the molecular basis underlying observed patterns of invertebrate host–pathogen genetic specificity, broadly referred to as genotype-by-genotype interactions. Here, we identify an invertebrate immune gene in which natural polymorphism is associated with isolate-specific resistance to an RNA virus. Dicer-2 (dcr2) encodes a key protein upstream of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, a major antiviral component of innate immunity in invertebrates. We surveyed allelic polymorphism at the dcr2 locus in a wild-type outbred population and in three derived isofemale families of the mosquito Aedes aegypti that were experimentally exposed to several, genetically distinct isolates of dengue virus. We found that dcr2 genotype was associated with resistance to dengue virus in a virus isolate-specific manner. By contrast, no such association was found for genotypes at two control loci flanking dcr2, making it likely that dcr2 contains the yet-unidentified causal polymorphism(s). This result supports the idea that host–pathogen compatibility in this system depends, in part, on a genotype-by-genotype interaction between dcr2 and the viral genome, and points to the RNAi pathway as a potentially important determinant of intrinsic insect-virus genetic specificity.

TI  - Sphingosine kinase 1 in viral infections
JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology
VL  - 23
AB  - Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) is an enzyme that phosphorylates the lipid sphingosine to generate sphingosine‐1‐phosphate (S1P). S1P can act intracellularly as a signaling molecule and extracellularly as a receptor ligand. The SphK1/S1P axis has well‐described roles in cell signaling, the cell death/survival decision, the production of a pro‐inflammatory response, immunomodulation, and control of vascular integrity. Agents targeting the SphK1/S1P axis are being actively developed as therapeutics for cancer and immunological and inflammatory disorders. Control of cell death/survival and pro‐inflammatory immune responses is central to the pathology of infectious disease, and we can capitalize on the knowledge provided by investigations of SphK1/S1P in cancer and immunology to assess its application to selected human infections. We have herein reviewed the growing literature relating viral infections to changes in SphK1 and S1P. SphK1 activity is reportedly increased following human cytomegalovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infections, and elevated SphK1 enhances influenza virus infection. In contrast, SphK1 activity is reduced in bovine viral diarrhea virus and dengue virus infections. Sphingosine analogs that modulate S1P receptors have proven useful in animal models in alleviating influenza virus infection but have shown no benefit in simian human immunodeficiency virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections. We have rationalized a role for SphK1/S1P in dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and Ross River virus infections, on the basis of the biology and the pathology of these diseases. The increasing number of effective SphK1 and S1P modulating agents currently in development makes it timely to investigate these roles with the potential for developing modulators of SphK1 and S1P for novel anti‐viral therapies.

TI  - Stability of Dengue 2 Nonstructural Glycoprotein 1 (NS1) Is Affected by the Nature of Basic Residue at Position NS1-324
JF  - Current Issues in Molecular Biology
VL  - 45
SP  - 1644
EP  - 1654
AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease. It is caused by the infection of any of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes DENV-1 to DENV-4. The DENV non-structural glycoprotein 1 (NS1) plays an important role in virus replication and the immunopathogenesis of virus infection. The NS1 protein has been identified as both a cell-associated homodimer and a soluble secreted lipoprotein nanoparticle. The nature of the residues at positions NS1-272 and NS1-324 in the β-ladder domain may have an effect on the biological behaviors of DENV-2 NS1 protein in human hepatoma Huh7 cells. The stability of the NS1 protein from the Reunion 2018 DENV-2 strain was affected by the presence of lysine residues at positions 272 and 324. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of mutations into lysine at positions 272 and 324 on recombinant NS1 protein from the DES-14 DENV-2 strain bearing arginine residue on these two positions. The DES-14 NS1 protein mutant bearing a lysine at position 324 was deficient in protein stability and secretion compared to wild-type protein. The defect in the DES-14 NS1 protein mutant was associated to oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine activation in Huh7 cells. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway might play a key role in the stability of DENV-2 protein bearing a lysine residue at position 324.

TI  - Steady-State NTPase Activity of Dengue Virus NS3: Number of Catalytic Sites, Nucleotide Specificity and Activation by ssRNA
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) unwinds double stranded RNA driven by the free energy derived from the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates. This paper presents the first systematic and quantitative characterization of the steady-state NTPase activity of DENV NS3 and their interaction with ssRNA. Substrate curves for ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP were obtained, and the specificity order for these nucleotides - evaluated as the ratio (kcat/KM)- was GTPATPCTP UTP, which showed that NS3 have poor ability to discriminate between different NTPs. Competition experiments between the four substrates indicated that all of them are hydrolyzed in one and the same catalytic site of the enzyme. The effect of ssRNA on the ATPase activity of NS3 was studied using poly(A) and poly(C). Both RNA molecules produced a 10 fold increase in the turnover rate constant (kcat) and a 100 fold decrease in the apparent affinity (KM) for ATP. When the ratio [RNA bases]/[NS3] was between 0 and 20 the ATPase activity was inhibited by increasing both poly(A) and poly(C). Using the theory of binding of large ligands (NS3) to a one-dimensional homogeneous lattice of infinite length (RNA) we tested the hypothesis that inhibition is the result of crowding of NS3 molecules along the RNA lattices. Finally, we discuss why this hypothesis is consistent with the idea that the ATPase catalytic cycle is tightly coupled to the movement of NS3 helicase along the RNA.

JF  - Protein and peptide letters
VL  - 10 1
SP  - 19
EP  - 26
AB  - The N-terminal part of the NS3 protein from dengue virus contains a trypsin-like serine protease responsible for processing the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein. Enzymatic activity of the NS2B-NS3(pro) precursor incorporating a full-length NS2B cofactor of dengue virus type 2 was examined by using synthetic dodecamer peptide substrates encompassing native cleavage sequences of the NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, NS3/NS4A and NS4B/NS5 polyprotein junctions. Cleavage of the dansylated substrates was monitored by a HPLC-based assay and kinetic parameters for K(1M), k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) were obtained. The data presented here show that NS2B-NS3(pro) expressed in recombinant E. coli can be renatured to an active protease which reacts in the absence of microsomal membranes with all 4 substrate peptides, albeit the molecule does not exhibit autoproteolytic processing at the NS2B/NS3 site. A marked difference in cleavage efficiency was found for the NS2B/NS3 substrate and the remaining 3 peptides based on the NS2A/NS2B, NS3/NS4A and NS4A/NS5 cleavage sites.

TI  - Stearoly-CoA desaturase 1 differentiates early and advanced dengue virus infections and determines virus particle infectivity
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - Positive strand RNA viruses, such as dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) expand and structurally alter ER membranes to optimize cellular communication pathways that promote viral replicative needs. These complex rearrangements require significant protein scaffolding as well as changes to the ER chemical composition to support these structures. We have previously shown that the lipid abundance and repertoire of host cells are significantly altered during infection with these viruses. Specifically, enzymes in the lipid biosynthesis pathway such as fatty acid synthase (FAS) are recruited to viral replication sites by interaction with viral proteins and displayed enhanced activities during infection. We have now identified that events downstream of FAS (fatty acid desaturation) are critical for virus replication. In this study we screened enzymes in the unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) biosynthetic pathway and found that the rate-limiting enzyme in monounsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), is indispensable for DENV2 replication. The enzymatic activity of SCD1, was required for viral genome replication and particle release, and it was regulated in a time-dependent manner with a stringent requirement early during viral infection. As infection progressed, SCD1 protein expression levels were inversely correlated with the concentration of viral dsRNA in the cell. This modulation of SCD1, coinciding with the stage of viral replication, highlighted its function as a trigger of early infection and an enzyme that controlled alternate lipid requirements during early versus advanced infections. Loss of function of this enzyme disrupted structural alterations of assembled viral particles rendering them non-infectious and immature and defective in viral entry. This study identifies the complex involvement of SCD1 in DENV2 infection and demonstrates that these viruses alter ER lipid composition to increase infectivity of the virus particles.

TI  - Sterol Carrier Protein 2, a Critical Host Factor for Dengue Virus Infection, Alters the Cholesterol Distribution in Mosquito Aag2 Cells
VL  - 52
SP  - 1124
EP  - 1134
AB  - ABSTRACT Host factors that enable dengue virus (DENV) to propagate in the mosquito host cells are unclear. It is known that cellular cholesterol plays an important role in the life cycle of DENV in human host cells but unknown if the lipid requirements differ for mosquito versus mammalian. In mosquito Aedes aegypti, sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP-2) is critical for cellular cholesterol homeostasis. In this study, we identified SCP-2 as a critical host factor for DENV production in mosquito Aag2 cells. Treatment with a small molecule commonly referred to as SCPI-1, (N-(4-{[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]amino}phenyl)acetamide hydrobromide, a known inhibitor of SCP-2, or knockdown of SCP-2 dramatically repressed the virus production in mosquito but not mammalian cells. We showed that the intracellular cholesterol distribution in mosquito cells was altered by SCP-2 inhibitor treatment, suggesting that SCP-2-mediated cholesterol trafficking pathway is important for DENV viral production. A comparison of the effect of SCP-2 on mosquito and human cells suggests that SCPI-1 treatment decreases cholesterol in both cell lines, but this decrease in cholesterol only leads to a decline in viral titer in mosquito host cells, perhaps, owing to a more drastic effect on perinuclear cholesterol storages in mosquito cells that was absent in human cells. SCP-2 had no inhibitory effect on another enveloped RNA virus grown in mosquito cells, suggesting that SCP-2 does not have a generalized anti-cellular or antiviral effect. Our cell culture results imply that SCP-2 may play a limiting role in mosquito—dengue vector competence.

TI  - Stress responses in flavivirus-infected cells: activation of unfolded protein response and autophagy
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 5
AB  - The Flavivirus is a genus of RNA viruses that includes multiple long known human, animal, and zoonotic pathogens such as Dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, or Japanese encephalitis virus, as well as other less known viruses that represent potential threats for human and animal health such as Usutu or Zika viruses. Flavivirus replication is based on endoplasmic reticulum-derived structures. Membrane remodeling and accumulation of viral factors induce endoplasmic reticulum stress that results in activation of a cellular signaling response termed unfolded protein response (UPR), which can be modulated by the viruses for their own benefit. Concomitant with the activation of the UPR, an upregulation of the autophagic pathway in cells infected with different flaviviruses has also been described. This review addresses the current knowledge of the relationship between endoplasmic reticulum stress, UPR, and autophagy in flavivirus-infected cells and the growing evidences for an involvement of these cellular pathways in the replication and pathogenesis of these viruses.

JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 184 11
SP  - 1369
EP  - 73
AB  - Dengue is an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality in the tropics, but vaccine development has been impeded by a poor understanding of disease pathogenesis and, in particular, of immunologic enhancement. In a large case-control study of Vietnamese patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), variation at the HLA-A locus was significantly associated with susceptibility to DHF (P=.02), and specific HLA-A susceptibility and resistance alleles were identified. HLA-A-specific epitopes were predicted from binding motifs, and ELISPOT analyses of patients with DHF revealed high frequencies of circulating CD8 T lymphocytes that recognized both serotype-specific and -cross-reactive dengue virus epitopes. Thus, strong CD8 T cell responses are induced by natural dengue virus infection, and HLA class I genetic variation is a risk factor for DHF. These genetic and immunologic data support both protective and pathogenic roles for dengue virus-specific CD8 T cell responses in severe disease. The potentially pathogenic role of serotype-cross-reactive CD8 T cells poses yet another obstacle to successful dengue vaccine development.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 7585
EP  - 7592
AB  - ABSTRACT Previous binding studies of antibodies that recognized a partially or fully hidden epitope suggest that insect cell-derived dengue virus undergoes structural changes at an elevated temperature. This was confirmed by our cryo-electron microscopy images of dengue virus incubated at 37°C, where viruses change their surface from smooth to rough. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of dengue virus at 37°C. Image analysis showed four classes of particles. The three-dimensional (3D) map of one of these classes, representing half of the imaged virus population, shows that the E protein shell has expanded and there is a hole at the 3-fold vertices. Fitting E protein structures into the map suggests that all of the interdimeric and some intradimeric E protein interactions are weakened. The accessibility of some previously found cryptic epitopes on this class of particles is discussed.

TI  - Structural Dynamics of the Dengue Virus Non-structural 5 (NS5) Interactions with Promoter Stem Loop A (SLA)
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The dengue virus (DENV) NS5 protein plays a central role in dengue viral RNA synthesis which makes it an attractive target for antiviral drug development. DENV NS5 is known to interact with the stem-loop A (SLA) promoter at the 5’-untranslated region (5’-UTR) of the viral genome as a molecular recognition signature for the initiation of negative strand synthesis at the 3’ end of the viral genome. However, the conformational dynamics involved in these interactions are yet to be fully elucidated. Our study explores the structural dynamics of NS5 from DENV serotype 2 (DENV2 NS5) in complex with SLA, employing surface plasmon resonance (SPR), hydrogen - deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), computational modeling, and cryoEM single particle analysis to delineate the molecular details of their interaction. Our findings indicate that DENV2 NS5 binds SLA in a closed conformation with significant interdomain cooperation between the methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains, a feature integral to the interaction. Our HDX-MS studies reveal SLA-induced conformational changes in both domains of DENV2 NS5, reflecting a potential mechanism for dengue NS5’s multifunctional role in viral replication. Lastly, our cryoEM structure provides the first visualization of the DENV2 NS5-SLA complex, confirming a conserved SLA binding mode across DENV serotypes. These insights obtained from our study enhance our understanding of dengue NS5’s complex conformational landscape, supporting the potential development of antiviral strategies targeting dengue NS5’s conformational states.

TI  - Structural Flexibility of the Macrophage Dengue Virus Receptor CLEC5A
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 286
SP  - 24208
EP  - 24218
AB  - The human C-type lectin-like molecule CLEC5A is a critical macrophage receptor for dengue virus. The binding of dengue virus to CLEC5A triggers signaling through the associated adapter molecule DAP12, stimulating proinflammatory cytokine release. We have crystallized an informative ensemble of CLEC5A structural conformers at 1.9-Å resolution and demonstrate how an on-off extension to a β-sheet acts as a binary switch regulating the flexibility of the molecule. This structural information together with molecular dynamics simulations suggests a mechanism whereby extracellular events may be transmitted through the membrane and influence DAP12 signaling. We demonstrate that CLEC5A is homodimeric at the cell surface and binds to dengue virus serotypes 1–4. We used blotting experiments, surface analyses, glycan microarray, and docking studies to investigate the ligand binding potential of CLEC5A with particular respect to dengue virus. This study provides a rational foundation for understanding the dengue virus-macrophage interaction and the role of CLEC5A in dengue virus-induced lethal disease.

TI  - Structural and Functional Properties of the Capsid Protein of Dengue and Related Flavivirus
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 20
AB  - Dengue, West Nile and Zika, closely related viruses of the Flaviviridae family, are an increasing global threat, due to the expansion of their mosquito vectors. They present a very similar viral particle with an outer lipid bilayer containing two viral proteins and, within it, the nucleocapsid core. This core is composed by the viral RNA complexed with multiple copies of the capsid protein, a crucial structural protein that mediates not only viral assembly, but also encapsidation, by interacting with host lipid systems. The capsid is a homodimeric protein that contains a disordered N-terminal region, an intermediate flexible fold section and a very stable conserved fold region. Since a better understanding of its structure can give light into its biological activity, here, first, we compared and analyzed relevant mosquito-borne Flavivirus capsid protein sequences and their predicted structures. Then, we studied the alternative conformations enabled by the N-terminal region. Finally, using dengue virus capsid protein as main model, we correlated the protein size, thermal stability and function with its structure/dynamics features. The findings suggest that the capsid protein interaction with host lipid systems leads to minor allosteric changes that may modulate the specific binding of the protein to the viral RNA. Such mechanism can be targeted in future drug development strategies, namely by using improved versions of pep14-23, a dengue virus capsid protein peptide inhibitor, previously developed by us. Such knowledge can yield promising advances against Zika, dengue and closely related Flavivirus.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83

EP  - 1008
AB  - ABSTRACT The 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) of the dengue virus (DENV) genome contains two defined elements essential for viral replication. At the 5′ end, a large stem-loop (SLA) structure functions as the promoter for viral polymerase activity. Next to the SLA, there is a short stem-loop that contains a cyclization sequence known as the 5′ upstream AUG region (5′UAR). Here, we analyzed the secondary structure of the SLA in solution and the structural requirements of this element for viral replication. Using infectious DENV clones, viral replicons, and in vitro polymerase assays, we defined two helical regions, a side stem-loop, a top loop, and a U bulge within SLA as crucial elements for viral replication. The determinants for SLA-polymerase recognition were found to be common in different DENV serotypes. In addition, structural elements within the SLA required for DENV RNA replication were also conserved among different mosquito- and tick-borne flavivirus genomes, suggesting possible common strategies for polymerase-promoter recognition in flaviviruses. Furthermore, a conserved oligo(U) track present downstream of the SLA was found to modulate RNA synthesis in transfected cells. In vitro polymerase assays indicated that a sequence of at least 10 residues following the SLA, upstream of the 5′UAR, was necessary for efficient RNA synthesis using the viral 3′UTR as template.

AB  - Sequences and structures present at the 5' and 3' UTRs of RNA viruses play crucial roles in the initiation and regulation of translation, RNA synthesis and viral assembly. In dengue virus, as well as in other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, the presence of complementary sequences at the ends of the genome mediate long-range RNA-RNA interactions. Dengue virus RNA displays two pairs of complementary sequences (CS and UAR) required for genome circularization and viral viability. In order to study the molecular mechanism by which these RNA-RNA interactions participate in the viral life cycle, we developed a dengue virus replicon system. RNA transfection of the replicon in mosquito and mammalian cells allows discrimination between RNA elements involved in translation and RNA synthesis. We found that mutations within CS or UAR at the 5' or 3' ends of the RNA that interfere with base pairing did not significantly affect translation of the input RNA but seriously compromised or abolished RNA synthesis. Furthermore, a systematic mutational analysis of UAR sequences indicated that, beside the role in RNA cyclization, specific nucleotides within UAR are also important for efficient RNA synthesis.

TI  - Structural and immunological basis of cross-reactivity between dengue and Zika infections: Implications in serosurveillance in endemic regions
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 14
AB  - Dengue and Zika are arthropod-borne viral diseases present in more than 100 countries around the world. In the past decade, Zika emerged causing widespread outbreaks in new regions, where dengue has been endemic-epidemic for a long period. The wide and extensive dissemination of the mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti, and Ae. albopictus, favor the co-existence of both infections in the same regions. Together with an important proportion of asymptomatic infections, similar clinical manifestations, and a short time window for acute infection confirmatory tests, it is difficult to differentially estimate both dengue and Zika incidence and prevalence. DENV and ZIKV flavivirus share high structural similarity, inducing a cross-reactive immune response that leads to false positives in serological tests particularly in secondary infections. This results in overestimation of recent Zika outbreaks seroprevalence in dengue endemic regions. In this review, we address the biological basis underlying DENV and ZIKV structural homology; the structural and cellular basis of immunological cross reactivity; and the resulting difficulties in measuring dengue and Zika seroprevalence. Finally, we offer a perspective about the need for more research to improve serological tests performance.

TI  - Structural basis of Flavivirus NS1 assembly and antibody recognition

AB  - Significance Flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a versatile nonstructural glycoprotein that is expressed on the cell surface and secreted into the extracellular space, where it has immune evasion functions. To date, the structural biology of NS1 is limited, which has hampered a complete understanding of its functions. We describe the previously unidentified high-resolution structure of the C-terminal half of West Nile virus (WNV) and Dengue virus-1 (NS1172–352) NS1 proteins and a separate structure of WNV NS1172–352 with a protective antibody Fab. NS1172–352 forms a head-to-head dimer and adopts a unique fold with an extended β-sheet platform and opposing loop face. These structures have allowed us to develop an architectural model for NS1 assembly and function. The Flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a conserved, membrane-associated and secreted glycoprotein with replication and immune evasion functions. Secreted NS1 is a hexameric, barrel-shaped lipoprotein that can bind back to the plasma membrane of cells. Antibodies targeting cell surface-associated NS1 can be protective in vivo in a manner dependent on Fc effector functions. We describe here the crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment (residues 172–352) of West Nile (WNV) and Dengue virus NS1 proteins at 1.85 and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively. NS1172–352 assembles as a unique rod-shaped dimer composed of a 16-stranded β-platform flanked on one face by protruding connecting loops. We also determined the 3.0 Å resolution structure of WNV NS1172–352 with the protective 22NS1 antibody Fab, which engages the loop-face of the rod. The head-to-head NS1172–352 dimer we observe in crystal lattices is supported by multiangle light and small-angle X-ray scattering studies. We used the available cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction to develop a pseudoatomic model of the NS1 hexamer. The model was constructed with the NS1172–352 dimeric rod aligned with the long axis of the barrel, and with the loop-face oriented away from the core. Difference densities suggest that the N-terminal region of NS1 forms globular lobes that mediate lateral contacts between dimers in the hexamer. Our model also suggests that the N-terminal lobe forms the surface of the central cavity where lipid binding may occur.

TI  - Structural basis of transition from initiation to elongation in de novo viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
VL  - 120
AB  - Significance Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) carries out RNA synthesis through two modes of initiation: primer dependent and de novo. De novo RdRPs such as those from the family Flaviviridae utilize a priming element (PE) in their thumb domain to facilitate initiation. At initiation, PE reaches the active site and occupies the normal primer/product binding path. Upon transition to elongation, PE has to make room for the RNA duplex, but what PE does at elongation remains unresolved. Here, we report dengue virus RdRP elongation complex (EC) structures and demonstrate how PE refolds upon transition to elongation and establishes interactions with the RNA backbone to stabilize the EC, thus providing a molecular basis to this key process during RNA virus replication.

TI  - Structural complexity of Dengue virus untranslated regions: cis-acting RNA motifs and pseudoknot interactions modulating functionality of the viral genome
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 41
SP  - 5075
EP  - 5089
AB  - The Dengue virus (DENV) genome contains multiple cis-acting elements required for translation and replication. Previous studies indicated that a 719-nt subgenomic minigenome (DENV-MINI) is an efficient template for translation and (−) strand RNA synthesis in vitro. We performed a detailed structural analysis of DENV-MINI RNA, combining chemical acylation techniques, Pb2+ ion-induced hydrolysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Our results highlight protein-independent 5′–3′ terminal interactions involving hybridization between recognized cis-acting motifs. Probing analyses identified tandem dumbbell structures (DBs) within the 3′ terminus spaced by single-stranded regions, internal loops and hairpins with embedded GNRA-like motifs. Analysis of conserved motifs and top loops (TLs) of these dumbbells, and their proposed interactions with downstream pseudoknot (PK) regions, predicted an H-type pseudoknot involving TL1 of the 5′ DB and the complementary region, PK2. As disrupting the TL1/PK2 interaction, via ‘flipping’ mutations of PK2, previously attenuated DENV replication, this pseudoknot may participate in regulation of RNA synthesis. Computer modeling implied that this motif might function as autonomous structural/regulatory element. In addition, our studies targeting elements of the 3′ DB and its complementary region PK1 indicated that communication between 5′–3′ terminal regions strongly depends on structure and sequence composition of the 5′ cyclization region.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), which has four serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4), is the causative agent of the viral infection dengue. DENV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) comprises a serine protease domain and an RNA helicase domain which has nucleotide triphosphatase activities that are essential for RNA replication and viral assembly. Here, solution X-ray scattering was used to provide insight into the overall structure and flexibility of the entire NS3 and its recombinant helicase and protease domains for Dengue virus serotypes 2 and 4 in solution. The DENV-2 and DENV-4 NS3 forms are elongated and flexible in solution. The importance of the linker residues in flexibility and domain-domain arrangement was shown by the compactness of the individual protease and helicase domains. Swapping of the 174PPAVP179 linker stretch of the related Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 into DENV-2 NS3 did not alter the elongated shape of the engineered mutant. Conformational alterations owing to RNA binding are described in the protease domain, which undergoes substantial conformational alterations that are required for the optimal catalysis of bound RNA. Finally, the effects of ATPase inhibitors on the enzymatically active DENV-2 and DENV-4 NS3 and the individual helicases are presented, and insight into the allosteric effect of the inhibitor quercetin is provided.

AB  - Infection by the four serotypes of Dengue virus (DENV-1 to DENV-4) causes an important arthropod-borne viral disease in humans. The multifunctional DENV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is essential for capping and replication of the viral RNA and harbours a methyltransferase (MTase) domain and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. In this study, insights into the overall structure and flexibility of the entire NS5 of all four Dengue virus serotypes in solution are presented for the first time. The solution models derived revealed an arrangement of the full-length NS5 (NS5FL) proteins with the MTase domain positioned at the top of the RdRP domain. The DENV-1 to DENV-4 NS5 forms are elongated and flexible in solution, with DENV-4 NS5 being more compact relative to NS5 from DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3. Solution studies of the individual MTase and RdRp domains show the compactness of the RdRp domain as well as the contribution of the MTase domain and the ten-residue linker region to the flexibility of the entire NS5. Swapping the ten-residue linker between DENV-4 NS5FL and DENV-3 NS5FL demonstrated its importance in MTase-RdRp communication and in concerted interaction with viral and host proteins, as probed by amide hydrogen/deuterium mass spectrometry. Conformational alterations owing to RNA binding are presented.

JF  - Biochemistry
VL  - 51 13
SP  - 2840
EP  - 51
AB  - Dengue virus completes its protein synthesis inside human cells on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by processing the single-chain polyprotein precursor into 10 functional proteins. This vital process relies on the two-component virus-encoded protease complex; nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) possesses the proteolytic activity in its N-terminus, and NS2B acts as a fundamental activator and membrane-anchoring subunit. The membrane-associated NS2B-NS3 complex has essentially not yet been isolated or studied. We describe here a useful protocol for the preparation of the full-length NS2B-NS3 complex from dengue serotype 2 virus by utilizing a Mistic-fusion expression cassette in Escherichia coli. The protease complex was successfully solubilized and stabilized from the bacterial membrane and purified with the use of fos-choline-14 detergent. The detergent-solubilized protease complex retained autolytic activity and, intriguingly, exists as a robust trimer, implying a molecular assembly in the membrane. We further conducted a random mutagenesis study to efficiently scan for entire residues and motifs contributing to autocleavage and provide evidence of the importance of the two distal β-hairpins in the activity of the viral protease. Our results provide the first comprehensive view of an active dengue protease in the membrane-bound form.

TI  - Structure and Function of Flavivirus NS5 Methyltransferase
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 3891
EP  - 3903
AB  - ABSTRACT The plus-strand RNA genome of flavivirus contains a 5′ terminal cap 1 structure (m7GpppAmG). The flaviviruses encode one methyltransferase, located at the N-terminal portion of the NS5 protein, to catalyze both guanine N-7 and ribose 2′-OH methylations during viral cap formation. Representative flavivirus methyltransferases from dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile virus (WNV) sequentially generate GpppA → m7GpppA → m7GpppAm. The 2′-O methylation can be uncoupled from the N-7 methylation, since m7GpppA-RNA can be readily methylated to m7GpppAm-RNA. Despite exhibiting two distinct methylation activities, the crystal structure of WNV methyltransferase at 2.8 Å resolution showed a single binding site for S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM), the methyl donor. Therefore, substrate GpppA-RNA should be repositioned to accept the N-7 and 2′-O methyl groups from SAM during the sequential reactions. Electrostatic analysis of the WNV methyltransferase structure showed that, adjacent to the SAM-binding pocket, is a highly positively charged surface that could serve as an RNA binding site during cap methylations. Biochemical and mutagenesis analyses show that the N-7 and 2′-O cap methylations require distinct buffer conditions and different side chains within the K61-D146-K182-E218 motif, suggesting that the two reactions use different mechanisms. In the context of complete virus, defects in both methylations are lethal to WNV; however, viruses defective solely in 2′-O methylation are attenuated and can protect mice from later wild-type WNV challenge. The results demonstrate that the N-7 methylation activity is essential for the WNV life cycle and, thus, methyltransferase represents a novel target for flavivirus therapy.

JF  - Genetics and molecular research : GMR
VL  - 12 1
SP  - 348
EP  - 59
AB  - The surface of the dengue virus is composed of 180 copies of a multifunctional envelope glycoprotein that acts at several stages of viral infection. When the virus is in the endosome, these glycoproteins undergo major conformational rearrangements owing to the protonation of histidine side chains. This protonation allows for the formation of trimers, thereby triggering fusion between the viral and the host membranes. In this study, we examined the behavior of a monomer of this key protein containing unprotonated histidine side chains before the stage of trimer formation using explicit solvent molecular dynamics at various ionic strengths. The extended secondary structures, which contribute to protein stabilization, are smaller than those observed in a previous study involving monomers containing the protonated histidine. However, the structure of the monomer investigated herein is extremely stable under ionic strengths ranging from 0 to 225 mM. The results show that a protein surface frozen owing to interactions between charged groups is mainly responsible for this stabilization. Thus, focusing on binding sites and ligands that destabilize these properties can aid the search for dengue virus inhibitors.

TI  - Structure and function of cis‐acting RNA elements of flavivirus
JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology
VL  - 30
AB  - The genus Flavivirus is a group of single‐stranded, positive‐sense RNA viruses that includes numerous human pathogens with global impact, such as dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). The approximately 11‐kilobase genome is flanked by highly structured untranslated regions (UTRs), which contain various cis‐acting RNA elements with unique structures and functions. Moreover, local RNA elements circularize the genome non‐covalently through long‐range interactions. Interestingly, many flavivirus cis‐acting RNA elements contain group‐specific motifs or are specific for the given phylogenetic groups, suggesting their potential association with flavivirus evolution and diversification. In this review, we summarize recent advances about the structure and function of cis‐acting RNA elements in flavivirus genomes and highlight the potential implications for flavivirus evolution. Finally, the scientific questions remained to be answered in the field are also discussed.

TI  - Structure mapping of dengue and Zika viruses reveals functional long-range interactions
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are clinically important members of the Flaviviridae family with an 11 kb positive strand RNA genome that folds to enable virus function. Here, we perform structure and interaction mapping on four DENV and ZIKV strains inside virions and in infected cells. Comparative analysis of SHAPE reactivities across serotypes nominates potentially functional regions that are highly structured, conserved, and contain low synonymous mutation rates. Interaction mapping by SPLASH identifies many pair-wise interactions, 40% of which form alternative structures, suggesting extensive structural heterogeneity. Analysis of shared interactions between serotypes reveals a conserved macro-organization whereby interactions can be preserved at physical locations beyond sequence identities. We further observe that longer-range interactions are preferentially disrupted inside cells, and show the importance of new interactions in virus fitness. These findings deepen our understanding of Flavivirus genome organization and serve as a resource for designing therapeutics in targeting RNA viruses. Here, the authors provide detailed analyses of viral RNA structure in virions and in infected cells for four dengue virus serotypes and four Zika virus strains, and identify conserved structures that are important for virus replication.

TI  - Structure of Acidic pH Dengue Virus Showing the Fusogenic Glycoprotein Trimers
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 743
EP  - 750
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses undergo large conformational changes during their life cycle. Under acidic pH conditions, the mature virus forms transient fusogenic trimers of E glycoproteins that engage the lipid membrane in host cells to initiate viral fusion and nucleocapsid penetration into the cytoplasm. However, the dynamic nature of the fusogenic trimer has made the determination of its structure a challenge. Here we have used Fab fragments of the neutralizing antibody DV2-E104 to stop the conformational change of dengue virus at an intermediate stage of the fusion process. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that in this intermediate stage, the E glycoproteins form 60 trimers that are similar to the predicted “open” fusogenic trimer. IMPORTANCE The structure of a dengue virus has been captured during the formation of fusogenic trimers. This was accomplished by binding Fab fragments of the neutralizing antibody DV2-E104 to the virus at neutral pH and then decreasing the pH to 5.5. These trimers had an “open” conformation, which is distinct from the “closed” conformation of postfusion trimers. Only two of the three E proteins within each spike are bound by a Fab molecule at domain III. Steric hindrance around the icosahedral 3-fold axes prevents binding of a Fab to the third domain III of each E protein spike. Binding of the DV2-E104 Fab fragments prevents domain III from rotating by about 130° to the postfusion orientation and thus precludes the stem region from “zipping” together the three E proteins along the domain II boundaries into the “closed” postfusion conformation, thus inhibiting fusion.

JF  - Life Science Alliance
VL  - 5
AB  - Using high-resolution structure, we have characterized the substrate specificity of Aedes aegypti procarboxypeptidase B1 and provided mechanistic insights into the binding and inhibition of DENV Metallocarboxypeptidases play critical roles in the development of mosquitoes and influence pathogen/parasite infection of the mosquito midgut. Here, we report the crystal structure of Aedes aegypti procarboxypeptidase B1 (PCPBAe1), characterized its substrate specificity and mechanism of binding to and inhibiting Dengue virus (DENV). We show that the activated PCPBAe1 (CPBAe1) hydrolyzes both Arg- and Lys-substrates, which is modulated by residues Asp251 and Ser239. Notably, these residues are conserved in CPBs across mosquito species, possibly required for efficient digestion of basic dietary residues that are necessary for mosquito reproduction and development. Importantly, we characterized the interaction between PCPBAe1 and DENV envelope (E) protein, virus-like particles, and infectious virions. We identified residues Asp18A, Glu19A, Glu85, Arg87, and Arg89 of PCPBAe1 are essential for interaction with DENV. PCPBAe1 maps to the dimeric interface of the E protein domains I/II (Lys64–Glu84, Val238–Val252, and Leu278–Leu287). Overall, our studies provide general insights into how the substrate-binding property of mosquito carboxypeptidases could be targeted to potentially control mosquito populations or proposes a mechanism by which PCPBAe1 binds to and inhibits DENV.

TI  - Structure of a Dengue Virus Envelope Protein Late-Stage Fusion Intermediate
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 2287
EP  - 2293
AB  - ABSTRACT The final stages of dengue virus fusion are thought to occur when the membrane-proximal stem drives the transmembrane anchor of the viral envelope protein (E) toward the fusion loop, buried in the target cell membrane. Crystal structures of E have lacked this essential stem region. We expressed and crystallized soluble mutant forms of the dengue virus envelope protein (sE) that include portions of the juxtamembrane stem. Their structures represent late-stage fusion intermediates. The proximal part of the stem has both intra- and intermolecular interactions, so the chain “zips up” along the trimer seam. The penultimate interaction we detected involves the conserved residue F402, which has hydrophobic contacts with a conserved surface on domain II. These interactions do not require any larger-scale changes in trimer packing. The techniques for expression and crystallization of sE containing stem reported here may allow further characterization of the final stages of flavivirus fusion.

EP  - 10288
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue fever is an important emerging public health concern, with several million viral infections occurring annually, for which no effective therapy currently exists. The NS3 protein from Dengue virus is a multifunctional protein of 69 kDa, endowed with protease, helicase, and nucleoside 5′-triphosphatase (NTPase) activities. Thus, NS3 plays an important role in viral replication and represents a very interesting target for the development of specific antiviral inhibitors. We present the structure of an enzymatically active fragment of the Dengue virus NTPase/helicase catalytic domain to 2.4 Å resolution. The structure is composed of three domains, displays an asymmetric distribution of charges on its surface, and contains a tunnel large enough to accommodate single-stranded RNA. Its C-terminal domain adopts a new fold compared to the NS3 helicase of hepatitis C virus, which has interesting implications for the evolution of the Flaviviridae replication complex. A bound sulfate ion reveals residues involved in the metal-dependent NTPase catalytic mechanism. Comparison with the NS3 hepatitis C virus helicase complexed to single-stranded DNA would place the 3′ single-stranded tail of a nucleic acid duplex in the tunnel that runs across the basic face of the protein. A possible model for the unwinding mechanism is proposed.

TI  - Structure of the Immature Dengue Virus at Low pH Primes Proteolytic Maturation
JF  - Science
VL  - 319

EP  - 1837
AB  - Intracellular cleavage of immature flaviviruses is a critical step in assembly that generates the membrane fusion potential of the E glycoprotein. With cryo–electron microscopy we show that the immature dengue particles undergo a reversible conformational change at low pH that renders them accessible to furin cleavage. At a pH of 6.0, the E proteins are arranged in a herringbone pattern with the pr peptides docked onto the fusion loops, a configuration similar to that of the mature virion. After cleavage, the dissociation of pr is pH-dependent, suggesting that in the acidic environment of the trans-Golgi network pr is retained on the virion to prevent membrane fusion. These results suggest a mechanism by which flaviviruses are processed and stabilized in the host cell secretory pathway.

EP  - 9
AB  - The flavivirus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a glycoprotein that is secreted as a soluble hexameric complex during the course of natural infection. Growing evidence indicates that this secreted form of NS1 (sNS1) plays a significant role in immune evasion and modulation during infection. Attempts to determine the crystal structure of NS1 have been unsuccessful to date and relatively little is known about the macromolecular organization of the sNS1 hexamer. Here, we have applied single-particle analysis to images of baculovirus-derived recombinant dengue 2 virus NS1 obtained by electron microscopy to determine its 3D structure to a resolution of 23 Å. This structure reveals a barrel-like organization of the three dimeric units that comprise the hexamer and provides further insights into the overall organization of oligomeric sNS1.

AB  - ABSTRACT We performed a mutational analysis of the NS3 helicase of dengue virus to test insights gleaned from its crystal structure and identified four residues in the full-length protein that severely impaired either its RTPase and ATPase (Arg-457-458, Arg-460, Arg-463) or helicase (Ile-365, Arg-376) activity. Alanine substitution of Lys-396, which is located at the surface of domain II, drastically reduced all three enzymatic activities. Our study points to a pocket at the surface of domain II that may be suitable for the design of allosteric inhibitors.

TI  - Structures and Dynamics of Dengue Virus Nonstructural Membrane Proteins
JF  - Membranes
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus is an important human pathogen threating people, especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The viral genome has one open reading frame and encodes one polyprotein which can be processed into structural and nonstructural (NS) proteins. Four of the seven nonstructural proteins, NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B, are membrane proteins. Unlike NS3 or NS5, these proteins do not harbor any enzymatic activities, but they play important roles in viral replication through interactions with viral or host proteins to regulate important pathways and enzymatic activities. The location of these proteins on the cell membrane and the functional roles in viral replication make them important targets for antiviral development. Indeed, NS4B inhibitors exhibit antiviral activities in different assays. Structural studies of these proteins are hindered due to challenges in crystallization and the dynamic nature of these proteins. In this review, the function and membrane topologies of dengue nonstructural membrane proteins are presented. The roles of solution NMR spectroscopy in elucidating the structure and dynamics of these proteins are introduced. The success in the development of NS4B inhibitors proves that this class of proteins is an attractive target for antiviral development.

AB  - Structures of prM‐containing dengue and yellow fever virus particles were determined to 16 and 25 Å resolution, respectively, by cryoelectron microscopy and image reconstruction techniques. The closely similar structures show 60 icosahedrally organized trimeric spikes on the particle surface. Each spike consists of three prM:E heterodimers, where E is an envelope glycoprotein and prM is the precursor to the membrane protein M. The pre‐peptide components of the prM proteins in each spike cover the fusion peptides at the distal ends of the E glycoproteins in a manner similar to the organization of the glycoproteins in the alphavirus spikes. Each heterodimer is associated with an E and a prM transmembrane density. These transmembrane densities represent either an EE or prMprM antiparallel coiled coil by which each protein spans the membrane twice, leaving the C‐terminus of each protein on the exterior of the viral membrane, consistent with the predicted membrane‐spanning domains of the unprocessed polyprotein.

TI  - Structure‐guided insights on the role of NS1 in flavivirus infection
JF  - BioEssays
VL  - 37
AB  - We highlight the various domains of the flavivirus virulence factor NS1 and speculate on potential implications of the NS1 3D structure in understanding its role in flavivirus pathogenesis. Flavivirus non‐structural protein 1 (NS1) is a virulence factor with dual functions in genome replication and immune evasion. Crystal structures of NS1, combined with reconstructions from electron microscopy (EM), provide insight into the architecture of dimeric NS1 on cell membranes and the assembly of a secreted hexameric NS1‐lipid complex found in patient sera. Three structural domains of NS1 likely have distinct roles in membrane association, replication complex assembly, and immune system avoidance. A conserved hydrophobic inner face is sequestered either on the membrane or in the interior of the secreted hexamer and contains regions implicated in viral replication. The exposed variable outer face is presented to cellular and secreted components of the immune system in infected patients and contains candidate regions for immune system modulation. We anticipate that knowledge of the distinct NS1 domains and assembly will lead to advances in elucidating virus‐host interactions mediated through NS1 and in dissecting the role of NS1 in viral genome replication.

AB  - Introduction The endosomal toll-like receptors (TLR) TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 are localized in immune cells, recognize the viral pattern associated molecular pattern (PAMPs), and start signaling cascades for immune defense response and genetic factor is known to affect the dengue virus infection therefore in our study we study the association of endosomal Toll-like receptors 3 polymorphism rs3775291, rs3775290, and rs3775296 with rs179008 A/T and rs179009C/T polymorphisms of TLR7 and rs187084 (C/T), rs5743836 (C/T) of TLR9 gene with dengue and controls. Materials and methods Ninety-eight cases of dengue virus (DV) infection and 98 healthy controls were enrolled. Clinical details were recorded and cases were classified as severe or non-severe dengue, based on WHO 2009 classification. Genotypes were determined by Sanger sequencing using the genetic analyzer. Results An increased risk of DV infection was observed in cases as compared to controls, with TLR 3 rs3775291 CT genotype (OR = 4.34, P-value: 0.031, CI = 1.14-16.5), Likewise in TLR7 rs179008 AT (OR = 2.12, P-value: 0.034, CI = 1.06-4.26) and rs179009 CT (OR = 2.04, P-value: 0.040, CI = 1.03-4.05) same as in TLR9 rs187084 CT (OR = 1.97, P-value: 0.046, CI = 1.013-3.84) and rs5743836 (OR = 2.38, P-value: 0.009, CI = 1.24-5.57). In the above polymorphisms, mutant allele was observed in a significantly higher number in cases. The values are: for TLR3 rs3775291 T allele (OR 2.167, CI = 1.3-3.61, P-value: 0.003). TLR7 rs179008 T allele (OR 1.90, P-value: 0.021, CI = 1.07-3.35) and in TLR9 rs187084 (OR 1.91, P-value: 0.014, CI = 1.137-3.24) rs5743836 (OR 2.29, P-value: 0.0018, CI = 1.36-3.87). No significant association was observed in the genotypic frequency of severe versus non-severe dengue. Conclusion TLR3, 7, and 9 gene polymorphism might confer host genetic susceptibility to dengue in the North Indian population

JF  - ACS infectious diseases
AB  - Viral defective interfering particles (DIP) with more than 90 per cent of the genomic RNA (gRNA, ~11000 nucleotides) deleted have been detected in sera from dengue patients. The DIP RNA contains stem-loop structures in the 5' and 3' end which may permit RNA replication in the same manner as dengue virus (DENV) gRNA. Transfection of DENV2 infected human hepatoma cells with DIP RNA (DIP-296), resulted in significant inhibition of virus replication. DIP-296 RNA inhibited DENV replication in a dose-dependent manner in several cell lines tested. The mechanism of inhibition by DIP RNA is unclear however our studies imply that the retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) mediated innate immune antiviral signalling pathways and direct interactions of DIP RNA with viral replication proteins may be involved. The latter is supported by in vitro RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (REMSA) which show that DIP RNA can bind directly to DENV non-structural protein NS3 and NS5.

JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry

SP  - 8854
EP  - 8863
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) is a member of the family Flaviviridae. These positive strand RNA viruses encode a polyprotein that is processed in case of DV into 10 proteins. Although for most of these proteins distinct functions have been defined, this is less clear for the highly hydrophobic non-structural protein (NS) 4B. Despite its possible role as an antagonist of the interferon-induced antiviral response, this protein may play an additional more direct role for viral replication. In this study we determined the subcellular localization, membrane association, and membrane topology of DV NS4B. We found that NS4B resides primarily in cytoplasmic foci originating from the endoplasmic reticulum. NS4B colocalizes with NS3 and double-stranded RNA, an intermediate of viral replication, arguing that NS4B is part of the membrane-bound viral replication complex. Biochemical analysis revealed that NS4B is an integral membrane protein, and that its preceding 2K signal sequence is not required for this integration. We identified three membrane-spanning segments in the COOH-terminal part of NS4B that are sufficient to target a cytosolic marker protein to intracellular membranes. Furthermore, we established a membrane topology model of NS4B in which the NH2-terminal part of the protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, whereas the COOH-terminal part is composed of three trans-membrane domains with the COOH-terminal tail localized in the cytoplasm. This topology model provides a good starting point for a detailed investigation of the function of NS4B in the DV life cycle.

TI  - Subgenomic Flaviviral RNAs of Dengue Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) are produced during flavivirus infections in both arthropod and vertebrate cells. They are undegraded products originating from the viral 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR), a result of the action of the host 5′-3′ exoribonuclease, Xrn1, when it encounters specific RNA structures known as Xrn1-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs) within the viral 3′ UTR. Dengue viruses generate three to four distinct species of sfRNAs through the presence of two xrRNAs and two dumbbell structures (DBs). The tertiary structures of xrRNAs have been characterized to form a ringlike structure around the 5′ end of the viral RNA, effectively inhibiting the activity of Xrn1. The most important role of DENV sfRNAs is to inhibit host antiviral responses by interacting with viral and host proteins, thereby influencing viral pathogenicity, replicative fitness, epidemiological fitness, and transmission. In this review, we aimed to summarize the biogenesis, structures, and functions of DENV sfRNAs, exploring their implications for viral interference.

TI  - Substitution of NS5 N-terminal Domain of Dengue Virus Type 2 RNA with Type 4 Domain Caused Impaired Replication and Emergence of Adaptive Mutants with Enhanced Fitness*

AB  - Background: The four dengue virus serotypes, evolved from a common ancestor, are global human pathogens. Results: Interserotypic substitution of the functional domain essential for 5′-capping was detrimental to RNA replication. Conclusion: The chimeric RNA gradually evolves replication fitness through adaptive mutations in genes encoding two replication proteins. Significance: This study provides a possible pathway for generating attenuated dengue virus vaccine. Flavivirus NS3 and NS5 are required in viral replication and 5′-capping. NS3 has NS2B-dependent protease, RNA helicase, and 5′-RNA triphosphatase activities. NS5 has 5′-RNA methyltransferase (MT)/guanylyltransferase (GT) activities within the N-terminal 270 amino acids and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POL) activity within amino acids 271–900. A chimeric NS5 containing the D4MT/D4GT and the D2POL domains in the context of wild-type (WT) D2 RNA was constructed. RNAs synthesized in vitro were transfected into baby hamster kidney cells. The viral replication was analyzed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay to monitor NS1 expression and by quantitative real-time PCR. WT D2 RNA-transfected cells were NS1- positive by day 5, whereas the chimeric RNA-transfected cells became NS1-positive ∼30 days post-transfection in three independent experiments. Sequence analysis covering the entire genome revealed the appearance of a single K74I mutation within the D4MT domain ∼16 days post-transfection in two experiments. In the third, D290N mutation in the conserved NS3 Walker B motif appeared ≥16 days post-transfection. A time course study of serial passages revealed that the 30-day supernatant had gradually evolved to gain replication fitness. Trans-complementation by co-expression of WT D2 NS5 accelerated viral replication of chimeric RNA without changing the K74I mutation. However, the MT and POL activities of NS5 WT D2 and the chimeric NS5 proteins with or without the K74I mutation are similar. Taken together, our results suggest that evolution of the functional interactions involving the chimeric NS5 protein encoded by the viral genome species is essential for gain of viral replication fitness.

AB  - A C57U nucleotide mutation in a predicted RNA stem structure (nt 11-16/56-61) of the 5' non-coding region (5'NCR) of dengue 2 (DEN-2) 16681 virus is partially attenuating, but unstable during serial passage of certain candidate DEN-2 PDK-53-based vaccine viruses containing this mutation. Here, 11 different mutations (one or more point substitution and/or deletion) between nt 54 and 70 in the 5'NCR of the pD2/IC-30P-A (16681) infectious clone are described. Four mutants were infectious. Three mutants with single point substitutions replicated well in cell culture and exhibited variable neurovirulence in mice. Constructs containing multiple substitutions or any deletions failed to produce infectious viruses. Unexpectedly, a double C57U+G58C mutant replicated as efficiently as D2/IC-30P-A virus, and was more neurovirulent for newborn ICR mice. Thus, despite its predicted additional disruption of the RNA stem structure, the engineered contiguous secondary G58C mutation caused reversion of the partially attenuated phenotype caused by the 5'NCR-C57U mutation.

TI  - Subverting the mechanisms of cell death: flavivirus manipulation of host cell responses to infection.
JF  - Biochemical Society transactions
VL  - 46 3
SP  - 609
EP  - 617
AB  - Viruses exploit host metabolic and defence machinery for their own replication. The flaviviruses, which include Dengue (DENV), Yellow Fever (YFV), Japanese Encephalitis (JEV), West Nile (WNV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, infect a broad range of hosts, cells and tissues. Flaviviruses are largely transmitted by mosquito bites and humans are usually incidental, dead-end hosts, with the notable exceptions of YFV, DENV and ZIKV. Infection by flaviviruses elicits cellular responses including cell death via necrosis, pyroptosis (involving inflammation) or apoptosis (which avoids inflammation). Flaviviruses exploit these mechanisms and subvert them to prolong viral replication. The different effects induced by DENV, WNV, JEV and ZIKV are reviewed. Host cell surface proteoglycans (PGs) bearing glycosaminoglycan (GAG) polysaccharides - heparan/chondroitin sulfate (HS/CS) - are involved in initial flavivirus attachment and during the expression of non-structural viral proteins play a role in disease aetiology. Recent work has shown that ZIKV-infected cells are protected from cell death by exogenous heparin (a GAG structurally similar to host cell surface HS), raising the possibility of further subtle involvement of HS PGs in flavivirus disease processes. The aim of this review is to synthesize information regarding DENV, WNV, JEV and ZIKV from two areas that are usually treated separately: the response of host cells to infection by flaviviruses and the involvement of cell surface GAGs in response to those infections.

TI  - Super-resolution optical microscopy reveals accumulation of photoactivable dengue protein (Dendra2-NS2B) in the endoplasmic reticulum
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 15
AB  - The non-structural protein NS2B plays a critical role in the maturation of Dengue virus (DENV Type 2). The underlying mechanism and the role of NS2B are largely unknown due to the unavailability of its location of activity in the target organelle at single molecule level. This is largely due to the incapability of existing optical microscopes to resolve features beyond the diffraction limit of light (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim \lambda /2$$\end{document}), which is limited to a few hundred nanometers. Existing microscopy techniques are at best useful for ensemble study and details at the single molecule level remain hidden. To enable single-molecule resolution, we investigated the role of NS2B protein in a cellular system using scanning single molecule localization microscopy (scanSMLM). Accordingly, a photoactivable plasmid (Dendra2-NS2B) containing the gene-of-interest (NS2B) was constructed and the same is used to transfect NIH3T3 cells. Both super-resolution and confocal imaging studies suggest the accumulation of NS2B proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Subsequently, single-molecule analysis is carried out, where a total of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim 41$$\end{document} NS2B aggregates (both big and small) are noted with an area-spread of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0.055 \pm 0.008 ~\upmu {\text {m}}^2$$\end{document}, the molecular density of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$4358\pm 1170~mol/ \upmu {\text {m}}^2$$\end{document}, and an average of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$174\pm 38$$\end{document} NS2B molecules per cluster. Moreover, the super-resolved volume image revealed NS2B clusters spreading across several planes with a few extending up to 5 planes (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim 2.5 ~\upmu {\text {m}}$$\end{document} from the coverslip). In addition, the collective dynamics of NS2B proteins leading to the formation of clusters is evident from time-lapse super-resolved data that provides conclusive evidence of NS2B accumulation, 24 hrs post-transfection. The present study revealed the dynamics of NS2B single viral protein molecule, and its accumulation at ER that may ultimately lead to organelle-specific drug targeting and help to reduce the rate of dengue infection by disrupting the NS2B accumulates.

TI  - Superficial vimentin mediates DENV-2 infection of vascular endothelial cells
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 6
AB  - Damage to vascular endothelial cells (VECs) is a critical hallmark of hemorrhagic diseases caused by dengue virus (DENV). However, the precise molecular event involved in DENV binding and infection of VECs has yet to be clarified. In this study, vimentin (55 kDa) was identified to be involved in DENV-2 adsorption into VECs. This protein is located on the surface of VECs and interacts with DENV-2 envelope protein domain III (EDIII). The expression level of the superficial vimentin on VECs was not affected by viral infection or siRNA interference, indicating that the protein exists in a particular mode. Furthermore, the rod domain of the vimentin protein mainly functions in DENV-2 adsorption into VECs. Molecular docking results predicted several residues in vimentin rod and DENV EDIII; these residues may be responsible for cell–virus interactions. We propose that the superficial vimentin could be a novel molecule involved in DENV binding and infection of VECs. DENV EDIII directly interacts with the rod domain of vimentin on the VEC surface and thus mediates the infection.

TI  - Suppressed expression of miR-378 targeting gzmb in NK cells is required to control dengue virus infection
JF  - Cellular and Molecular Immunology
VL  - 13
SP  - 700
EP  - 708
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) remains a major public health threat because no vaccine or drugs are available for the prevention and treatment of DENV infection, and the immunopathogenesis mechanisms of DENV infection are not fully understood. Cytotoxic molecules, such as granzyme B (GrzB), may be necessary to control viral infections. However, the exact role of GrzB during DENV infection and the mechanisms regulating GrzB expression during DENV infection are not clear. This study found that miR-27a*, miR-30e, and miR-378 were down-regulated in DENV-infected patients, and DENV infection in humans induced a significant up-regulation of GrzB in natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells. Further investigation indicated that NK cells, but not CD8+ T cells, were the major sources of GrzB, and miR-378, but not miR-27a* or miR-30e, suppressed GrzB expression in NK cells. Notably, we found that overexpression of miR-378 using a miR-378 agomir in DENV-infected mice inhibited GrzB expression and promoted DENV replication. These results suggest the critical importance of miR-378 in the regulation of GrzB expression and a protective role for GrzB in controlling DENV replication in vivo. Therefore, this study provides a new insight into the immunopathogenesis mechanism of DENV infection and a biological basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies to control DENV infection.

TI  - Suppressing Dengue-2 Infection by Chemical Inhibition of Aedes aegypti Host Factors
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus host factors (DENV HFs) that are essential for the completion of the infection cycle in the mosquito vector and vertebrate host represent potent targets for transmission blocking. Here we investigated whether known mammalian DENV HF inhibitors could influence virus infection in the arthropod vector A. aegypti. We evaluated the potency of bafilomycin (BAF; inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase (vATPase)), mycophenolic acid (MPA; inhibitor of inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH)), castanospermine (CAS; inhibitor of glucosidase), and deoxynojirimycin (DNJ; inhibitor of glucosidase) in blocking DENV infection of the mosquito midgut, using various treatment methods that included direct injection, ingestion by sugar feeding or blood feeding, and silencing of target genes by RNA interference (RNAi). Injection of BAF (5 µM) and MPA (25 µM) prior to feeding on virus-infected blood inhibited DENV titers in the midgut at 7 days post-infection by 56% and 60%, and in the salivary gland at 14 days post-infection by 90% and 83%, respectively, while treatment of mosquitoes with CAS or DNJ did not affect susceptibility to the virus. Ingestion of BAF and MPA through a sugar meal or together with an infectious blood meal also resulted in various degrees of virus inhibition. RNAi-mediated silencing of several vATPase subunit genes and the IMPDH gene resulted in a reduced DENV infection, thereby indicating that BAF- and MPA-mediated virus inhibition in adult mosquitoes most likely occurred through the inhibition of these DENV HFs. The route and timing of BAF and MPA administration was essential, and treatment after exposure to the virus diminished the antiviral effect of these compounds. Here we provide proof-of-principle that chemical inhibition or RNAi-mediated depletion of the DENV HFs vATPase and IMPDH can be used to suppress DENV infection of adult A. aegypti mosquitoes, which may translate to a reduction in DENV transmission.

TI  - Suppression of TGF‐β/Smad2 signaling by GW788388 enhances DENV‐2 clearance in macrophages
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 94
SP  - 4359
EP  - 4368
AB  - Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus (DENV‐1, −2, −3, and −4), affects millions of people in the tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Severe dengue is correlated with high viraemia and cytokine storm, such as high levels of transforming growth factor‐β1 (TGF‐β1) in the patient's serum. Here, the TGF‐β1 signaling was investigated in the context of in vitro viral clearance. Macrophages were infected with DENV‐2 at MOI 5 and treated with the TGF‐β receptor 1 and 2 inhibitor, GW788388. TGF‐β1 expression, signal transduction and viral load were evaluated 48 h after DENV‐2 infection by enzyme‐linked immunoassay, immunofluorescence, and RT‐qPCR assays. Total TGF‐β1 level was reduced in 15% after DENV‐2 infection, but the secretion of its biologically active form increased threefold during infection, which was followed by the phosphorylation of Smad2 protein. Phosphorylation of Smad2 was reduced by treatment with GW788388 and it was correlated with reduced cytokine production. Importantly, treatment led to a dose‐dependent reduction in viral load, ranging from 6.6 × 105 RNA copies/ml in untreated cultures to 2.3 × 103 RNA copies/ml in cultures treated with 2 ng/ml of GW788388. The anti‐TGF‐β1 antibody treatment also induced a significant reduction in viral load to 1.6 × 103 RNA copies/ml. On the other hand, the addition of recombinant TGF‐β1 in infected cultures promoted an increase in viral load to 7.0 × 106 RNA copies/ml. These results support that TGF‐β1 plays a significant role in DENV‐2 replication into macrophages and suggest that targeting TGF‐β1 may represent an alternative therapeutic strategy to be explored in dengue infection.

TI  - Suppression of the pelo protein by Wolbachia and its effect on dengue virus in Aedes aegypti
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 12
AB  - The endosymbiont Wolbachia is known to block replication of several important arboviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), in the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. So far, the exact mechanism of this viral inhibition is not fully understood. A recent study in Drosophila melanogaster has demonstrated an interaction between the pelo gene and Drosophila C virus. In this study, we explored the possible involvement of the pelo protein, that is involved in protein translation, in Wolbachia-mediated antiviral response and mosquito-DENV interaction. We found that pelo is upregulated during DENV replication and its silencing leads to reduced DENV virion production suggesting that it facilities DENV replication. However, in the presence of Wolbachia, specifically in female mosquitoes, the pelo protein is downregulated and its subcellular localization is altered, which could contribute to reduction in DENV replication in Ae. aegypti. In addition, we show that the microRNA aae-miR-2940-5p, whose abundance is highly enriched in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, might mediate regulation of pelo. Our data reveals identification of pelo as a host factor that is positively involved in DENV replication, and its suppression in the presence of Wolbachia may contribute to virus blocking exhibited by the endosymbiont.

TI  - Suppressive Effects of the Site 1 Protease (S1P) Inhibitor, PF-429242, on Dengue Virus Propagation
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 8
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes one of the most widespread mosquito-borne diseases in the world. Despite the great need, effective vaccines and practical antiviral therapies are still under development. Intracellular lipid levels are regulated by sterol regulatory elements-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are activated by serine protease, site 1 protease (S1P). Small compound PF-429242 is known as a S1P inhibitor and the antivirus effects have been reported in some viruses. In this study, we examined the anti-DENV effects of PF-429242 using all four serotypes of DENV by several primate-derived cell lines. Moreover, emergence of drug-resistant DENV mutants was assessed by sequential passages with the drug. DENV dependency on intracellular lipids during their infection was also evaluated by adding extracellular lipids. The addition of PF-429242 showed suppression of viral propagation in all DENV serotypes. We showed that drug-resistant DENV mutants are unlikely to emerge after five times sequential passages through treatment with PF-429242. Although the levels of intracellular cholesterol and lipid droplets were reduced by PF-429242, viral propagations were not recovered by addition of exogenous cholesterol or fatty acids, indicating that the reduction of LD and cholesterol caused by PF-429242 treatment is not related to its mechanism of action against DENV propagation. Our results suggest that PF-429242 is a promising candidate for an anti-DENV agent.

JF  - Virulence
VL  - 8

EP  - 1731
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infection can cause severe, life-threatening events, and no specific treatments of DENV infection are currently approved. Although thrombocytopenia is frequently observed in dengue patients, its pathogenesis is still not fully understood. Previous studies have suggested that DENV-induced thrombocytopenia occurs through viral-replication-mediated megakaryopoiesis inhibition in the bone marrow; however, the exact mechanism for megakaryopoiesis suppression remains elusive. In this study, a reductionist approach was applied, in which C57B/6J mice were inoculated with recombinant DENV-envelope protein domain III (DENV-EIII) instead of the full viral particle. Our results demonstrated that DENV-EIII-suppressed megakaryopoiesis is similar to those observed with DENV infection. Furthermore, in agreement with our in vivo analyses, DENV-EIII sufficiently suppressed the megakaryopoiesis of progenitor cells from murine bone marrow and human cord blood in vitro. Additional analyses suggested that autophagy impairment and apoptosis are involved in DENV-EIII-mediated suppression of megakaryopoiesis. These data suggest that, even without viral replication, the binding of DENV-EIII to the cell surface is sufficient to suppress megakaryopoiesis.

AB  - Abstract Survival and replication of dengue-2 virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, DENV-2) was determined in diapausing eggs of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) to evaluate the importance of this mechanism for viral maintenance during adverse climatic conditions. Infected and uninfected eggs of Ae. albopictus were induced to diapause under low temperature and short photoperiod. Virus was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and isolated in C6/36 cells from both diapausing eggs and nondiapausing eggs. Nucleic acid hybridization was used to monitor viral replication in diapausing eggs. DENV-2 might survive in infected diapausing eggs in a relatively quiescent status based on the absence of a replicative intermediate RNA. In contrast, the viral replicative intermediate RNA along with the replicative form RNA was detected in nondiapausing eggs. It seemed that the virus replicated more actively in nondiapausing eggs than in diapausing eggs. Infected diapausing eggs may play an important role in the maintenance of DENV during adverse climatic conditions in nature.

TI  - Susceptibility and Response of Human Blood Monocyte Subsets to Primary Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Human blood monocytes play a central role in dengue infections and form the majority of virus infected cells in the blood. Human blood monocytes are heterogeneous and divided into CD16− and CD16+ subsets. Monocyte subsets play distinct roles during disease, but it is not currently known if monocyte subsets differentially contribute to dengue protection and pathogenesis. Here, we compared the susceptibility and response of the human CD16− and CD16+ blood monocyte subsets to primary dengue virus in vitro. We found that both monocyte subsets were equally susceptible to dengue virus (DENV2 NGC), and capable of supporting the initial production of new infective virus particles. Both monocyte subsets produced anti-viral factors, including IFN-α, CXCL10 and TRAIL. However, CD16+ monocytes were the major producers of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to dengue virus, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2, 3 and 4. The susceptibility of both monocyte subsets to infection was increased after IL-4 treatment, but this increase was more profound for the CD16+ monocyte subset, particularly at early time points after virus exposure. These findings reveal the differential role that monocyte subsets might play during dengue disease.

AB  - The susceptibility of the C6/36 clone of Aedes albopictus monolayer cell cultures was determined with 46 prototype viruses passed through three subcultures. Viral growth was confirmed by titration of the passage material in other susceptible host systems. Nineteen viruses demonstrated good growth in C6/36 cells: coxsackievirus group A type 10 and group B types 2, 3, 4, and 5; enterovirus 69; mumps virus; poliovirus types 1 to 3; reovirus types 1 to 3; vaccinia virus; dengue virus type 2; eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus; La Crosse virus; Rocio virus; and St. Louis encephalitis virus. Ten viruses did not adapt to growth in the C6/36 cultures. Seventeen other virus strains displayed only limited growth which was primarily restricted to the initial C6/36 passage or was detected by hemagglutinin reactions without observable cell degeneration. Of the 46 viruses, 33 (72%) were capable of initiating infection with a demonstrable cytopathic effect in the initial C6/36 passage. Hemagglutination or complement fixation titers or both were obtained with dengue virus type 2, eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus, La Crosse virus, mumps virus, reovirus types 1 to 3, and Rocio, St. Louis encephalitis, and vaccinia viruses.

VL  - 50
SP  - 179
EP  - 184
AB  - ABSTRACT Mosquitoes vertically transmit many arthropod borne viruses, and as a consequence arboviruses are often present within the larval environment. We tested the hypothesis that Aedes aegypti (L.) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) larvae were susceptible to dengue virus through two infection methods: exposure to dengue in the larval growth environment via viral supernatant, and exposure to infected tissue culture along with viral supernatant. In addition to investigating for the first time the susceptibility of larval Ae. albopictus to dengue virus, we analyzed the infection rate and viral titer of infected pools of Ae. aegypti when exposed to multiple serotypes of dengue. We found that both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus larvae were susceptible to the three dengue virus serotypes to which they were exposed regardless of the exposure method and that there were significant differences between the serotypes in infection titer and infection rate. The finding that larval Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are susceptible to dengue indicates that dengue might be able to spread among larvae within the larval habitat potentially contributing to the persistence of dengue in the environment.

EP  - 239
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate whether the J774 mouse macrophage cell line could be used as an in vitro model for dengue virus infection (DENV). After 3 days, infection in J774 cells was assessed by detecting dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NSP-1) production either by dot blot or indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) of saponine-permeabilized J774 cells and then confirmed by RT-PCR (171 bp product, corresponding to the DENV-2 core). Based on the presence of NSP-1 in infected but not in non-infected cells by both IFA and dot blot, as well as the amplification of a 171-bp DENV-2-specific RT-PCR product exclusively in the infected cells, the J774 cell line was found to be permissive for dengue virus infection. As far as we know, this is the first report that the J774 mouse macrophage cell line is infected with dengue virus and, thus, that it can be used as an alternative in vitro model for dengue virus infection studies. This finding could help to further elucidate the mechanisms involved in dengue virus infection and pathogenesis.

TI  - Sustained Wolbachia-mediated blocking of dengue virus isolates following serial passage in Aedes aegypti cell culture
JF  - Virus Evolution
VL  - 5
AB  - Abstract Wolbachia is an intracellular endosymbiont of insects that inhibits the replication of a range of pathogens in its arthropod hosts. The release of Wolbachia into wild populations of mosquitoes is an innovative biocontrol effort to suppress the transmission of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) to humans, most notably dengue virus. The success of the Wolbachia-based approach hinges upon the stable persistence of the ‘pathogen blocking’ effect, whose mechanistic basis is poorly understood. Evidence suggests that Wolbachia may affect viral replication via a combination of competition for host resources and activation of host immunity. The evolution of resistance against Wolbachia and pathogen blocking in the mosquito or the virus could reduce the public health impact of the symbiont releases. Here, we investigate if dengue 3 virus (DENV-3) is capable of accumulating adaptive mutations that improve its replicative capacity during serial passage in Wolbachia wMel-infected cells. During the passaging regime, viral isolates in Wolbachia-infected cells exhibited greater variation in viral loads compared to controls. The viral loads of these isolates declined rapidly during passaging due to the blocking effects of Wolbachia carriage, with several being lost all together and the remainder recovering to low but stable levels. We attempted to sequence the genomes of the surviving passaged isolates but, given their low abundance, were unable to obtain sufficient depth of coverage for evolutionary analysis. In contrast, viral loads in Wolbachia-free control cells were consistently high during passaging. The surviving isolates passaged in the presence of Wolbachia exhibited a reduced ability to replicate even in Wolbachia-free cells. These experiments demonstrate the challenge for dengue in evolving resistance to Wolbachia-mediated blocking.

TI  - Symbiotic Wolbachia in mosquitoes and its role in reducing the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases: updates and prospects
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 14
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, West Nile virus, chikungunya, Zika fever, and filariasis have the greatest health and economic impact. These mosquito-borne diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical and sub-tropical areas. Due to the lack of effective vector containment strategies, the prevalence and severity of these diseases are increasing in endemic regions. Nowadays, mosquito infection by the endosymbiotic Wolbachia represents a promising new bio-control strategy. Wild-infected mosquitoes had been developing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), phenotypic alterations, and nutrition competition with pathogens. These reduce adult vector lifespan, interfere with reproduction, inhibit other pathogen growth in the vector, and increase insecticide susceptibility of the vector. Wild, uninfected mosquitoes can also establish stable infections through trans-infection and have the advantage of adaptability through pathogen defense, thereby selectively infecting uninfected mosquitoes and spreading to the entire population. This review aimed to evaluate the role of the Wolbachia symbiont with the mosquitoes (Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex) in reducing mosquito-borne diseases. Global databases such as PubMed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, and pro-Quest were accessed to search for potentially relevant articles. We used keywords: Wolbachia, Anopheles, Aedes, Culex, and mosquito were used alone or in combination during the literature search. Data were extracted from 56 articles’ texts, figures, and tables of the included article.

TI  - Syncytial and Congregative Effects of Dengue and Zika Viruses on the Aedes Albopictus Cell Line Differ among the Viral Strains.
JF  - Zoonoses
VL  - 3 1
AB  - Objective
Dengue viruses (DENV) and Zika viruses (ZIKV) are transmitted from human to human or from non-human primates to humans by mosquito biting, so the viral interaction with mosquito cells is one key step within the viral life cycle. Therefore, our objective is to know how DENV or ZIKV interacts with mosquito cells.


Methods
Immunofluorescence assay and a direct visualization system are combined to monitor the syncytial or congregative effects of DENVs and ZIKVs on C6/36 cells. we studied the cytopathic effects of DENVs and ZIKVs on the mosquito cells, C6/36 which are widely used in the laboratory for the infections of DENV and ZIKV.


Results
Our results show that all strains of DENV-1 and DENV-2, most DENV-4 and some DENV-3 strains caused syncytial effects on C6/36 cells, while some DENV-3 and DENV-4 strains, and all the tested ZIKV strains caused cell congregation after infection but no cell fusion. In addition, we detected a range of pH environments from 6.0 to 8.0 that support the virus-caused cell fusion and figured out that the optimal pH condition is 7.5 at which the viral production is also the best. Furthermore, viral replication may be required for DENV's syncytial effects on C6/36 cells because the UV-inactivated virus failed to cause cell fusion.


Conclusion
Syncytial and congregative effects of DENV and ZIKV on the Aedes albopictus cells differ among the viral strains. Syncytial effects of DENV on C6/36 are important for viral replication.

JF  - Japanese journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 70 2
SP  - 186
EP  - 191
AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) is a severe pathological manifestation of dengue virus (DENV) infection. Enhanced production of cytokines in dengue patients is proposed to induce endothelial barrier instability resulting in increased vascular leakage. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α is an inflammatory cytokine that activates endothelial cells and enhances vascular permeability and plasma leakage in DHF/DSS. The present study investigated the in vitro effect of TNF-α and DENV infection on the expression of adherence junction proteins, tight junction proteins, and membrane integrity of human endothelial cell lines. Immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis demonstrated platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) reorganization and decreased levels of the tight junction protein occludin in human endothelial cells treated with TNF-α and DENV, compared to mock, DENV, or TNF-α-treated cells. Permeability assessed by FITC-dextran as a transport molecule was increased and correlated with the unusual reorganization of PECAM-1. The altered distribution of PECAM-1 and low occludin protein levels in human endothelial cells treated with TNF-α and DENV correlated with increased permeability. In conclusion, the synergistic effect of TNF-α and DENV induced permeability changes in endothelial cells. These results contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying enhanced vascular permeability in DENV infection.

TI  - Synergistic Interactions between the NS3hel and E Proteins Contribute to the Virulence of Dengue Virus Type 1
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 6
AB  - Background Dengue includes a broad range of symptoms, ranging from fever to hemorrhagic fever and may occasionally have alternative clinical presentations. Many possible viral genetic determinants of the intrinsic virulence of dengue virus (DENV) in the host have been identified, but no conclusive evidence of a correlation between viral genotype and virus transmissibility and pathogenicity has been obtained. Methodology/Principal Findings We used reverse genetics techniques to engineer DENV-1 viruses with subsets of mutations found in two different neuroadapted derivatives. The mutations were inserted into an infectious clone of DENV-1 not adapted to mice. The replication and viral production capacity of the recombinant viruses were assessed in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrated that paired mutations in the envelope protein (E) and in the helicase domain of the NS3 (NS3hel) protein had a synergistic effect enhancing viral fitness in human and mosquito derived cell lines. E mutations alone generated no detectable virulence in the mouse model; however, the combination of these mutations with NS3hel mutations, which were mildly virulent on their own, resulted in a highly neurovirulent phenotype. Conclusions/Significance The generation of recombinant viruses carrying specific E and NS3hel proteins mutations increased viral fitness both in vitro and in vivo by increasing RNA synthesis and viral load (these changes being positively correlated with central nervous system damage), the strength of the immune response and animal mortality. The introduction of only pairs of amino acid substitutions into the genome of a non-mouse adapted DENV-1 strain was sufficient to alter viral fitness substantially. Given current limitations to our understanding of the molecular basis of dengue neuropathogenesis, these results could contribute to the development of attenuated strains for use in vaccinations and provide insights into virus/host interactions and new information about the mechanisms of basic dengue biology.

AB  - The 2015-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Americas has brought this relatively unknown flavivirus into the spotlight as the etiologic agent of congenital Zika syndrome in newborns and, potentially, of Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. ZIKV shares a high degree of amino acid sequence homology with the closely related flavivirus Dengue virus (DENV). Due to the paucity of research investigating T cell-mediated immune responses to ZIKV, the precise roles of T cells in protection against and pathogenesis of ZIKV infection are unclear. Nevertheless, knowledge gained from studies of T cell responses to other flaviviruses, such as the four DENV serotypes, provides a framework for investigating and understanding anti-ZIKV T cell responses. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of how T cells respond to primary and secondary infections with DENV and ZIKV. A thorough understanding of the role of ZIKV-specific and DENV cross-reactive T cells in controlling infection is essential for developing ZIKV- and DENV-specific vaccines with maximal safety and efficacy.

TI  - T Cell Responses to Nonstructural Protein 3 Distinguish Infections by Dengue and Zika Viruses
JF  - mBio
VL  - 9
AB  - ABSTRACT The 2015–2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas and the Caribbean demonstrated that clinical assays to detect, distinguish, and characterize immune responses to flaviviral infections are needed. ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV) are mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses sharing overlapping geographic distributions and have significant sequence similarities that can increase the potential for antibody and T cell cross-reaction. Using nonstructural protein 1-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we determined the serostatus of individuals living in a region of DENV and ZIKV endemicity in Brazil, identifying individuals with primary DENV (pDENV) and primary ZIKV (pZIKV), ZIKV with primary DENV (ZIKVwpDENV), and secondary DENV (sDENV) infections; the presence of pDENV and pZIKV was further confirmed by neutralization tests. Development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay for DENV and ZIKV structural and nonstructural (NS) protein antigens enabled us to distinguish infections by these viruses based on T cell responses and to characterize those responses. We found that gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) T cell responses to NS3 differentiated DENV and ZIKV infections with 94% sensitivity and 92% specificity. In general, we also showed that pDENV and sDENV cases and pZIKV and ZIKVwpDENV cases elicit similar T cell response patterns and that HIV-infected individuals show T cell responses that are lower than those shown by HIV-negative individuals. These results have important implications for DENV and ZIKV diagnostic and vaccine development and provide critical insights into the T cell response in individuals with multiple flaviviral infections. IMPORTANCE The potential for antibody and T cell cross-reactions to DENV and ZIKV, flaviviruses that cocirculate and can sequentially infect individuals, has complicated diagnostic and vaccine development. Our serological data show that antibodies to nonstructural protein 1 can distinguish sequential human infections by DENV and ZIKV. The development of a simple and inexpensive assay also enables the differentiation of DENV and ZIKV infections based on characterization of T cell responses. Our T cell data reveal strong response patterns that are similar in nature to those seen with individuals with one or multiple DENV infections and with individuals with only primary ZIKV infection and ZIKV-infected individuals with previous DENV exposure. The characterization of T cell responses in a serologically validated group of individuals is of relevance to the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics against these global threats.

JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 168

EP  - 5965
AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), the severe manifestation of dengue virus (DV) infection characterized by plasma leakage, is more common in secondary DV infections in previously infected individuals and is associated with high levels of immune activation. To determine the Ag specificity of this immune response, we studied the response to an HLA-B*07-restricted T cell epitope, residues 221–232 of the DV NS3 protein, in 10 HLA-B*07+ Thai children who were studied during and after acute DV infections. Peptide-specific T cells were detected in 9 of 10 subjects. The frequency of peptide-specific T cells was higher in subjects who had experienced DHF than in those who had experienced DF. We also detected peptide-specific T cells in PBMC obtained at the time of the acute DV infection in 2 of 5 subjects. These data suggest that the NS3 (221–232) epitope is an important target of CD8+ T cells in secondary DV infection and that the activation and expansion of DV-specific T cells is greater in subjects with DHF than in those with dengue fever. These findings support the hypothesis that activation of DV-specific CD8+ T cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of DHF.

AB  - The available evidence suggests that plasma leakage in dengue hemorrhagic fever is caused by the action of circulating mediators on the vascular endothelium, and that the host immune response is a critical determinant of this response. We have been exploring the role of dengue virus–specific T lymphocytes in the immunopathogenesis of plasma leakage. Memory dengue virus–specific T cells induced during a primary dengue virus infection are reactivated by the heterologous viral serotype during a secondary infection to expand to high levels and produce a skewed cytokine profile. Investigations are underway to identify the immunologic profiles associated with increased or decreased risk for severe disease.

AB  - The enhancement of severe disease upon secondary infection makes dengue almost unique among infectious pathogens and presents a serious challenge to vaccine design. Several key observations have been made which shed light onto this phenomenon particularly that antibodies can enhance Fc receptor-dependent uptake of virus into macrophages thereby increasing virus replication. Furthermore there seems to be a relationship between the peak virus load and disease severity. However, a second key feature of dengue is that the life-threatening symptoms do not correlate with the period of high viraemia; instead they occur at a time when the virus load is in steep decline. The coincidence of severe disease manifestations with defervescence and virus control suggests that the symptoms may be a consequence of the immune response to the virus rather than virus induced cytopathology. One of the key elements in the immune response to viruses are T cells which can both secrete a host of inflammatory cytokines and also be directly cytotoxic to infected cells. There are a number of experimental models of T cell-induced immunopathology including in responses to viruses. Particularly interesting in this respect are models of RSV-induced immunopathology, which have direct relevance to vaccine design as a formalin-inactivated vaccine to RSV actually enhanced disease in children when they became naturally infected with RSV, an echo of the disease enhancement seen in dengue. We will present an analysis of CD8+ T cell responses to a number of novel T cell epitopes during dengue infection and also analyse the function and cytokine secretion of these cells. We suggest that an exaggerated and partially misdirected T cell response seen in secondary dengue infection may be part of the complex series of events leading to dengue haemorrhagic fever and shock.

TI  - T-Cell Immunity to Infection with Dengue Virus in Humans
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 5
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the etiologic agent of dengue fever, the most significant mosquito-borne viral disease in humans. Up to 400 million DENV infections occur every year, and severity can range from asymptomatic to an acute self-limiting febrile illness. In a small proportion of patients, the disease can exacerbate and progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever and/or dengue shock syndrome, characterized by severe vascular leakage, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhagic manifestations. A unique challenge in vaccine development against DENV is the high degree of sequence variation, characteristically associated with RNA viruses. This is of particular relevance in the case of DENV since infection with one DENV serotype (primary infection) presumably affords life-long serotype-specific immunity but only partial and temporary immunity to other serotypes in secondary infection settings. The role of T cells in DENV infection and subsequent disease manifestations is not fully understood. According to the original antigenic sin theory, skewing of T-cell responses induced by primary infection with one serotype causes less effective response upon secondary infection with a different serotype, predisposing to severe disease. Our recent study has suggested an HLA-linked protective role for T cells. Herein, we will discuss the role of T cells in protection and pathogenesis from severe disease as well as the implications for vaccine design.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Dengue virus infection induces specific CD4+CD8– and CD8+CD4– T cells in humans. In primary infection, T-cell responses to DENV are serotype cross-reactive, but the highest response is to the serotype that caused the infection. The epitopes recognized by DENV-specific T cells are located in most of the structural and non-structural proteins, but NS3 is the protein that is most dominantly recognized. In patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) caused by secondary DENV infection, T cells are highly activated in vivo. These highly activated T cells are DENV-specific and oligoclonal. Multiple kinds of lymphokines are produced by the activated T cells, and it has been hypothesized that these lymphokines are responsible for induction of plasma leakage, one of the most characteristic features of DHF. Thus, T-cells play important roles in the pathogenesis of DHF and in the recovery from DENV infection.

TI  - TIM-1 As a Signal Receptor Triggers Dengue Virus-Induced Autophagy
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 20
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection triggers the activation of autophagy to facilitate the viral replication cycle from various aspects. Although a number of stimulators are proposed to activate autophagy, none of them appears prior to the uncoating process. Given that T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) receptor is a putative DENV receptor and promotes apoptotic body clearance by autophagy induction, it raises the possibility that TIM-1 may participate in the activation of DENV-induced autophagy. In this study, confocal images first revealed the co-localization of TIM-1 with autophagosomes in DENV-induced autophagy rather than rapamycin-induced autophagy, suggesting the co-transportation of TIM-1 with DENV during infection. The treatment of siRNA to knockdown TIM-1 expression in DENV-infected GFP-microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-Huh7.5 cells revealed that TIM-1 is required not only for DENV cellular internalization but also for autophagy activation. Furthermore, knockdown p85, a subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), which is co-localized with TIM-1 at rab5-positive endosomes caused the reduction of autophagy, indicating that TIM-1-mediated DENV-induced autophagy requires p85. Taken together, the current study uncovered TIM-1 as a novel factor for triggering autophagy in DENV infection through TIM-1-p85 axis, in addition to serving as a DENV receptor.

TI  - TIM-family Proteins Promote Infection of Multiple Enveloped Viruses through Virion-associated Phosphatidylserine
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 9
AB  - Human T-cell Immunoglobulin and Mucin-domain containing proteins (TIM1, 3, and 4) specifically bind phosphatidylserine (PS). TIM1 has been proposed to serve as a cellular receptor for hepatitis A virus and Ebola virus and as an entry factor for dengue virus. Here we show that TIM1 promotes infection of retroviruses and virus-like particles (VLPs) pseudotyped with a range of viral entry proteins, in particular those from the filovirus, flavivirus, New World arenavirus and alphavirus families. TIM1 also robustly enhanced the infection of replication-competent viruses from the same families, including dengue, Tacaribe, Sindbis and Ross River viruses. All interactions between TIM1 and pseudoviruses or VLPs were PS-mediated, as demonstrated with liposome blocking and TIM1 mutagenesis experiments. In addition, other PS-binding proteins, such as Axl and TIM4, promoted infection similarly to TIM1. Finally, the blocking of PS receptors on macrophages inhibited the entry of Ebola VLPs, suggesting that PS receptors can contribute to infection in physiologically relevant cells. Notably, infection mediated by the entry proteins of Lassa fever virus, influenza A virus and SARS coronavirus was largely unaffected by TIM1 expression. Taken together our data show that TIM1 and related PS-binding proteins promote infection of diverse families of enveloped viruses, and may therefore be useful targets for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.

TI  - TLR2 axis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells regulates inflammatory responses to non-infectious immature dengue virus particles
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 18
AB  - Severe dengue virus (DENV) infection is characterized by exacerbated inflammatory responses that lead to endothelial dysfunction and plasma leakage. We have recently demonstrated that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on blood monocytes senses DENV infection leading to endothelial activation. Here, we report that non-infectious immature DENV particles, which are released in large numbers by DENV-infected cells, drive endothelial activation via the TLR2 axis. We show that fully immature DENV particles induce a rapid, within 6 hours post-infection, inflammatory response in PBMCs. Furthermore, pharmacological blocking of TLR2/TLR6/CD14 and/or NF-kB prior to exposure of PBMCs to immature DENV reduces the initial production of inter alia TNF-α and IL-1β by monocytes and prevents endothelial activation. However, prolonged TLR2 block induces TNF-α production and leads to exacerbated endothelial activation, indicating that TLR2-mediated responses play an important role not only in the initiation but also the resolution of inflammation. Altogether, these data indicate that the maturation status of the virus has the potential to influence the kinetics and extent of inflammatory responses during DENV infection.

TI  - TLR2 on blood monocytes senses dengue virus infection and its expression correlates with disease pathogenesis
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 11
AB  - Vascular permeability and plasma leakage are immune-pathologies of severe dengue virus (DENV) infection, but the mechanisms underlying the exacerbated inflammation during DENV pathogenesis are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that TLR2, together with its co-receptors CD14 and TLR6, is an innate sensor of DENV particles inducing inflammatory cytokine expression and impairing vascular integrity in vitro. Blocking TLR2 prior to DENV infection in vitro abrogates NF-κB activation while CD14 and TLR6 block has a moderate effect. Moreover, TLR2 block prior to DENV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells prevents activation of human vascular endothelium, suggesting a potential role of the TLR2-responses in vascular integrity. TLR2 expression on CD14 + + classical monocytes isolated in an acute phase from DENV-infected pediatric patients correlates with severe disease development. Altogether, these data identify a role for TLR2 in DENV infection and provide insights into the complex interaction between the virus and innate receptors that may underlie disease pathogenesis. The mechanisms underlying immunpathologies in dengue virus (DENV) infection are incompletely understood. Here, authors show that TLR2 recognizes DENV particles inducing cytokine expression and activating vascular endothelium cells in vitro, and that TLR2 expression on monocytes correlates with disease severity in patients.

TI  - TMEM41B and VMP1 modulate cellular lipid and energy metabolism for facilitating dengue virus infection
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 18
AB  - Transmembrane Protein 41B (TMEM41B) and Vacuole Membrane Protein 1 (VMP1) are two ER-associated lipid scramblases that play a role in autophagosome formation and cellular lipid metabolism. TMEM41B is also a recently validated host factor required by flaviviruses and coronaviruses. However, the exact underlying mechanism of TMEM41B in promoting viral infections remains an open question. Here, we validated that both TMEM41B and VMP1 are essential host dependency factors for all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), but not chikungunya virus (CHIKV). While HCoV-OC43 failed to replicate entirely in both TMEM41B- and VMP1-deficient cells, we detected diminished levels of DENV infections in these cell lines, which were accompanied by upregulation of the innate immune dsRNA sensors, RIG-I and MDA5. Nonetheless, this upregulation did not correspondingly induce the downstream effector TBK1 activation and Interferon-beta expression. Despite low levels of DENV replication, classical DENV replication organelles were undetectable in the infected TMEM41B-deficient cells, suggesting that the upregulation of the dsRNA sensors is likely a consequence of aberrant viral replication rather than a causal factor for reduced DENV infection. Intriguingly, we uncovered that the inhibitory effect of TMEM41B deficiency on DENV replication, but not HCoV-OC43, can be partially reversed using exogenous fatty acid supplements. In contrast, VMP1 deficiency cannot be rescued using the metabolite treatment. In line with the observed phenotypes, we found that both TMEM41B- and VMP1-deficient cells harbor higher levels of compromised mitochondria, especially in VMP1 deficiency which results in severe dysregulations of mitochondrial beta-oxidation. Using a metabolomic profiling approach, we revealed distinctive global dysregulations of the cellular metabolome, particularly lipidome, in TMEM41B- and VMP1-deficient cells. Our findings highlight a central role for TMEM41B and VMP1 in modulating multiple cellular pathways, including lipid mobilization, mitochondrial beta-oxidation, and global metabolic regulations, to facilitate the replication of flaviviruses and coronaviruses.

JF  - Tissue antigens
VL  - 64 4
SP  - 469
EP  - 72
AB  - Among the several hypothesis postulated to explain the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease, the model of immunopathogenesis is the most supported one with a likely important role played by the cascade of cytokines. This work describes single-nucleotide polymorphism of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-6, transforming growth factor-beta1, and IL-10 in patients with dengue virus infections and analyzes their relation with clinical manifestations of the disease. Because cytokine gene polymorphisms affect cytokine production, the significant increase of the TNF-308A allele we have observed among patients with dengue fever (DF) with hemorrhagic manifestations compared to patients with DF only indicates that the former patients are genetically predisposed to express higher levels of TNF-alpha. This finding supports studies reporting a possible association between elevated levels of circulating TNF, vascular permeability, and hemorrhage in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever.

TI  - TRAIL Is a Novel Antiviral Protein against Dengue Virus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 555
EP  - 564
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue fever is an important tropical illness for which there is currently no virus-specific treatment. To shed light on mechanisms involved in the cellular response to dengue virus (DV), we assessed gene expression changes, using Affymetrix GeneChips (HG-U133A), of infected primary human cells and identified changes common to all cells. The common response genes included a set of 23 genes significantly induced upon DV infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, and B cells (analysis of variance, P < 0.05). Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), one of the common response genes, was identified as a key link between type I and type II interferon response genes. We found that DV induces TRAIL expression in immune cells and HUVECs at the mRNA and protein levels. The induction of TRAIL expression by DV was found to be dependent on an intact type I interferon signaling pathway. A significant increase in DV RNA accumulation was observed in anti-TRAIL antibody-treated monocytes, B cells, and HUVECs, and, conversely, a decrease in DV RNA was seen in recombinant TRAIL-treated monocytes. Furthermore, recombinant TRAIL inhibited DV titers in DV-infected DCs by an apoptosis-independent mechanism. These data suggest that TRAIL plays an important role in the antiviral response to DV infection and is a candidate for antiviral interventions against DV.

TI  - TRIM proteins: New players in virus-induced autophagy
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved and intricately regulated cellular process in which damaged or aggregated proteins, organelles, and pathogen-derived components are engulfed by double-membrane structures, termed autophagosomes, and targeted for lysosomal degradation [1]. The autophagic process consists of distinct phases that include nucleation, autophagosome formation, selection of cargo, autophagolysosomal fusion, and cargo degradation. Autophagy induction is governed by a set of kinases, including Unc51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), that activate autophagy via assembly of an essential Beclin-1-containing complex. Conversely, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an important negative regulator of autophagy initiation. A hallmark of autophagic flux is the conversion of the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B (LC3B) from a cytosolic form to a phosphatidylethanolamine-lipidated, membrane-associated form decorating autophagosomes in punctae-like structures. Several forms of autophagy have been identified, including starvation-triggered autophagy, which is a nonspecific autodigestive response, and selective autophagy, in which “tagged” cargos are specifically recognized by sequestosome1 (SQSTM1)-like receptors, such as p62/SQSTM1 or nuclear dot protein 52 (NDP52) [2]. As such, autophagy has been implicated in multiple cellular processes, including stress adaptation, protection against inflammation, neurodegeneration, and antimicrobial activities [3]. Autophagy is induced upon infection by many different viruses from diverse families, yet the impact of the autophagic host response on viral replication is highly virus and cell-type specific [3]. Some viruses or their components are degraded by autophagy, which limits virus replication and thus serves as an antiviral defense pathway. Additionally, autophagosomes can capture viral components and expose pathogen-associated molecular patterns to innate immune sensors (e.g., Toll-like receptors) upon fusion with endosomes, ultimately promoting innate immune recognition and cytokine-mediated host defenses [4]. Among the viruses sensitive to autophagy-mediated clearance are herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), Sindbis virus (SINV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). On the other hand, viruses like encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), dengue virus, and Zika virus subvert autophagy to promote their replication, and inhibition of autophagic flux suppresses the replication of these viruses [5]. Given the important antiviral and proviral roles of autophagy, it is not surprising that many viruses are equipped with sophisticated mechanisms to modulate autophagy in the infected host cell. For example, EMCV induces autophagy through ER stress via its nonstructural proteins 2C and 3D [6], whereas the γ34.5 protein of HSV-1 suppresses autophagy by interacting with Beclin-1 [7]. Furthermore, the M2 protein of influenza A virus (IAV) modulates autophagy by sequestering LC3B to nonautophagosomal membranes, thereby facilitating virion stability [8].

TI  - TRIMming down Flavivirus Infections
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - Flaviviruses comprise a large number of arthropod-borne viruses, some of which are associated with life-threatening diseases. Flavivirus infections are rising worldwide, mainly due to the proliferation and geographical expansion of their vectors. The main human pathogens are mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including dengue virus, Zika virus, and West Nile virus, but tick-borne flaviviruses are also emerging. As with any viral infection, the body’s first line of defense against flavivirus infections is the innate immune defense, of which type I interferon is the armed wing. This cytokine exerts its antiviral activity by triggering the synthesis of hundreds of interferon-induced genes (ISGs), whose products can prevent infection. Among the ISGs that inhibit flavivirus replication, certain tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins have been identified. Although involved in other biological processes, TRIMs constitute a large family of antiviral proteins active on a wide range of viruses. Furthermore, whereas some TRIM proteins directly block viral replication, others are positive regulators of the IFN response. Therefore, viruses have developed strategies to evade or counteract TRIM proteins, and some even hijack certain TRIM proteins to their advantage. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge on the interactions between flaviviruses and TRIM proteins, covering both direct and indirect antiviral mechanisms.

TI  - Temperature modulates immune gene expression in mosquitoes during arbovirus infection
JF  - Open Biology
VL  - 11
AB  - The principal vector of dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses is the mosquito Aedes aegypti, with its ability to transmit pathogens influenced by ambient temperature. We use chikungunya virus (CHIKV) to understand how the mosquito transcriptome responds to arbovirus infection at different ambient temperatures. We exposed CHIKV-infected mosquitoes to 18, 28 and 32°C, and found that higher temperature correlated with higher virus levels, particularly at 3 days post infection, but lower temperature resulted in reduced virus levels. RNAseq analysis indicated significantly altered gene expression levels in CHIKV infection. The highest number of significantly differentially expressed genes was observed at 28°C, with a more muted effect at the other temperatures. At the higher temperature, the expression of many classical immune genes, including Dicer-2, was not substantially altered in response to CHIKV. The upregulation of Toll, IMD and JAK-STAT pathways was only observed at 28°C. Functional annotations suggested that genes in immune response and metabolic pathways related to energy supply and DNA replication were involved in temperature-dependent changes. Time post infection also led to substantially different gene expression profiles, and this varied with temperature. In conclusion, temperature significantly modulates mosquito gene expression in response to infection, potentially leading to impairment of immune defences at higher temperatures.

AB  - Dengue human infection studies present an opportunity to address many longstanding questions in the field of flavivirus biology. However, limited data are available on how the immunological and transcriptional response elicited by an attenuated challenge virus compares to that associated with a wild-type DENV infection. To determine the kinetic transcriptional signature associated with experimental primary DENV-1 infection and to assess how closely this profile correlates with the transcriptional signature accompanying natural primary DENV-1 infection, we utilized scRNAseq to analyze PBMC from individuals enrolled in a DENV-1 human challenge study and from individuals experiencing a natural primary DENV-1 infection. While both experimental and natural primary DENV-1 infection resulted in overlapping patterns of inflammatory gene upregulation, natural primary DENV-1 infection was accompanied with a more pronounced suppression in gene products associated with protein translation and mitochondrial function, principally in monocytes. This suggests that the immune response elicited by experimental and natural primary DENV infection are similar, but that natural primary DENV-1 infection has a more pronounced impact on basic cellular processes to induce a multi-layered anti-viral state.

TI  - Th1-Polarized, Dengue Virus-Activated Human Mast Cells Induce Endothelial Transcriptional Activation and Permeability
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), an arbovirus, strongly activates mast cells (MCs), which are key immune cells for pathogen immune surveillance. In animal models, MCs promote clearance of local peripheral DENV infections but, conversely, also promote pathological vascular leakage when widely activated during systemic DENV infection. Since DENV is a human pathogen, we sought to ascertain whether a similar phenomenon could occur in humans by characterizing the products released by human MCs (huMCs) upon direct (antibody-independent) DENV exposure, using the phenotypically mature huMC line, ROSA. DENV did not productively infect huMCs but prompted huMC release of proteases and eicosanoids and induced a Th1-polarized transcriptional profile. In co-culture and trans-well systems, huMC products activated human microvascular endothelial cells, involving transcription of vasoactive mediators and increased monolayer permeability. This permeability was blocked by MC-stabilizing drugs, or limited by drugs targeting certain MC products. Thus, MC stabilizers are a viable strategy to limit MC-promoted vascular leakage during DENV infection in humans.

VL  - 257 3
SP  - 731
EP  - 7
AB  - The dengue virus NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been detected in the nucleus of virus-infected mammalian cells. We demonstrate here for the first time using in vitro and in vivo assay systems that the 37-amino-acid linker interdomain of NS5 (residues 369 to 405) contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) which is capable of targeting b-galactosidase to the nucleus. Further, we show that the linker is recognized by subunits of the NLS-binding importin complex with an affinity similar to that of the bipartite NLS of the retinoblastoma protein and, in analogous fashion to proteins such as the SV40 large tumor antigen, contains a functional protein kinase CK2 phosphorylation site (threonine 395). Interestingly, this site appears to inhibit NS5 nuclear targeting, probably through a cytoplasmic retention mechanism. The linker may have an important role in targeting NS5 to the nucleus in a regulated manner during the dengue virus infectious cycle.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 1900
EP  - 1905
AB  - ABSTRACT Flaviviruses require complementarity between the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome for RNA replication. For mosquito-borne flaviviruses, the cyclization sequences (CS) and upstream of AUG region (UAR) elements at the genomic termini are necessary for viral RNA replication, and a third motif, the downstream of AUG region (DAR), was recently designated for dengue virus. The 3′ DAR sequence is also part of a hairpin (HP-3′SL), and both complementarity between 5′ and 3′ DAR motifs and formation of the HP-3′SL in the absence of the 5′ end are conserved among mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Using West Nile virus as a model, we demonstrate that 5′-3′ DAR complementarity and HP-3′SL formation are essential for viral RNA replication.

TI  - The 5′ and 3′ Untranslated Regions of the Flaviviral Genome
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 9
AB  - Flaviviruses are enveloped arthropod-borne viruses with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome that can cause serious illness in humans and animals. The 11 kb 5′ capped RNA genome consists of a single open reading frame (ORF), and is flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR). The ORF is a polyprotein that is processed into three structural and seven non-structural proteins. The UTRs have been shown to be important for viral replication and immune modulation. Both of these regions consist of elements that are essential for genome cyclization, resulting in initiation of RNA synthesis. Genome mutation studies have been employed to investigate each component of the essential elements to show the necessity of each component and its role in viral RNA replication and growth. Furthermore, the highly structured 3′UTR is responsible for the generation of subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) that helps the virus evade host immune response, thereby affecting viral pathogenesis. In addition, changes within the 3′UTR have been shown to affect transmissibility between vector and host, which can influence the development of vaccines.

TI  - The 67 kDa laminin receptor: structure, function and role in disease.
JF  - Bioscience reports
VL  - 28 1
SP  - 33
EP  - 48
AB  - The 67LR (67 kDa laminin receptor) is a cell-surface receptor with high affinity for its primary ligand. Its role as a laminin receptor makes it an important molecule both in cell adhesion to the basement membrane and in signalling transduction following this binding event. The protein also plays critical roles in the metastasis of tumour cells. Isolation of the protein from either normal or cancerous cells results in a product with an approx. molecular mass of 67 kDa. This protein is believed to be derived from a smaller precursor, the 37LRP (37 kDa laminin receptor precursor). However, the precise mechanism by which cytoplasmic 37LRP becomes cell-membrane-embedded 67LR is unclear. The process may involve post-translational fatty acylation of the protein combined with either homo- or hetero-dimerization, possibly with a galectin-3-epitope-containing partner. Furthermore, it has become clear that acting as a receptor for laminin is not the only function of this protein. 67LR also acts as a receptor for viruses, such as Sindbis virus and dengue virus, and is involved with internalization of the prion protein. Interestingly, unmodified 37LRP is a ribosomal component and homologues of this protein are found in all five kingdoms. In addition, it appears to be strongly associated with histones in the eukaryotic cell nucleus, although the precise role of these interactions is not clear. Here we review the current understanding of the structure and function of this molecule, as well as highlighting areas requiring further research.

TI  - The Aedes aegypti Toll Pathway Controls Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 4
AB  - Aedes aegypti, the mosquito vector of dengue viruses, utilizes its innate immune system to ward off a variety of pathogens, some of which can cause disease in humans. To date, the features of insects' innate immune defenses against viruses have mainly been studied in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which appears to utilize different immune pathways against different types of viruses, in addition to an RNA interference–based defense system. We have used the recently released whole-genome sequence of the Ae. aegypti mosquito, in combination with high-throughput gene expression and RNA interference (RNAi)-based reverse genetic analyses, to characterize its response to dengue virus infection in different body compartments. We have further addressed the impact of the mosquito's endogenous microbial flora on virus infection. Our findings indicate a significant role for the Toll pathway in regulating resistance to dengue virus, as indicated by an infection-responsive regulation and functional assessment of several Toll pathway–associated genes. We have also shown that the mosquito's natural microbiota play a role in modulating the dengue virus infection, possibly through basal-level stimulation of the Toll immune pathway.

JF  - PLoS Biology
VL  - 20
AB  - The mosquito’s innate immune system defends against a variety of pathogens, and the conserved siRNA pathway plays a central role in the control of viral infections. Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of Dicer2 (Dcr2) or R2d2 resulted in an accumulation of 21-nucleotide viral sequences that was accompanied by a significant suppression of dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) replication, thus indicating the broad-spectrum antiviral response mediated by the siRNA pathway that can be applied for the development of novel arbovirus control strategies. Interestingly, overexpression of Dcr2 or R2d2 regulated the mRNA abundance of a variety of antimicrobial immune genes, pointing to additional functions of DCR2 and R2D2 as well as cross-talk between the siRNA pathway and other immune pathways. Accordingly, transgenic overexpression of Dcr2 or R2d2 resulted in a lesser proliferation of the midgut microbiota and increased resistance to bacterial and fungal infections.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-transmitted single stranded RNA virus belonging to genus Flavivirus. The virus is endemic in the tropical and subtropical countries of the world, causing diseases classified according to symptoms and severity (from mild to severe) as dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. Among a variety of human cell types targeted by DENV, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells are members of innate immunity, capable of mounting rapid inflammatory responses. These cells are also major antigen presenting cells, responsible for activating the adaptive immunity for long-term memory. This paper is an overview of the current understanding of the following mutually affected aspects: DENV structure, viral infectivity, cellular receptors, innate immune response, and adaptive immunity.

TI  - The Biogenesis of Dengue Virus Replication Organelles Requires the ATPase Activity of Valosin-Containing Protein
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - The dengue virus (DENV) causes the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease worldwide. While its incidence is increasing in many countries, there is no approved antiviral therapy currently available. In infected cells, the DENV induces extensive morphological alterations of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to generate viral replication organelles (vRO), which include convoluted membranes (CM) and vesicle packets (VP) hosting viral RNA replication. The viral non-structural protein NS4B localizes to vROs and is absolutely required for viral replication through poorly defined mechanisms, which might involve cellular protein partners. Previous interactomic studies identified the ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a DENV NS4B-interacting host factor in infected cells. Using both pharmacological and dominant-negative inhibition approaches, we show, in this study, that VCP ATPase activity is required for efficient DENV replication. VCP associates with NS4B when expressed in the absence of other viral proteins while in infected cells, both proteins colocalize within large DENV-induced cytoplasmic structures previously demonstrated to be CMs. Consistently, VCP inhibition dramatically reduces the abundance of DENV CMs in infected cells. Most importantly, using a recently reported replication-independent plasmid-based vRO induction system, we show that de novo VP biogenesis is dependent on VCP ATPase activity. Overall, our data demonstrate that VCP ATPase activity is required for vRO morphogenesis and/or stability. Considering that VCP was shown to be required for the replication of other flaviviruses, our results argue that VCP is a pan-flaviviral host dependency factor. Given that new generation VCP-targeting drugs are currently evaluated in clinical trials for cancer treatment, VCP may constitute an attractive broad-spectrum antiviral target in drug repurposing approaches.

TI  - The C-terminal 18 Amino Acid Region of Dengue Virus NS5 Regulates its Subcellular Localization and Contains a Conserved Arginine Residue Essential for Infectious Virus Production
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus NS5 is the most highly conserved amongst the viral non-structural proteins and is responsible for capping, methylation and replication of the flavivirus RNA genome. Interactions of NS5 with host proteins also modulate host immune responses. Although replication occurs in the cytoplasm, an unusual characteristic of DENV2 NS5 is that it localizes to the nucleus during infection with no clear role in replication or pathogenesis. We examined NS5 of DENV1 and 2, which exhibit the most prominent difference in nuclear localization, employing a combination of functional and structural analyses. Extensive gene swapping between DENV1 and 2 NS5 identified that the C-terminal 18 residues (Cter18) alone was sufficient to direct the protein to the cytoplasm or nucleus, respectively. The low micromolar binding affinity between NS5 Cter18 and the nuclear import receptor importin-alpha (Impα), allowed their molecular complex to be purified, crystallised and visualized at 2.2 Å resolution using x-ray crystallography. Structure-guided mutational analysis of this region in GFP-NS5 clones of DENV1 or 2 and in a DENV2 infectious clone reveal residues important for NS5 subcellular localization. Notably, the trans conformation adopted by Pro-884 allows proper presentation for binding Impα and mutating this proline to Thr, as present in DENV1 NS5, results in mislocalizaion of NS5 to the cytoplasm without compromising virus fitness. In contrast, a single mutation to alanine at NS5 position R888, a residue conserved in all flaviviruses, resulted in a completely non-viable virus, and the R888K mutation led to a severely attenuated phentoype, even though NS5 was located in the nucleus. R888 forms a hydrogen bond with Y838 that is also conserved in all flaviviruses. Our data suggests an evolutionarily conserved function for NS5 Cter18, possibly in RNA interactions that are critical for replication, that is independent of its role in subcellular localization.

TI  - The C-terminal 50 Amino Acid Residues of Dengue NS3 Protein Are Important for NS3-NS5 Interaction and Viral Replication*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 290
SP  - 2379
EP  - 2394
AB  - Background: NS3-NS5 interaction is important for the dengue virus life cycle. Results: NS3 residue Asn-570 is essential for its interaction with NS5; mutation in an infectious cDNA abolished virus production and reduced positive-strand RNA synthesis. Conclusion: NS3-NS5 interaction may be required for coordinated positive- and negative-strand RNA synthesis. Significance: NS3-NS5 interaction may be a target for rational design of antiviral drugs. Dengue virus multifunctional proteins NS3 protease/helicase and NS5 methyltransferase/RNA-dependent RNA polymerase form part of the viral replication complex and are involved in viral RNA genome synthesis, methylation of the 5′-cap of viral genome, and polyprotein processing among other activities. Previous studies have shown that NS5 residue Lys-330 is required for interaction between NS3 and NS5. Here, we show by competitive NS3-NS5 interaction ELISA that the NS3 peptide spanning residues 566–585 disrupts NS3-NS5 interaction but not the null-peptide bearing the N570A mutation. Small angle x-ray scattering study on NS3(172–618) helicase and covalently linked NS3(172–618)-NS5(320–341) reveals a rigid and compact formation of the latter, indicating that peptide NS5(320–341) engages in specific and discrete interaction with NS3. Significantly, NS3:Asn-570 to alanine mutation introduced into an infectious DENV2 cDNA clone did not yield detectable virus by plaque assay even though intracellular double-stranded RNA was detected by immunofluorescence. Detection of increased negative-strand RNA synthesis by real time RT-PCR for the NS3:N570A mutant suggests that NS3-NS5 interaction plays an important role in the balanced synthesis of positive- and negative-strand RNA for robust viral replication. Dengue virus infection has become a global concern, and the lack of safe vaccines or antiviral treatments urgently needs to be addressed. NS3 and NS5 are highly conserved among the four serotypes, and the protein sequence around the pinpointed amino acids from the NS3 and NS5 regions are also conserved. The identification of the functionally essential interaction between the two proteins by biochemical and reverse genetics methods paves the way for rational drug design efforts to inhibit viral RNA synthesis.

TI  - The CD133 and CD34 cell types in human umbilical cord blood have the capacity to produce infectious dengue virus particles
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 13
AB  - Although dengue virus (DENV) can establish infections in hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs), there is little information on dengue virus persistent infection in CD34+ and CD133+ cell surface glycoproteins of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). CD34 and CD133 also function as cell–cell adhesion factors, which are present in umbilical cord blood (UCB). In this study, we sought to establish a persistent infection model of DENV infection in UCB using a prolonged period of infection lasting 30 days. Post-infection, the results exhibited a productive and non-productive phase of DENV production. Using a plaque assay, Western blot, and confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that CD133 and CD34 cells are target cells for DENV infection. Moreover, we showed that DENV particles can be recovered from the non-productive phase of DENV-infected CD34 and CD133 cells after co-incubation with Vero cells. We concluded that CD133 and CD34 retain their capacity to produce the infectious virus due to proliferation and their ability to repopulate, as deduced from a BrdU proliferation assay and flow cytometry analysis using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. In summary, the platform to co-culture infected primitive HSCs from their non-productive phase onto Vero cells will give new insights into understanding the DENV dynamics in cell-to-cell transmission and reactivation of the virus.

TI  - The CD225 Domain of IFITM3 Is Required for both IFITM Protein Association and Inhibition of Influenza A Virus and Dengue Virus Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 7837
EP  - 7852
AB  - ABSTRACT The interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) gene is an interferon-stimulated gene that inhibits the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses in vitro and in vivo. IFITM3 is a member of a large protein superfamily, whose members share a functionally undefined area of high amino acid conservation, the CD225 domain. We performed mutational analyses of IFITM3 and identified multiple residues within the CD225 domain, consisting of the first intramembrane domain (intramembrane domain 1 [IM1]) and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL), that are required for restriction of both influenza A virus (IAV) and dengue virus (DENV) infection in vitro. Two phenylalanines within IM1 (F75 and F78) also mediate a physical association between IFITM proteins, and the loss of this interaction decreases IFITM3-mediated restriction. By extension, similar IM1-mediated associations may contribute to the functions of additional members of the CD225 domain family. IFITM3's distal N-terminal domain is also needed for full antiviral activity, including a tyrosine (Y20), whose alteration results in mislocalization of a portion of IFITM3 to the cell periphery and surface. Comparative analyses demonstrate that similar molecular determinants are needed for IFITM3's restriction of both IAV and DENV. However, a portion of the CIL including Y99 and R87 is preferentially needed for inhibition of the orthomyxovirus. Several IFITM3 proteins engineered with rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms demonstrated reduced expression or mislocalization, and these events were associated with enhanced viral replication in vitro, suggesting that possessing such alleles may impact an individual's risk for viral infection. On the basis of this and other data, we propose a model for IFITM3-mediated restriction.

TI  - The Combination of Type I IFN, TNF-α, and Cell Surface Receptor Engagement with Dendritic Cells Enables NK Cells To Overcome Immune Evasion by Dengue Virus
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 193
SP  - 5065
EP  - 5075
AB  - Clinical studies have suggested the importance of the NK cell response against dengue virus (DenV), an arboviral infection that afflicts >50 million individuals each year. However, a comprehensive understanding of the NK cell response against dengue-infected cells is lacking. To characterize cell-contact mechanisms and soluble factors that contribute to the antidengue response, primary human NK cells were cocultured with autologous DenV-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC). NK cells responded by cytokine production and the lysis of target cells. Notably, in the absence of significant monokine production by DenV-infected DC, it was the combination of type I IFNs and TNF-α produced by DenV-infected DC that was important for stimulating the IFN-γ and cytotoxic responses of NK cells. Cell-bound factors enhanced NK cell IFN-γ production. In particular, reduced HLA class I expression was observed on DenV-infected DC, and IFN-γ production was enhanced in licensed/educated NK cell subsets. NK–DC cell contact was also identified as a requirement for a cytotoxic response, and there was evidence for both perforin/granzyme as well as Fas/Fas ligand–dependent pathways of killing by NK cells. In summary, our results have uncovered a previously unappreciated role for the combined effect of type I IFNs, TNF-α, and cell surface receptor–ligand interactions in triggering the antidengue response of primary human NK cells.

TI  - The Complement System in Flavivirus Infections
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - The incidence of flavivirus infections has increased dramatically in recent decades in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, affecting hundreds of millions of people each year. The Flaviviridae family includes dengue, West Nile, Zika, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever viruses that are typically transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks, and cause a wide range of symptoms, such as fever, shock, meningitis, paralysis, birth defects, and death. The flavivirus genome is composed of a single positive-sense RNA molecule encoding a single viral polyprotein. This polyprotein is further processed by viral and host proteases into three structural proteins (C, prM/M, E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) that are involved in viral replication and pathogenicity. The complement system has been described to play an important role in flavivirus infection either by protecting the host and/or by influencing disease pathogenesis. In this mini-review, we will explore the role of complement system inhibition and/or activation against infection by the Flavivirus genus, with an emphasis on dengue and West Nile viruses.

TI  - The Composition of Midgut Bacteria in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) That Are Naturally Susceptible or Refractory to Dengue Viruses
JF  - Journal of Insect Science
VL  - 18
AB  - Abstract The composition, abundance, and diversity of midgut bacteria in mosquitoes can influence pathogen transmission. We used 16S rRNA microbiome profiling to survey midgut microbial diversity in pooled samples of laboratory colonized dengue-refractory, Cali-MIB, and dengue-susceptible, Cali-S Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus). The 16S rRNA sequences from the sugar-fed midguts of adult females clustered to 63 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), primarily from Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Flavobacteria, and Actinobacteria. An average of five ASVs dominated the midguts, and most ASVs were present in both Cali-MIB and Cali-S midguts. No differences in abundance were noted at any phylogenetic level (Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus) by analysis of composition of microbiome (w = 0). No community diversity metrics were significantly different between refractory and susceptible mosquitoes. These data suggest that phenotypic differences in the susceptibility to dengue virus between Cali-MIB and Cali-S are not likely due to major differences in midgut bacterial communities.

TI  - The Compound AT13148 Targeting AKT Suppresses Dengue Virus 2 Replication.
JF  - Vector borne and zoonotic diseases
AB  - Background: Dengue virus (DENV) infection, caused by serotypes DENV 1-4, represents a significant global public health challenge, with no antiviral drugs currently available for treatment. The host Protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway is crucial for DENV infection, presenting a potential target for antiviral drug development. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the antiviral activity of kinase inhibitors that target the AKT pathway, focusing on the compound AT13148. Methods: A mini-screening was conducted to identify kinase inhibitors with antiviral properties against DENV-2. The effects of AT13148 on viral RNA replication and translation were assessed in a dose- and time-dependent manner following DENV-2 entry. The mechanism of action was further investigated by evaluating the impact of AT13148 on AKT kinase activity and phosphorylation status. Results: AT13148 exhibited potent antiviral activity against DENV-2, significantly inhibiting viral RNA replication and translation post-entry. The compound was found to inhibit AKT kinase activity through hyperphosphorylation. Conclusion: The findings indicate that AT13148 effectively targets the AKT pathway, demonstrating potential as an antiviral therapeutic against DENV-2 by interfering with the virus's post-entry processes. Further in vivo studies are warranted to assess the efficacy of AT13148 in controlling DENV infection.

TI  - The Dengue Virus NS5 Protein Intrudes in the Cellular Spliceosome and Modulates Splicing
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus NS5 protein plays multiple functions in the cytoplasm of infected cells, enabling viral RNA replication and counteracting host antiviral responses. Here, we demonstrate a novel function of NS5 in the nucleus where it interferes with cellular splicing. Using global proteomic analysis of infected cells together with functional studies, we found that NS5 binds spliceosome complexes and modulates endogenous splicing as well as minigene-derived alternative splicing patterns. In particular, we show that NS5 alone, or in the context of viral infection, interacts with core components of the U5 snRNP particle, CD2BP2 and DDX23, alters the inclusion/exclusion ratio of alternative splicing events, and changes mRNA isoform abundance of known antiviral factors. Interestingly, a genome wide transcriptome analysis, using recently developed bioinformatics tools, revealed an increase of intron retention upon dengue virus infection, and viral replication was improved by silencing specific U5 components. Different mechanistic studies indicate that binding of NS5 to the spliceosome reduces the efficiency of pre-mRNA processing, independently of NS5 enzymatic activities. We propose that NS5 binding to U5 snRNP proteins hijacks the splicing machinery resulting in a less restrictive environment for viral replication.

TI  - The Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1 (NS1) Interacts with the Putative Epigenetic Regulator DIDO1 to Promote Flavivirus Replication in Mosquito Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease to humans. Dengue virus NS1 is a multifunctional protein essential for replication and modulation of innate immunity. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) NS1 is a multifunctional protein essential for viral replication. To gain insights into NS1 functions in mosquito cells, the protein interactome of DENV NS1 in C6/36 cells was investigated using a proximity biotinylation system and mass spectrometry. A total of 817 mosquito targets were identified as protein–protein interacting with DENV NS1. Approximately 14% of them coincide with interactomes previously obtained in vertebrate cells, including the oligosaccharide transferase complex, the chaperonin containing TCP-1, vesicle localization, and ribosomal proteins. Notably, other protein pathways not previously reported in vertebrate cells, such as epigenetic regulation and RNA silencing, were also found in the NS1 interactome in mosquito cells. Due to the novel and strong interactions observed for NS1 and the epigenetic regulator DIDO1 (Death-Inducer Obliterator 1), the role of DIDO1 in viral replication was further explored. Interactions between NS1 and DIDO1 were corroborated in infected mosquito cells, by colocalization and proximity ligation assays. Silencing DIDO1 expression results in a significant reduction in DENV and ZIKV replication and progeny production. Comparison of transcription analysis of mock or DENV infected cells silenced for DIDO1 revealed variations in multiple gene expression pathways, including pathways associated with DENV infection such as RNA surveillance, IMD, and Toll. These results suggest that DIDO1 is a host factor involved in the negative modulation of the antiviral response necessary for flavivirus replication in mosquito cells. Our findings uncover novel mechanisms of NS1 to promote DENV and ZIKV replication, and add to the understanding of NS1 as a multifunctional protein. IMPORTANCE Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease to humans. Dengue virus NS1 is a multifunctional protein essential for replication and modulation of innate immunity. To gain insights into NS1 functions, the protein interactome of dengue virus NS1 in Aedes albopictus cells was investigated using a proximity biotinylation system and mass spectrometry. Several protein pathways, not previously observed in vertebrate cells, such as transcription and epigenetic regulation, were found as part of the NS1 interactome in mosquito cells. Among those, DIDO1 was found to be a necessary host factor for dengue and Zika virus replication in mosquito cells. Transcription analysis of infected mosquito cells silenced for DIDO1 revealed alterations of the IMD and Toll pathways, part of the antiviral response in mosquitoes. The results suggest that DIDO1 is a host factor involved in modulation of the antiviral response and necessary for flavivirus replication.

TI  - The Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1 (NS1) Is Secreted from Mosquito Cells in Association with the Intracellular Cholesterol Transporter Chaperone Caveolin Complex
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - The dengue virus protein NS1 is secreted efficiently from both infected vertebrate and mosquito cells. Previously, our group reported that NS1 secretion in mosquito cells follows an unconventional secretion pathway dependent on caveolin-1. In this work, we demonstrate that in mosquito cells, but not in vertebrate cells, NS1 secretion takes place in association with the chaperone caveolin complex, a complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, CyA, and Cy40, which are in charge of cholesterol transport inside the cell. Results obtained with ZIKV-infected mosquito cells suggest that ZIKV NS1 is released following an unconventional secretory route in association with the chaperone caveolin complex. These results uncover important differences in the virus-cell interactions between the vertebrate host and the mosquito vector, as well as novel functions for the chaperone caveolin complex. Moreover, manipulation of the NS1 secretory route may prove a valuable strategy to combat these two mosquito-borne diseases. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the family Flaviviridae. The RNA viral genome encodes three structural and seven nonstructural proteins. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional protein actively secreted in vertebrate and mosquito cells during infection. In mosquito cells, NS1 is secreted in a caveolin-1-dependent manner by an unconventional route. The caveolin chaperone complex (CCC) is a cytoplasmic complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, Cy40, and CyA and is responsible for the cholesterol traffic inside the cell. In this work, we demonstrate that in mosquito cells, but not in vertebrate cells, NS1 associates with and relies on the CCC for secretion. Treatment of mosquito cells with classic secretion inhibitors, such as brefeldin A, Golgicide A, and Fli-06, showed no effect on NS1 secretion but significant reductions in recombinant luciferase secretion and virion release. Silencing the expression of CAV-1 or FKBP52 with short interfering RNAs or the inhibition of CyA by cyclosporine resulted in significant decrease in NS1 secretion, again without affecting virion release. Colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays indicated that NS1 colocalizes and interacts with all proteins of the CCC. In addition, CAV-1 and FKBP52 expression was found augmented in DENV-infected cells. Results obtained with Zika virus-infected cells suggest that in mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1 follows the same secretory pathway as that observed for DENV NS1. These results uncover important differences in the dengue virus-cell interactions between the vertebrate host and the mosquito vector as well as novel functions for the chaperone caveolin complex. IMPORTANCE The dengue virus protein NS1 is secreted efficiently from both infected vertebrate and mosquito cells. Previously, our group reported that NS1 secretion in mosquito cells follows an unconventional secretion pathway dependent on caveolin-1. In this work, we demonstrate that in mosquito cells, but not in vertebrate cells, NS1 secretion takes place in association with the chaperone caveolin complex, a complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, CyA, and Cy40, which are in charge of cholesterol transport inside the cell. Results obtained with ZIKV-infected mosquito cells suggest that ZIKV NS1 is released following an unconventional secretory route in association with the chaperone caveolin complex. These results uncover important differences in the virus-cell interactions between the vertebrate host and the mosquito vector, as well as novel functions for the chaperone caveolin complex. Moreover, manipulation of the NS1 secretory route may prove a valuable strategy to combat these two mosquito-borne diseases.

AB  - The function of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in liver injury resulted by dengue virus (DENV) infection have not yet been explored. The differential expression profiles of lncRNAs (as well as mRNAs) in the L-02 liver cells infected by DENV1, DENV2, or uninfected were compared and analyzed after a high throughput RNA seq. The significantly up-regulated and down-regulated lncRNAs (or mRNAs) resulted by DENV infection were identified with a cutoff value at log2 (ratio) ≥ 1.5 and log2 (ratio) ≤ -1.5 (ratio = the reads of the lncRNAs or mRNAs from the infection groups divided by the reads from the control group). Several differentially expressed lncRNAs were verified with reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Target gene analysis, pre-miRNA prediction, and the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network construction were performed to predict the function of the differentially expressed lncRNAs. The differentially expressed lncRNAs were associated with biosynthesis, DNA/RNA related processes, inhibition of estrogen signaling pathway, sterol biosynthetic process, protein dimerization activity, vesicular fraction in DENV1 infection group; and with protein secretion, methyltransferase process, host cell cytoskeleton reorganization and the small GTPase Ras superfamily, inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis in DENV2 infection. LncRNAs might be novel diagnostic markers and targets for further researches on dengue infection and liver injury resulted by dengue virus.

TI  - The Dual Regulation of Apoptosis by Flavivirus
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death, which maintains cellular homeostasis by eliminating pathogen-infected cells. It contains three signaling pathways: death receptor pathway, mitochondria-mediated pathway, and endoplasmic reticulum pathway. Its importance in host defenses is highlighted by the observation that many viruses evade, hinder or destroy apoptosis, thereby weakening the host’s immune response. Flaviviruses such as Dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus utilize various strategies to activate or inhibit cell apoptosis. This article reviews the research progress of apoptosis mechanism during flaviviruses infection, including flaviviruses proteins and subgenomic flaviviral RNA to regulate apoptosis by interacting with host proteins, as well as various signaling pathways involved in flaviviruses-induced apoptosis, which provides a scientific basis for understanding the pathogenesis of flaviviruses and helps in developing an effective antiviral therapy.

TI  - The Dynamic Relationship between Dengue Virus and the Human Cutaneous Innate Immune Response
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a continuing global threat that puts half of the world’s population at risk for infection. This mosquito-transmitted virus is endemic in over 100 countries. When a mosquito takes a bloodmeal, virus is deposited into the epidermal and dermal layers of human skin, infecting a variety of permissive cells, including keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, macrophages, dermal dendritic cells, fibroblasts, and mast cells. In response to infection, the skin deploys an array of defense mechanisms to inhibit viral replication and prevent dissemination. Antimicrobial peptides, pattern recognition receptors, and cytokines induce a signaling cascade to increase transcription and translation of pro-inflammatory and antiviral genes. Paradoxically, this inflammatory environment recruits skin-resident mononuclear cells that become infected and migrate out of the skin, spreading virus throughout the host. The details of the viral–host interactions in the cutaneous microenvironment remain unclear, partly due to the limited body of research focusing on DENV in human skin. This review will summarize the functional role of human skin, the cutaneous innate immune response to DENV, the contribution of the arthropod vector, and the models used to study DENV interactions in the cutaneous environment.

TI  - The Dynamics of NS1 Antigen and Platelet Levels in the Acute Phase of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever
JF  - Sriwijaya Journal of Internal Medicine
AB  - Introduction: Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a significant global health concern, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The early diagnosis and effective management of DHF are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality. The NS1 antigen and platelet count are two key laboratory parameters used in the diagnosis and monitoring of DHF. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of NS1 antigen and platelet levels during the acute phase of DHF and their correlation with disease severity. 
Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Central Java, Indonesia. Patients presenting with suspected DHF were enrolled and followed up during their hospitalization. Blood samples were collected at admission and at regular intervals to measure NS1 antigen levels and platelet counts. Clinical and laboratory data were collected to assess disease severity. 
Results: A total of 150 patients were included in the study. The majority of patients were adults (median age, 32 years) with a female predominance (58%). The median duration of fever at presentation was 4 days. NS1 antigen levels were significantly higher in patients with DHF compared to those with dengue fever (DF) (p < 0.001). Platelet counts were significantly lower in patients with DHF compared to those with DF (p < 0.001). NS1 antigen levels showed a negative correlation with platelet counts (r = -0.62, p < 0.001). The levels of NS1 antigen and platelet count were also significantly associated with disease severity. 
Conclusion: The dynamics of NS1 antigen and platelet levels during the acute phase of DHF provide valuable insights into disease pathogenesis and can aid in the early diagnosis and prediction of disease severity. The negative correlation between NS1 antigen and platelet levels suggests a potential role of NS1 in the development of thrombocytopenia in DHF. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying these observations.

TI  - The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase SIAH1 Targets MyD88 for Proteasomal Degradation During Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - The dengue virus presents a serious threat to human health globally and can cause severe, even life-threatening, illness. Dengue virus (DENV) is endemic on all continents except Antarctica, and it is estimated that more than 100 million people are infected each year. Herein, we further mine the data from a previously described screen for microRNAs (miRNAs) that block flavivirus replication. We use miR-424, a member of the miR-15/16 family, as a tool to further dissect the role of host cell proteins during DENV infection. We observed that miR-424 suppresses expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH1, which is normally induced during dengue virus 2 (DENV2) infection through activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Specific siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIAH1 also results in inhibition of DENV replication, demonstrating that this target is at least partly responsible for the antiviral activity of miR-424. We further show that SIAH1 binds to and ubiquitinates the innate immune adaptor protein MyD88 and that the antiviral effect of SIAH1 knockdown is reduced in cells in which MyD88 has been deleted by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Additionally, MyD88-dependent signaling, triggered either by DENV2 infection or the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) ligand imiquimod, is increased in cells in which SIAH1 has been knocked down by miR-424 or a SIAH1-specific siRNA. These observations suggest an additional pathway by which DENV2 harnesses aspects of the UPR to dampen the host innate immune response and promote viral replication.

TI  - The Electrostatic Features of Dengue Virus Capsid Assembly
JF  - Journal of Computational Biophysics and Chemistry
AB  - Dengue virus causes serious diseases and deaths in the world. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of dengue virus is highly demanded to develop treatments for dengue virus caused diseases. Here, we present a computational work which focused on the stability of dengue viral capsid. The interactions among E proteins on the dengue viral capsid were studied using several computational approaches. It was found that the electrostatic distribution on a single E protein monomer is highly inhomogeneous, which makes an E protein strongly binding with another E protein. This is the reason why all the E proteins form homodimers as the basic units on the whole dengue viral capsids. The pKa calculations of E proteins demonstrated that the folding energy of an E protein is low and stable in the range of pH 6–10, which is different from many other proteins that are stable at certain pH. The pH dependence of binding energy of E protein homodimer shows that the binding energy is low and independent from pH when the pH is also in the range of 6–10. This finding implies that the dengue virus can survive in a wide range of pH, which can explain why the dengue virus is so widely distributed in the world and spreads fast.

AB  - As most of you know, one of the duties of the President of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene specified by the by-laws is the presentation of an address at the annual meet ing. I do not know what type of address those responsible for this provision had in mind, but a review of previous presidential addresses reveals a wide variety both of philosophical and scientific topics. Since I do not feel competent to address you on a philosophical subject, I have chosen to review a scientific topic which has been of interest to me during the past few years. In making this choice, I know that the subject matter will be of relatively little interest to those of you in other fields and for this I apologize. I shall illustrate later, however, that the topic I have chosen is especially appropriate for the site of our gathering this year and for the bicentennial which our joint meeting commemorates. Those of you unfamiliar with recent work and discussions on dengue may be puzzled by the first part of the title of this address. I should like to explain that it was chosen to call attention to what I believe is the transparency of arguments used in support of a widely disseminated hypoth esis on the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic feverâ€”but that it was not intended that the analogy be carried so far as to imply that those who have proposed this hypothesis are the counter parts of the two rogues in Hans Christian Ander sen's story.' There has been considerable speculation as to why dengue, long considered an annoying but benign disease, has in the last 20 years become a leading cause of hospitalization and death among children in a number of Southeast Asian countries.2 The life-threatening forms of dengue usually are associated with hemorrhage, hypovolemic shock,

TI  - The Era of Thromboinflammation: Platelets Are Dynamic Sensors and Effector Cells During Infectious Diseases
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 10
AB  - Platelets are anucleate cells produced by megakaryocytes. In recent years, a robust body of literature supports the evolving role of platelets as key sentinel and effector cells in infectious diseases, especially critical in bridging hemostatic, inflammatory, and immune continuums. Upon intravascular pathogen invasion, platelets can directly sense viral, parasitic, and bacterial infections through pattern recognition receptors and integrin receptors or pathogen: immunoglobulin complexes through Fc and complement receptors—although our understanding of these interactions remains incomplete. Constantly scanning for areas of injury or inflammation as they circulate in the vasculature, platelets also indirectly respond to pathogen invasion through interactions with leukocytes and the endothelium. Following antigen recognition, platelets often become activated. Through a diverse repertoire of mechanisms, activated platelets can directly sequester or kill pathogens, or facilitate pathogen clearance by activating macrophages and neutrophils, promoting neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation, forming platelet aggregates and microthrombi. At times, however, platelet activation may also be injurious to the host, exacerbating inflammation and promoting endothelial damage and thrombosis. There are many gaps in our understandings of the role of platelets in infectious diseases. However, with the emergence of advanced technologies, our knowledge is increasing. In the current review, we mainly discuss these evolving roles of platelets under four different infectious pathogen infections, of which are dengue, malaria, Esterichia coli (E. coli) and staphylococcus aureus S. aureus, highlighting the complex interplay of these processes with hemostatic and thrombotic pathways.

TI  - The F1 Motif of Dengue Virus Polymerase NS5 Is Involved in Promoter-Dependent RNA Synthesis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 5745
EP  - 5756
AB  - ABSTRACT The mechanism by which viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) specifically amplify viral genomes is still unclear. In the case of flaviviruses, a model has been proposed that involves the recognition of an RNA element present at the viral 5′ untranslated region, stem-loop A (SLA), that serves as a promoter for NS5 polymerase binding and activity. Here, we investigated requirements for specific promoter-dependent RNA synthesis of the dengue virus NS5 protein. Using mutated purified NS5 recombinant proteins and infectious viral RNAs, we analyzed the requirement of specific amino acids of the RdRp domain on polymerase activity and viral replication. A battery of 19 mutants was designed and analyzed. By measuring polymerase activity using nonspecific poly(rC) templates or specific viral RNA molecules, we identified four mutants with impaired polymerase activity. Viral full-length RNAs carrying these mutations were found to be unable to replicate in cell culture. Interestingly, one recombinant NS5 protein carrying the mutations K456A and K457A located in the F1 motif lacked RNA synthesis dependent on the SLA promoter but displayed high activity using a poly(rC) template. Promoter RNA binding of this NS5 mutant was unaffected while de novo RNA synthesis was abolished. Furthermore, the mutant maintained RNA elongation activity, indicating a role of the F1 region in promoter-dependent initiation. In addition, four NS5 mutants were selected to have polymerase activity in the recombinant protein but delayed or impaired virus replication when introduced into an infectious clone, suggesting a role of these amino acids in other functions of NS5. This work provides new molecular insights on the specific RNA synthesis activity of the dengue virus NS5 polymerase.

JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 12
AB  - Flaviviruses, including dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), yellow fever (YFV), and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) viruses, pose a significant global emerging threat. With their potential to cause widespread outbreaks and severe health complications, the development of effective vaccines and antiviral therapeutics is imperative. The flaviviral non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is a highly conserved and multifunctional protein that is crucial for viral replication, and the NS5 protein of many flaviviruses has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of interferon (IFN) signalling. In this review, we discuss the functions of NS5, diverse NS5-mediated strategies adopted by flaviviruses to evade the host antiviral response, and how NS5 can be a target for the development of vaccines and antiviral therapeutics.

JF  - Science
VL  - 319

EP  - 1834
AB  - Many viruses go through a maturation step in the final stages of assembly before being transmitted to another host. The maturation process of flaviviruses is directed by the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor membrane protein (prM), turning inert virus into infectious particles. We have determined the 2.2 angstrom resolution crystal structure of a recombinant protein in which the dengue virus prM is linked to the envelope glycoprotein E. The structure represents the prM-E heterodimer and fits well into the cryo–electron microscopy density of immature virus at neutral pH. The pr peptide β-barrel structure covers the fusion loop in E, preventing fusion with host cell membranes. The structure provides a basis for identifying the stages of its pH-directed conformational metamorphosis during maturation, ending with release of pr when budding from the host.

TI  - The Genetic Variant TNFA (rs361525) Is Associated with Increased Susceptibility to Developing Dengue Symptoms.
JF  - Viral immunology
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the causal agent of dengue fever. The symptoms and signs of dengue vary from febrile illness to hemorrhagic syndrome. IFITM3 and TNFA are genes of the innate immune system. Variants IFITM3 (rs12252 T>C) and TNFA (rs1800629 G > A and rs361525 G>A) might alter gene expression and change the course of the disease. Our first objective was to determine whether these variants were associated with the susceptibility and severity of dengue. The second was to assess the association of these variants with each symptom. We studied 272 cases with suspected dengue infection, of which 102 were confirmed dengue cases (DENV+) and 170 were dengue-like cases without DENV infection (DENV-). Samples of 201 individuals from the general population of Mexico were included as a reference. Genotyping was performed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Odds ratios and confidence intervals were calculated using Pearson's chi-square test and later adjusted for age and sex with a binary logistic regression model. Haldane correction is applied when necessary. We found a significantly higher frequency of the A allele of TNFA rs361525 in both the DENV+ and DENV- groups compared with the general population. Focusing on DENV+ and DENV-, the frequency of the A allele of TNFA rs361525 was higher in the DENV+ group. A broad spectrum of symptoms was related to the A allele of both TNFA variants. We conclude that TNFA rs361525 increases the susceptibility to symptomatic dengue but can also be associated with susceptibility to other dengue-like symptoms from unknown causes.

VL  - 5 1
SP  - 227
EP  - 253
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent medically important mosquito-borne virus in the world. Upon DENV infection of a host cell, DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) can be found intracellularly as a monomer, associated with the cell surface as a dimer, and secreted as a hexamer into the bloodstream. NS1 plays a variety of roles in the viral life cycle, particularly in RNA replication and immune evasion of the complement pathway. Over the past several years, key roles for NS1 in the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease have emerged, including direct action of the protein on the vascular endothelium and triggering release of vasoactive cytokines from immune cells, both of which result in endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leak. Importantly, the adaptive immune response generates a robust response against NS1, and its potential contribution to dengue vaccines is also discussed.

TI  - The HLA-DR Expression on Monocytes in Acute Dengue Infection
JF  - 
VL  - 2
AB  - Introduction: Dengue is the most common disease of mosquito-borne infection. According to the World Health Organization, it is estimated that 50 million cases ofdengue infection have been reported annually. Macrophages andmonocyte are thought to play an important role in dengue infection both as primary targets of viral infection and as a source of immunomodulatory cytokines.Whenmonocytes are infected by dengue viruses, it processed the virus by lyses it and expressed the antigen on its surfacemembrane bind together with HLA class II molecules. HLA-DR-expressing monocytes in acute dengue patients especially the intensity is still poorly understood.Measurement of at difference days of infectionwill give an evidence about the role ofmonocytes in dengue pathogenesis Objectives: To observe the kinetics on percentage of HLA-DR expressingmonocytes and themedian of HLA-DR expression intensity in acute dengue infection. Methods: This researchwas an observational type study conducted by cross sectionalmethod towards all the dengue patients in Dr. Sardjito’s General Hospital. Blood samples were drawn from 32 acute dengue infected patients from Day 1 to Day 6th. The HLA-DR expression was measured flow cytometrically using FACS Calibur. Results: The data showed that the mean difference in acute dengue infection from Day 1 to Day 6 is not significant with the p-value larger than 0.05, (p>0.05). Conclusion: The peak level of activated HLA-DR monocyte was at day 2 and then decreasing until day 6. There were no significant changes in percentage of HLA-DR-expressing monocytes from the day 1 to the day 6 and the median intensity of HLA-DR expression in acute dengue infection.

TI  - The Helical Domains of the Stem Region of Dengue Virus Envelope Protein Are Involved in both Virus Assembly and Entry
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 5159
EP  - 5171
AB  - ABSTRACT The envelope (E) of dengue virus (DENV) is a determinant of tropism and virulence. At the C terminus of E protein, there is a stem region containing two amphipathic α-helical domains (EH1 and EH2) and a stretch of conserved sequences in between. The crystal structure of E protein at the postfusion state suggested the involvement of the stem during the fusion; however, the critical domains or residues involved remain unknown. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to replace each of the stem residues at the hydrophobic face with an alanine or proline in a DENV serotype 4 (DENV4) precursor membrane (prM)/E expression construct. Most of the 15 proline mutations at either EH1 or EH2 severely affected the assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs). Radioimmunoprecipitation and membrane flotation assays revealed that EH1 mutations primarily affect prM-E heterodimerization and EH2 mutations affect the membrane binding of the stem. Introducing four proline mutations at either EH1 or EH2 into a DENV2 replicon packaging system greatly affects assembly and entry. Moreover, introducing these mutations into a DENV2 infectious clone confirmed the impairment in assembly and infectivity. Sequencing analysis of adaptive mutations in passage 5 viruses revealed a change to a leucine or wild-type residue at the original site, suggesting the importance of maintaining the helical structure. Collectively, these findings suggest that the EH1 and EH2 domains are involved in both assembly and entry steps of the DENV replication cycle; this feature, together with the high degree of sequence conservation, suggests that the stem region is a potential target of antiviral strategies.

TI  - The Host Factor AUF1 p45 Supports Flavivirus Propagation by Triggering the RNA Switch Required for Viral Genome Cyclization
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 92
AB  - ABSTRACT In previous studies, we showed that the cellular RNA-binding protein AUF1 supports the replication process of the flavivirus West Nile virus. Here we demonstrate that the protein also enables effective proliferation of dengue virus and Zika virus, indicating that AUF1 is a general flavivirus host factor. Further studies demonstrated that the AUF1 isoform p45 significantly stimulates the initiation of viral RNA replication and that the protein's RNA chaperone activity enhances the interactions of the viral 5′UAR and 3′UAR genome cyclization sequences. Most interestingly, we observed that AUF1 p45 destabilizes not only the 3′-terminal stem-loop (3′SL) but also 5′-terminal stem-loop B (SLB) of the viral genome. RNA structure analyses revealed that AUF1 p45 increases the accessibility of defined nucleotides within the 3′SL and SLB and, in this way, exposes both UAR cyclization elements. Conversely, AUF1 p45 does not modulate the fold of stem-loop A (SLA) at the immediate genomic 5′ end, which is proposed to function as a promoter of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). These findings suggest that AUF1 p45, by destabilizing specific stem-loop structures within the 5′ and 3′ ends of the flaviviral genome, assists genome cyclization and concurrently enables the RdRp to initiate RNA synthesis. Our study thus highlights the role of a cellular RNA-binding protein inducing a flaviviral RNA switch that is crucial for viral replication. IMPORTANCE The genus Flavivirus within the Flaviviridae family includes important human pathogens, such as dengue, West Nile, and Zika viruses. The initiation of replication of the flaviviral RNA genome requires a transformation from a linear to a cyclized form. This involves considerable structural reorganization of several RNA motifs at the genomic 5′ and 3′ ends. Specifically, it needs a melting of stem structures to expose complementary 5′ and 3′ cyclization elements to enable their annealing during cyclization. Here we show that a cellular RNA chaperone, AUF1 p45, which supports the replication of all three aforementioned flaviviruses, specifically rearranges stem structures at both ends of the viral genome and in this way permits 5′-3′ interactions of cyclization elements. Thus, AUF1 p45 triggers the RNA switch in the flaviviral genome that is crucial for viral replication. These findings represent an important example of how cellular (host) factors promote the propagation of RNA viruses.

TI  - The Hsf1-sHsp cascade has pan-antiviral activity in mosquito cells
JF  - Communications Biology
VL  - 8
AB  - Aedes mosquitoes transmit pathogenic arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses, putting nearly half the world’s population at risk. Blocking virus replication in mosquitoes is a promising approach to prevent arbovirus transmission, the development of which requires in-depth knowledge of virus-host interactions and mosquito immunity. By integrating multi-omics data, we find that heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) regulates eight small heat shock protein (sHsp) genes within one topologically associated domain in the genome of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. This Hsf1-sHsp cascade acts as an early response against chikungunya virus infection and shows pan-antiviral activity against chikungunya, Sindbis, and dengue virus as well as the insect-specific Agua Salud alphavirus in Ae. aegypti cells and against chikungunya virus and O’nyong-nyong virus in Aedes albopictus and Anopheles gambiae cells, respectively. Our comprehensive in vitro data suggest that Hsf1 could serve as a promising target for the development of novel intervention strategies to limit arbovirus transmission by mosquitoes.

TI  - The Immunopathogenesis of Neurotropic Flavivirus Infection
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - The flavivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family comprises over 70 species, most of which are tickor mosquito-borne. They are single-stranded, plus-sense RNA viruses, responsible for significant human and animal morbidity and mortality on all inhabited continents. Medically important viscerotropic flaviviruses include dengue, found equatorially across the world, and the prototypic yellow fever virus, found in Africa and South America. Neurotropic members include tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in Europe, West Nile virus (WNV) in Africa, parts of Europe and the Indian subcontinent, as well as the USA, St Louis encephalitis virus in the USA, and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) and Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) viruses in Australasia. Many of these have a history of emergence and re-emergence; indeed, following a novel outbreak in 1999 in New York (Lanciotti et al., 1999; CDC, 2010), WNV spread virtually throughout the Americas in less than 10 years and is the most common cause of meningoencephalitis in North America. WNV is now perhaps the most widely spread of all flaviviruses and may comprise 4 or more lineages, based on isolate homologies (C.G. Hayes, 2001; Bakonyi et al., 2005; Vazquez et al., 2010), with Lineage I and II well-defined and of obvious clinical importance in animals and humans (E.B. Hayes et al., 2005; Venter et al., 2009). WNV was first isolated in 1937 in the West Nile region of Uganda (Smithburn et al., 1940). It is a member of the Japanese encephalitis serogroup, together with JEV, Murray Valley and Saint Louis encephalitis viruses (Poidinger et al., 1996). These viruses are usually propagated in a zoonotic cycle between mosquitoes and amplifying hosts, particularly birds (or pigs in the case of JEV), with humans being incidental, since they may not develop high enough virus titres to infect arthropod vectors (C.G. Hayes, 2001). Rare cases of human-to-human WNV transmission have been documented via organ transplants and blood transfusion, as well as vertical transmission to the foetus in utero (Iwamoto et al., 2003; Lindsey et al., 2009). Although less than one percent of WNV infections develop neuroinvasive disease, in some 60% of patients presenting with central nervous system (CNS) symptoms denoting neuroinvasive disease, life-threatening encephalitis supervenes (Samuel & Diamond, 2009).

EP  - 5717
AB  - Mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue, West Nile and chikungunya viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality in human populations. Since current methods are not sufficient to control disease occurrence, novel methods to control transmission of arboviruses would be beneficial. Recent studies have shown that virus infection and transmission in insects can be impeded by co-infection with the bacterium Wolbachia pipientis. Wolbachia is a maternally inherited endosymbiont that is commonly found in insects, including a number of mosquito vector species. In Drosophila, Wolbachia mediates antiviral protection against a broad range of RNA viruses. This discovery pointed to a potential strategy to interfere with mosquito transmission of arboviruses by artificially infecting mosquitoes with Wolbachia. This review outlines research on the prevalence of Wolbachia in mosquito vector species and the impact of antiviral effects in both naturally and artificially Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.

TI  - The Inflammasome Pathway is Activated by Dengue Virus Non-structural Protein 1 and is Protective During Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a medically important flavivirus causing an estimated 50-100 million dengue cases annually, some of whom progress to severe disease. DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected cells and has been implicated as a major driver of dengue pathogenesis by inducing endothelial barrier dysfunction. However, less is known about how DENV NS1 interacts with immune cells and what role these interactions play. Here we report that DENV NS1 can trigger activation of inflammasomes, a family of cytosolic innate immune sensors that respond to infectious and noxious stimuli, in mouse and human macrophages. DENV NS1 induces the release of IL-1β in a caspase-1 dependent manner. Additionally, we find that DENV NS1-induced inflammasome activation is independent of the NLRP3, Pyrin, and AIM2 inflammasome pathways, but requires CD14. Intriguingly, DENV NS1-induced inflammasome activation does not induce pyroptosis and rapid cell death; instead, macrophages maintain cellular viability while releasing IL-1β. Lastly, we show that caspase-1/11-deficient, but not NLRP3-deficient, mice are more susceptible to lethal DENV infection. Together, these results indicate that the inflammasome pathway acts as a sensor of DENV NS1 and plays a protective role during infection.

JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) are arthropod-borne viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae and Togaviridae families, respectively. Infection by both viruses can lead to a mild indistinct fever or even lead to more severe forms of the diseases, which are characterized by a generalized inflammatory state and multiorgan involvement. Infected mothers are considered a high-risk group due to their immunosuppressed state and the possibility of vertical transmission. Thereby, infection by arboviruses during pregnancy portrays a major public health concern, especially in countries where epidemics of both diseases are regular and public health policies are left aside. Placental involvement during both infections has been already described and the presence of either DENV or CHIKV has been observed in constituent cells of the placenta. In spite of that, there is little knowledge regarding the intrinsic earlier immunological mechanisms that are developed by placental cells in response to infection by both arboviruses. Here, we approach some of the current information available in the literature about the exacerbated presence of cells involved in the innate immune defense of the placenta during DENV and CHIKV infections.

AB  - Diseases caused by arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), such as Dengue, West Nile, and Chikungunya, constitute a major global health burden and are increasing in incidence and geographic range. The natural microbiota of insect vectors influences various aspects of host biology, such as nutrition, reproduction, metabolism, and immunity, and recent studies have highlighted the ability of insect-associated bacteria to reduce vector competence for arboviruses and other pathogens. This reduction can occur through mechanisms, such as immune response activation, resource competition, or the production of anti-viral molecules. Studying the interactions between insect vectors and their microbiota is an important step toward developing alternative strategies for arbovirus transmission control.

EP  - 36407
AB  - Dengue virus NS5 protein is a multifunctional RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is essential for virus replication. We have shown previously that the 37- amino acid interdomain spacer sequence (residues369 X 2KKX 14KKKX 11RKX 3 405) of Dengue2 NS5 contains a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS). In this study, β-galactosidase fusion proteins carrying point mutations of the positively charged residues or truncations of the interdomain linker region (residues 369–389 or residues 386–405) were analyzed for nuclear import and importin binding activities to show that the N-terminal part of the linker region (residues 369–389, a/bNLS) is critical for nuclear localization and is recognized with high affinity by the conventional NLS-binding importin α/β heterodimeric nuclear import receptor. We also show that the importin β-binding site (residues 320–368, bNLS) adjacent to the a/bNLS, previously identified by yeast two-hybrid analysis, is functional as an NLS, recognized with high affinity by importin β, and able to target β-galactosidase to the nucleus. Intriguingly, the bNLS is highly conserved among Dengue and related flaviviruses, implying a general role for the region and importin β in the infectious cycle.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 2421
EP  - 2431
AB  - ABSTRACT Interferon (IFN) signaling is initiated by the recognition of viral components by host pattern recognition receptors. Dengue virus (DEN) triggers IFN-β induction through a molecular mechanism involving the cellular RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway. Here we report that the MAVS protein level is reduced in DEN-infected cells and that caspase-1 and caspase-3 cleave MAVS at residue D429. In addition to its well-known function in IFN induction, MAVS is also a proapoptotic molecule that triggers disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspases. Although different domains are required for the induction of cytotoxicity and IFN, caspase cleavage at residue 429 abolished both functions of MAVS. The apoptotic role of MAVS in viral infection and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stimulation was demonstrated in cells with reduced endogenous MAVS expression induced by RNA interference. Even though IFN-β promoter activation was largely suppressed, DEN production was not affected greatly in MAVS knockdown cells. Instead, DEN- and dsRNA-induced cell death and caspase activation were delayed and attenuated in the cells with reduced levels of MAVS. These results reveal a new role of MAVS in the regulation of cell death beyond its well-known function of IFN induction in antiviral innate immunity.

TI  - The Internal Ribosome Entry Site of Dengue Virus mRNA Is Active When Cap-Dependent Translation Initiation Is Inhibited
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), the etiological agent of dengue, a febrile and hemorrhagic disease, infects millions of people per year in tropical and subtropical countries. When infecting cells, DENV induces stress conditions known to inhibit canonical protein synthesis. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. Translation initiation of DENV mRNA can occur by a cap-dependent or a cap-independent mechanism. Two non-mutually exclusive cap-independent mechanisms of translation initiation have been described for DENV mRNA. The first corresponds to a 5′-end-dependent, internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-independent mechanism, while the second relies on IRES-dependent initiation. In this report, we study the recently discovered DENV IRES. The results show that the DENV IRES is functional in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). In accordance, the activity of the DENV IRES was resistant to the cleavage of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) by the Foot-and-mouth disease virus leader protease in RRL. In cells, the DENV IRES exhibited only marginal activity under standard culture conditions. The DENV IRES showed weak activity in HEK 293T cells; however, DENV IRES activity was significantly enhanced in HEK 293T cells expressing Human rhinovirus 2A protease. These findings suggest that the DENV IRES enables viral protein synthesis under conditions that suppress canonical translation initiation. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV), the etiological agent of dengue, a febrile and hemorrhagic disease, infects millions of people per year in tropical and subtropical countries. When infecting cells, DENV induces stress conditions known to inhibit canonical protein synthesis. Under these conditions, DENV mRNA thrives using noncanonical modes of translation initiation. In this study, we characterize the mechanism dependent on an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Here, we describe the activity of the DENV IRES in vitro and cells. We show that in cells, the DENV IRES enables the viral mRNA to translate under conditions that suppress canonical translation initiation.

TI  - The Interplay between Dengue Virus and the Human Innate Immune System: A Game of Hide and Seek
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 7
AB  - With 40% of the world population at risk, infections with dengue virus (DENV) constitute a serious threat to public health. While there is no antiviral therapy available against this potentially lethal disease, the efficacy of the only approved vaccine is not optimal and its safety has been recently questioned. In order to develop better vaccines based on attenuated and/or chimeric viruses, one must consider how the human immune system is engaged during DENV infection. The activation of the innate immunity through the detection of viruses by cellular sensors is the first line of defence against those pathogens. This triggers a cascade of events which establishes an antiviral state at the cell level and leads to a global immunological response. However, DENV has evolved to interfere with the innate immune signalling at multiple levels, hence dampening antiviral responses and favouring viral replication and dissemination. This review elaborates on the interplay between DENV and the innate immune system. A special focus is given on the viral countermeasure mechanisms reported over the last decade which should be taken into consideration during vaccine development.

TI  - The Involvement of Atlastin in Dengue Virus and Wolbachia Infection in Aedes aegypti and Its Regulation by aae-miR-989
JF  - Microbiology Spectrum
VL  - 10
AB  - Atlastin is a protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and has been shown to play a role in replication of flaviviruses in mammalian cells. This study aimed to investigate the role of mosquito Aedes aegypti atlastin (AaATL) in dengue virus replication and maintenance of Wolbachia, an endosymbiotic bacterium, in the mosquito. ABSTRACT Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-shaping atlastin proteins (ATLs) have been demonstrated to play a functional role during flavivirus replication in mammalian cells. For dengue virus (DENV), atlastin is required in the formation of the replication organelles and RNA replication, virion assembly, production of the infectious virus particles, and trafficking or directing the association of vesicle packets with furin. Here, we investigated the involvement of atlastin in DENV replication in the mosquito Aedes aegypti and explored the possibility of its manipulation by the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia to interfere with DENV replication. Results showed the expression of Ae. aegypti atlastin gene (AaATL) was upregulated in DENV-infected Aag2 cells, and its silencing led to reduced DENV replication. Contrary to our assumption that AaATL could be downregulated by Wolbachia, we did not find evidence for that in Wolbachia-infected cell lines, but this was the case in mosquitoes. Further, silencing AaATL did not have any effect on Wolbachia density. Our results also suggest that aae-miR-989 miRNA negatively regulates AaATL. The oversupply of the miRNA mimic led to reduced DENV replication consistent with the positive role of AaATL in DENV replication. Overall, the results favor AaATL’s involvement in DENV replication; however, there is no support that the protein is involved in Wolbachia-mediated DENV inhibition. In addition, the results contribute to discerning further possible overlapping functions of ATLs in mosquitoes and mammalian cells. IMPORTANCE Atlastin is a protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and has been shown to play a role in replication of flaviviruses in mammalian cells. This study aimed to investigate the role of mosquito Aedes aegypti atlastin (AaATL) in dengue virus replication and maintenance of Wolbachia, an endosymbiotic bacterium, in the mosquito. Our results suggest that AaATL facilitates dengue virus replication in mosquito cells, considering silencing the gene led to reductions in virus replication and virion production. Further, AaATL was found to be regulated by a mosquito microRNA, aae-miR-989. Despite an effect on dengue virus, AaATL silencing did not affect Wolbachia replication and maintenance in mosquito cells. The results shed light on the role of atlastins in mosquito-pathogen interactions and their overlapping roles in mosquito and mammalian cells.

TI  - The Involvement of Neuroinflammation in Dengue Viral Disease: Importance of Innate and Adaptive Immunity
JF  - Neuroimmunomodulation
VL  - 26
SP  - 111
EP  - 118
AB  - Neuroinflammation (inflammation in brain) has been known to play an important role in the development of dengue virus disease. Recently, studies from both clinical and experimental models suggest the involvement of neuroinflammation in dengue viral disease. Studies in clinical setup demonstrated that, microglial cells are actively involved in the patients having dengue virus infection, showing involvement of innate immune response in neuroinflammation. It was further proved that, clinical isolates of dengue-2 virus were able to initiate the pathologic response when injected in the mice brain. Natural killer cells were also found to play a crucial role to activate adaptive immune response. Notably, CXCL10/IFN-inducible protein 10 and CXCR3 are involved in dengue virus-mediated pathogenesis and play an important role in the development of dengue virus-mediated paralysis. In a latest report, it was seen that intracranial injection of dengue virus increases the CD8+ T-cell infiltration in brain, showing an important mechanism of neuroinflammation during the dengue virus infection. A similar study has described that, when DENV-3 is injected into the mice, it enhances the infiltration of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells as well as neutrophils. Cells immune-reactive against NS3 antigen were found throughout the brain. In conclusion, we focus on the various molecular mechanisms which contribute to the basic understanding about the role of neuroinflammation in dengue fever. These mechanisms will help in better understanding dengue pathophysiology and thus help in the development of possible therapeutics.

TI  - The Janus face of proliferating plasmablasts in dengue and COVID-19 infections
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 14
AB  - Introduction B cells play an integral role in the immune response to both dengue fever and COVID-19. Prior scRNAseq analyses of peripheral plasmablasts in COVID-19 have revealed a heterogeneous population with distinct cell subsets associated with proliferation; prior studies in patients with dengue fever have likewise shown the presence of proliferative pre-plasmablasts in the circulation. These findings may have implications for disease severity. In this study, we sought to gain a mechanistic understanding of the intracellular processes in naive and memory B cells that are associated with and may lead to an expanded proliferative plasmablast population in the circulation. Methods We analyzed age-controlled (pediatric and adult), peripheral blood mononuclear cell scRNAseq datasets from patients infected with either dengue (primary or secondary) or COVID-19 (non-severe or severe) from previously published studies. Our preliminary analysis showed that pediatric patients with dengue and adults with COVID-19 had an expanded proliferative plasmablast (p-PB) population. By contrast, neither the adults with dengue nor the children with COVID-19 in our dataset had p-PBs. We used this distinctive preliminary signature to guide our analyses design and expanded our analyses to naive and memory B cells. Results In age/disease conditions with and without p-PBs, we found differences in cell sensing and activation, including via the B cell receptor and downstream signal transduction. Likewise, inflammation was mediated differently: relative to groups without p-PBs, those with p-PBs had increased expression of interferon response and S100 genes (particularly severe COVID-19). Furthermore, several transcription factors at the nexus of activation, inflammation, and cell fate decisions were expressed differently in groups with and without p-PBs. Discussion We used dengue and COVID-19 infections in adult and pediatric patients (focusing on naive B, memory B, and plasmablast cells) as a model to better understand the mechanisms that may give rise to p-PB populations in the circulation. Our results indicate that a more pro-inflammatory state in naive and memory B cells correlated with - and could influence the generation of- proliferating plasmablasts. Further exploration of these mechanisms will have implications for immune memory, vaccine development, and post-viral autoimmune syndromes.

TI  - The Kinase Inhibitor SFV785 Dislocates Dengue Virus Envelope Protein from the Replication Complex and Blocks Virus Assembly
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 6
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the etiologic agent for dengue fever, for which there is no approved vaccine or specific anti-viral drug. As a remedy for this, we explored the use of compounds that interfere with the action of required host factors and describe here the characterization of a kinase inhibitor (SFV785), which has selective effects on NTRK1 and MAPKAPK5 kinase activity, and anti-viral activity on Hepatitis C, DENV and yellow fever viruses. SFV785 inhibited DENV propagation without inhibiting DENV RNA synthesis or translation. The compound did not cause any changes in the cellular distribution of non-structural 3, a protein critical for DENV RNA synthesis, but altered the distribution of the structural envelope protein from a reticulate network to enlarged discrete vesicles, which altered the co-localization with the DENV replication complex. Ultrastructural electron microscopy analyses of DENV-infected SFV785-treated cells showed the presence of viral particles that were distinctly different from viable enveloped virions within enlarged ER cisternae. These viral particles were devoid of the dense nucleocapsid. The secretion of the viral particles was not inhibited by SFV785, however a reduction in the amount of secreted infectious virions, DENV RNA and capsid were observed. Collectively, these observations suggest that SFV785 inhibited the recruitment and assembly of the nucleocapsid in specific ER compartments during the DENV assembly process and hence the production of infectious DENV. SFV785 and derivative compounds could be useful biochemical probes to explore the DENV lifecycle and could also represent a new class of anti-virals.

TI  - The Length of and Nonhydrophobic Residues in the Transmembrane Domain of Dengue Virus Envelope Protein Are Critical for Its Retention and Assembly in the Endoplasmic Reticulum
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 4782
EP  - 4797
AB  - ABSTRACT The morphogenesis of many enveloped viruses, in which viral nucleocapsid complex interacts with envelope (E) protein, is known to take place at various sites along the secretory pathway. How viral E protein retains in a particular intracellular organelle for assembly remains incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated determinants in the E protein of dengue virus (DENV) for its retention and assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A chimeric experiment between CD4 and DENV precursor membrane/E constructs suggested that the transmembrane domain (TMD) of E protein contains an ER retention signal. Substitutions of three nonhydrophobic residues at the N terminus of the first helix (T1) and at either the N or C terminus of the second helix of the TMD with three hydrophobic residues, as well as an increase in the length of T1, led to the release of chimeric CD4 and E protein from the ER, suggesting that short length and certain nonhydrophobic residues of the TMD are critical for ER retention. The analysis of enveloped viruses assembled at the plasma membrane and of those assembled in the Golgi complex and ER revealed a trend of decreasing length and increasing nonhydrophobic residues of the TMD of E proteins. Taken together, these findings support a TMD-dependent sorting for viral E proteins along the secretory pathway. Moreover, similar mutations introduced into the TMD of DENV E protein resulted in the increased production of virus-like particles (VLPs), suggesting that modifications of TMD facilitate VLP production and have implications for utilizing flaviviral VLPs as serodiagnostic antigens and vaccine candidates.

TI  - The Lethal(2)-Essential-for-Life [L(2)EFL] Gene Family Modulates Dengue Virus Infection in Aedes aegypti
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 21
AB  - Efforts to determine the mosquito genes that affect dengue virus replication have identified a number of candidates that positively or negatively modify amplification in the invertebrate host. We used deep sequencing to compare the differential transcript abundances in Aedes aegypti 14 days post dengue infection to those of uninfected A. aegypti. The gene lethal(2)-essential-for-life [l(2)efl], which encodes a member of the heat shock 20 protein (HSP20) family, was upregulated following dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) infection in vivo. The transcripts of this gene did not exhibit differential accumulation in mosquitoes exposed to insecticides or pollutants. The induction and overexpression of l(2)efl gene products using poly(I:C) resulted in decreased DENV-2 replication in the cell line. In contrast, the RNAi-mediated suppression of l(2)efl gene products resulted in enhanced DENV-2 replication, but this enhancement occurred only if multiple l(2)efl genes were suppressed. l(2)efl homologs induce the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and we confirmed this finding in the cell line. However, the mechanism by which l(2)efl phosphorylates eIF2α remains unclear. We conclude that l(2)efl encodes a potential anti-dengue protein in the vector mosquito.

TI  - The Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1 Is Essential for Dengue Virus Infection.
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16 11
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes the most prevalent and rapidly spreading arboviral disease of humans. It enters human cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Numerous cell-surface proteins were proposed as DENV entry factors. Among these, the phosphatidylserine receptor TIM-1 is the only one known to mediate virus internalization. However, several cellular models lacking TIM-1 are permissive to DENV infection, suggesting that other receptors exist. Here, we show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) binds DENV virions by interacting with the DIII of the viral envelope glycoprotein. DENV infection is effectively inhibited by the purified receptor at 5 × 10-8 mol/L, and the interaction of the envelope protein with LRP1 is also blocked by a natural ligand of LRP1. The depletion of LRP1 causes 100-fold lower production of infectious virus than controls. Our results indicate that LRP1 is another DENV receptor, thus becoming an attractive target to evaluate for the development of effective antiviral drugs against DENV.

TI  - The Magnitude of Dengue Virus NS1 Protein Secretion Is Strain Dependent and Does Not Correlate with Severe Pathologies in the Mouse Infection Model
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 5508
EP  - 5514
AB  - ABSTRACT There are conflicting data on the relationship between the level of secreted NS1 (sNS1), viremia, and disease severity upon dengue virus (DENV) infection in the clinical setting, and therefore, we examined this relationship in the widely accepted AG129 mouse model. Because of the failure of a routinely used NS1 detection kit to detect sNS1 of the mouse-adapted DENV2 strain, we screened 15 previously undescribed NS1 monoclonal antibodies and developed a robust capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with detection sensitivity at the low nanogram level (0.2 ng/ml) using recombinant baculovirus-expressed sNS1 as well as sNS1 that was immunoaffinity purified from the various DENV2 strains employed in this study. Using this test, we demonstrated that increased viremia paralleled severe pathologies; however, sNS1 level did not correlate with viremia or severity. Furthermore, among the DENV2 strains that were tested, the level of NS1 secretion did not correspond to virus replication rate in vitro, at the cellular level. Together, our data indicate that the magnitude of NS1 secretion appears to be strain dependent and does not correlate with viral virulence in the AG129 mouse model.

TI  - The Manifold Roles of Sphingolipids in Viral Infections
JF  - Frontiers in Physiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Sphingolipids are essential components of eukaryotic cells. In this review, we want to exemplarily illustrate what is known about the interactions of sphingolipids with various viruses at different steps of their replication cycles. This includes structural interactions during entry at the plasma membrane or endosomal membranes, early interactions leading to sphingolipid-mediated signal transduction, interactions with internal membranes and lipids during replication, and interactions during virus assembly and budding. Targeted interventions in sphingolipid metabolism – as far as they can be tolerated by cells and organisms – may open novel possibilities to support antiviral therapies. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections have intensively been studied, but for other viral infections, such as influenza A virus (IAV), measles virus (MV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus, Ebola virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), investigations are still in their beginnings. As many inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism are already in clinical use against other diseases, repurposing studies for applications in some viral infections appear to be a promising approach.

TI  - The Mannose Receptor Mediates Dengue Virus Infection of Macrophages
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 4
AB  - Macrophages (MØ) and mononuclear phagocytes are major targets of infection by dengue virus (DV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus that can cause haemorrhagic fever in humans. To our knowledge, we show for the first time that the MØ mannose receptor (MR) binds to all four serotypes of DV and specifically to the envelope glycoprotein. Glycan analysis, ELISA, and blot overlay assays demonstrate that MR binds via its carbohydrate recognition domains to mosquito and human cell–produced DV antigen. This binding is abrogated by deglycosylation of the DV envelope glycoprotein. Surface expression of recombinant MR on NIH3T3 cells confers DV binding. Furthermore, DV infection of primary human MØ can be blocked by anti-MR antibodies. MR is a prototypic marker of alternatively activated MØ, and pre-treatment of human monocytes or MØ with type 2 cytokines (IL-4 or IL-13) enhances their susceptibility to productive DV infection. Our findings indicate a new functional role for the MR in DV infection.

TI  - The Many Faces of the Flavivirus NS5 Protein in Antagonism of Type I Interferon Signaling
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT The vector-borne flaviviruses cause severe disease in humans on every inhabited continent on earth. Their transmission by arthropods, particularly mosquitoes, facilitates large emergence events such as witnessed with Zika virus (ZIKV) or West Nile virus in the Americas. Every vector-borne flavivirus examined thus far that causes disease in humans, from dengue virus to ZIKV, antagonizes the host type I interferon (IFN-I) response by preventing JAK-STAT signaling, suggesting that suppression of this pathway is an important determinant of infection. The most direct and potent viral inhibitor of this pathway is the nonstructural protein NS5. However, the mechanisms utilized by NS5 from different flaviviruses are often quite different, sometimes despite close evolutionary relationships between viruses. The varied mechanisms of NS5 as an IFN-I antagonist are also surprising given that the evolution of NS5 is restrained by the requirement to maintain function of two enzymatic activities critical for virus replication, the methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This review discusses the different strategies used by flavivirus NS5 to evade the antiviral effects of IFN-I and how this information can be used to better model disease and develop antiviral countermeasures.

This sequence element connects the ectodomain to the membrane anchor, and its structure in the trimeric postfusion conformation is still poorly defined. Using E trimers of tick-borne encephalitis virus with stem truncations of different lengths, we show that the N-terminal part of the stem increases trimer stability and also modulates the trimer structure outside the stem interaction site.

TI  - The Molecular Interactions of ZIKV and DENV with the Type-I IFN Response
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 8
AB  - Zika Virus (ZIKV) and Dengue Virus (DENV) are related viruses of the Flavivirus genus that cause significant disease in humans. Existing control measures have been ineffective at curbing the increasing global incidence of infection for both viruses and they are therefore prime targets for new vaccination strategies. Type-I interferon (IFN) responses are important in clearing viral infection and for generating efficient adaptive immune responses towards infection and vaccination. However, ZIKV and DENV have evolved multiple molecular mechanisms to evade type-I IFN production. This review covers the molecular interactions, from detection to evasion, of these viruses with the type-I IFN response. Additionally, we discuss how this knowledge can be exploited to improve the design of new vaccine strategies.

TI  - The Mosquito Immune System and the Life of Dengue Virus: What We Know and Do Not Know
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 8
AB  - Flaviviruses are largely transmitted to humans by their arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes or ticks. The dengue virus (DENV) is one of the members of the family Flaviviridae and is the causative agent of dengue fever. In the mosquito vector, DENV enters through viremic blood meal and replicates in the mid-gut. Newly formed virion particles circulate to various mosquito organs and get transmitted to the next host in subsequent bites. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus have intricate immune control to allow DENV production at a sub-pathogenic level. In the mosquito, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and RNA inference (RNAi) are the two main antiviral strategies used against DENV. Apart from innate immunity, mosquito resident microbes play a significant role in modulating DENV replication. In this review, we discuss different immune mechanisms and preventive strategies that act against DENV in two of its vectors: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.

TI  - The Multifaceted Roles of Autophagy in Flavivirus-Host Interactions
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 19
AB  - Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process in which intracellular components are eliminated via lysosomal degradation to supply nutrients for organelle biogenesis and metabolic homeostasis. Flavivirus infections underlie multiple human diseases and thus exert an immense burden on public health worldwide. Mounting evidence indicates that host autophagy is subverted to modulate the life cycles of flaviviruses, such as hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The diverse interplay between autophagy and flavivirus infection not only regulates viral growth in host cells but also counteracts host stress responses induced by viral infection. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of autophagy in the flavivirus life cycle. We also discuss the impacts of virus-induced autophagy on the pathogeneses of flavivirus-associated diseases and the potential use of autophagy as a therapeutic target for curing flavivirus infections and related human diseases.

TI  - The Multiples Fates of the Flavivirus RNA Genome During Pathogenesis
JF  - Frontiers in Genetics
VL  - 9
AB  - The Flavivirus genus comprises many viruses (including dengue, Zika, West Nile and yellow fever viruses) which constitute important public health concerns worldwide. For several of these pathogens, neither antivirals nor vaccines are currently available. In addition to this unmet medical need, flaviviruses are of particular interest since they constitute an excellent model for the study of spatiotemporal regulation of RNA metabolism. Indeed, with no DNA intermediate or nuclear step, the flaviviral life cycle entirely relies on the cytoplasmic fate of a single RNA species, namely the genomic viral RNA (vRNA) which contains all the genetic information necessary for optimal viral replication. From a single open reading frame, the vRNA encodes a polyprotein which is processed to generate the mature viral proteins. In addition to coding for the viral polyprotein, the vRNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis and is also selectively packaged into newly assembled viral particles. Notably, vRNA translation, replication and encapsidation must be tightly coordinated in time and space via a fine-tuned equilibrium as these processes cannot occur simultaneously and hence, are mutually exclusive. As such, these dynamic processes involve several vRNA secondary and tertiary structures as well as RNA modifications. Finally, the vRNA can be detected as a foreign molecule by cytosolic sensors which trigger upon activation antiviral signaling pathways and the production of antiviral factors such as interferons and interferon-stimulated genes. However, to create an environment favorable to infection, flaviviruses have evolved mechanisms to dampen these antiviral processes, notably through the production of a specific vRNA degradation product termed subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA). In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the fates of flavivirus vRNA and how this is regulated at the molecular level to achieve an optimal replication within infected cells.

TI  - The Murine Charged Multivesicular Body Protein 2A, CHMP2A Interacts with the 5' and 3' Terminal Regions of Dengue Virus Complementary Minus-strand RNA
JF  - American Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 2
SP  - 18
EP  - 27
AB  - Dengue (DEN) viruses, of which there are four distinct serotypes (DEN-1, -2, -3 and –4), belong to the Flaviviridae family. Their ‘plus’ sense RNA genomes contain Non-Translated Regions (NTRs) at their 5’ and 3’ ends. Replication of viral genomic RNA, which takes place in close association with host cell membranes, involves the initial synthesis of the complementary minus sense RNA intermediate. The NTRs, which have the potential to form stable stem-loop structures, are implicated to play a key role in the viral life cycle through binding to viral and/or host proteins. We have screened a mouse macrophage cDNA expression library with a mixture of radioactive plus and minus sense DEN-2 virus NTR transcripts and identified a ~25 kDa protein. A BLAST analysis of the cDNA sequence encoding this protein showed it to be identical to human CHarged Multivesicular body Protein 2A, CHMP2A (also known as CHromatin Modifying Protein 2A), implicated in sorting proteins into endosome-derived vesicles. Recombinant murine CHMP2A was expressed in E. coli as a 6x His tagged protein, purified to homogeneity and shown to interact preferentially with the minus sense 5’ and 3’ NTRs of all four DEN virus serotypes. Using DEN-2 virus 5’ (-) and 3’ (-) NTRs we could demonstrate the specificity of this binding activity in vitro by ultraviolet cross-linking and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, carried out in the absence and presence of specific and non-specific competitors. Finally, this unique RNA/protein interaction was verified in vivo using a yeast-based interaction assay.

TI  - The NS1 Glycoprotein Can Generate Dramatic Antibody-Enhanced Dengue Viral Replication in Normal Out-Bred Mice Resulting in Lethal Multi-Organ Disease
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 6
AB  - Antibody-enhanced replication (AER) of dengue type-2 virus (DENV-2) strains and production of antibody-enhanced disease (AED) was tested in out-bred mice. Polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) generated against the nonstructural-1 (NS1) glycoprotein candidate vaccine of the New Guinea-C (NG-C) or NSx strains reacted strongly and weakly with these antigens, respectively. These PAbs contained the IgG2a subclass, which cross-reacted with the virion-associated envelope (E) glycoprotein of the DENV-2 NSx strain, suggesting that they could generate its AER via all mouse Fcγ-receptor classes. Indeed, when these mice were challenged with a low dose (<0.5 LD50) of the DENV-2 NSx strain, but not the NG-C strain, they all generated dramatic and lethal DENV-2 AER/AED. These AER/AED mice developed life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), displayed by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) resulting from i) dramatic interstitial alveolar septa-thickening with mononuclear cells, ii) some hyperplasia of alveolar type-II pneumocytes, iii) copious intra-alveolar protein secretion, iv) some hyaline membrane-covered alveolar walls, and v) DENV-2 antigen-positive alveolar macrophages. These mice also developed meningo-encephalitis, with greater than 90,000-fold DENV-2 AER titers in microglial cells located throughout their brain parenchyma, some of which formed nodules around dead neurons. Their spleens contained infiltrated megakaryocytes with DENV-2 antigen-positive red-pulp macrophages, while their livers displayed extensive necrosis, apoptosis and macro- and micro-steatosis, with DENV-2 antigen-positive Kuppfer cells and hepatocytes. Their infections were confirmed by DENV-2 isolations from their lungs, spleens and livers. These findings accord with those reported in fatal human “severe dengue” cases. This DENV-2 AER/AED was blocked by high concentrations of only the NG-C NS1 glycoprotein. These results imply a potential hazard of DENV NS1 glycoprotein-based vaccines, particularly against DENV strains that contain multiple mutations or genetic recombination within or between their DENV E and NS1 glycoprotein-encoding genes. The model provides potential for assessing DENV strain pathogenicity and anti-DENV therapies in normal mice.

TI  - The NS4A Proteins from 4 Dengue Serotypes, Substantially Different in Sequence, Function Similarly to Induce Autophagy and Protect Mammalian Cells using ATM Pathways
JF  - 
VL  - 4
AB  - There are five serotypes of dengue, a lethal arbovirus that can potentially infect half of humanity. Infection by more than one serotype can produce Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) with devastating consequences. We previously showed that the ability of dengue 2 to induce autophagy is important to the survival of the infected cell and persistence of the virus in the host. Here we evaluate the homology of all 4 dengue serotypes known to infect humans and find that they can trigger autophagy in canine kidney (MDCK) cells and protect infected cells from toxic insults such as Camptothecin (CPT). Thus even though they differ in amino acid sequences they are functionally the same. As is true for the whole virus, NS4A from DEN2 induces autophagy and protects cells by activating ATM. This may be a means by which dengue persists in patients after the acute infection has subsided. All serotypes appear to use the same mechanism.

TI  - The Non-structural Protein 4A of Dengue Virus Is an Integral Membrane Protein Inducing Membrane Alterations in a 2K-regulated Manner*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 282
SP  - 8873
EP  - 8882
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) is a positive sense RNA virus replicating in the cytoplasm in membranous compartments that are induced by viral infection. The non-structural protein (NS) 4A is one of the least characterized DV proteins. It is highly hydrophobic with its C-terminal region (designated 2K fragment) serving as a signal sequence for the translocation of the adjacent NS4B into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. In this report, we demonstrate that NS4A associates with membranes via 4 internal hydrophobic regions, which are all able to mediate membrane targeting of a cytosolic reporter protein. We also developed a model for the membrane topology of NS4A in which the N-terminal third of NS4A localizes to the cytoplasm, while the remaining part contains three transmembrane segments, with the C-terminal end localized in the ER lumen. Subcellular localization experiments in DV-infected cells revealed that NS4A resides primarily in ER-derived cytoplasmic dot-like structures that also contain dsRNA and other DV proteins, suggesting that NS4A is a component of the membrane-bound viral replication complex (RC). Interestingly, the individual expression of DV NS4A lacking the 2K fragment resulted in the induction of cytoplasmic membrane alterations resembling virus-induced structures, whereas expression of full-length NS4A does not induce comparable membrane alterations. Thus, proteolytic removal of the 2K peptide appears to be important for induction of membrane alterations that may harbor the viral RC. These results shed new light on the role of NS4A in the DV replication cycle and provide a model of how this protein induces membrane rearrangements and how this property may be regulated.

TI  - The Nonstructural Proteins 3 and 5 from Flavivirus Modulate Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Transport and Innate Immune Response Targeting Nuclear Proteins
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Viruses hijack cellular proteins and components to be replicated in the host cell and to evade the immune response. Although flaviviruses have a cytoplasmic replicative cycle, some viral proteins such as the capsid (C) and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, NS5, can reach the nucleus of the infected cells. Considering the important roles of NS5 in viral replication and in the control of the immune response, and its striking presence in the nucleus, the possible functions of this protein in some mechanisms orchestrated by the nucleus was analyzed. We isolated and identified nuclear proteins that interact with NS5; one of them, the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 is relocated to the cytoplasm and degraded during infection with DENV, which correlates with its function in IFN dependent response. Since DDX5 and many other proteins are relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during flavivirus infection, the integrity and function of the main regulator of the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, the nuclear pore complex (NPC) was evaluated. We found that during DENV and ZIKV infection nucleoporins (NUPs) such as TPR, Nup153, Nup98, and Nup62 were cleavaged/degraded. The protease NS2B-NS3 induces NUPs degradation and it causes a dramatic inhibition of mature mRNAs export to the cytoplasm but not the export of DDX5 protein, which is dependent on NS5. Here we describe for the first time that the NS3 and NS5 proteins from flavivirus play novel functions hijacking the NPC and some nuclear proteins relevant in triggering immune response pathways, inducing a favorable environment for viral replication. IMPORTANCE Viruses, as intracellular obligate parasites, hijack cellular components to enter and replicate in infected cells. Remarkably, in many cases, viruses hijack molecules with crucial functions for the cells. Here it is described how RNA viruses such as DENV and ZIKV, with a cytoplasmic replicative cycle, use NS3 and NS5, two of their unique non-structural proteins with enzymatic activity, to modulate nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. We found that NS3 disrupts the nuclear pore complex, the main regulator in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, causing a strong reduction in the amount of mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm and an inhibition in innate immune response. Additionally, NS5 induces the relocation of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm such as DDX5, involved in immune response, which is later degraded by NS3. These findings allow the understanding of crucial mechanisms that viruses use to deal with the control of the immune response to grant the production of new viral particles.

TI  - The Nuclear Pore Complex: A Target for NS3 Protease of Dengue and Zika Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - During flavivirus infection, some viral proteins move to the nucleus and cellular components are relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Thus, the integrity of the main regulator of the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, the nuclear pore complex (NPC), was evaluated during infection with dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). We found that while during DENV infection the integrity and distribution of at least three nucleoporins (Nup), Nup153, Nup98, and Nup62 were altered, during ZIKV infection, the integrity of TPR, Nup153, and Nup98 were modified. In this work, several lines of evidence indicate that the viral serine protease NS2B3 is involved in Nups cleavage. First, the serine protease inhibitors, TLCK and Leupeptin, prevented Nup98 and Nup62 cleavage. Second, the transfection of DENV and ZIKV NS2B3 protease was sufficient to inhibit the nuclear ring recognition detected in mock-infected cells with the Mab414 antibody. Third, the mutant but not the active (WT) protease was unable to cleave Nups in transfected cells. Thus, here we describe for the first time that the NS3 protein from flavivirus plays novel functions hijacking the nuclear pore complex, the main controller of the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport.

TI  - The Pathogenesis and Immune-Response in Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever
JF  - Asian Journal of Research in Infectious Diseases
AB  - Introduction: Dengue fever has spread to be endemic in addition of 100 countries to a total estimate incidence of 50 – 100 million cases annually globally. About 0.7% of these cases become the complication that is dengue hemorrhagic fever which is severe and leads to about 22,000 deaths annually. 
The pathogenesis of benign dengue fever becoming dengue hemorrhagic fever, and aspects of the immune-response behind it, have remained relatively unknown. 
Methods: Existing literature on the Topic was retrieved through Google Scholar and PubMed searches, and the literature reviewed. 
Results: Dengue hemorrhagic fever appears commoner in females and those with co-morbids such as diabetes-mellitus and obesity. Also, the case-fatality rate in severe dengue appears much bigger in females. The reasons for this are largely unknown but the additionally robust immune response in females, resulting in females to be additionally prone to develop bigger inflammatory response or enhanced susceptibility to capillary permeability could be the reason. 
It has been shown that viremic-load, including the initial viremic-load at the bite of the Aedes-mosquito may be a factor leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever. 
Yet different factors felt to be causative in the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever include the role of the viral-protein, and then that which is termed the original antigenic-sin, the antibody-directed enhancement, autoimmunity, inhibition of interferon-alpha and cytokine-storm within the memory-cells. 
Regionally, certain different strains of the DENV also seem to be associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever. 
Newer-vaccines, based on the immunology of the disease, offer much hope in the near future. 
Conclusion: Much knowledge has been forthcoming in realizing the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever. But, additional studies need to be done.

TI  - The Phosphatidylserine and Phosphatidylethanolamine Receptor CD300a Binds Dengue Virus and Enhances Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 92
EP  - 102
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is the etiological agent of the major human arboviral disease. We previously demonstrated that the TIM and TAM families of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) receptors involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells mediate DENV entry into target cells. We show here that human CD300a, a recently identified phospholipid receptor, also binds directly DENV particles and enhances viral entry. CD300a facilitates infection of the four DENV serotypes, as well as of other mosquito-borne viruses such as West Nile virus and Chikungunya virus. CD300a acts as an attachment factor that enhances DENV internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. CD300a recognizes predominantly phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEth) and to a lesser extent PtdSer associated with viral particles. Mutation of residues in the IgV domain critical for phospholipid binding abrogate CD300a-mediated enhancement of DENV infection. Finally, we show that CD300a is expressed at the surface of primary macrophages and anti-CD300a polyclonal antibodies partially inhibited DENV infection of these cells. Overall, these data indicate that CD300a is a novel DENV binding receptor that recognizes PtdEth and PtdSer present on virions and enhance infection. IMPORTANCE Dengue disease, caused by dengue virus (DENV), has emerged as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans and is a major global health concern. The molecular bases of DENV-host cell interactions during virus entry are poorly understood, hampering the discovery of new targets for antiviral intervention. We recently discovered that the TIM and TAM proteins, two receptor families involved in the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer)-dependent phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells, interact with DENV particles-associated PtdSer through a mechanism that mimics the recognition of apoptotic cells and mediate DENV infection. In this study, we show that CD300a, a novel identified phospholipid receptor, mediates DENV infection. CD300a-dependent DENV infection relies on the direct recognition of phosphatidylethanolamine and to a lesser extent PtdSer associated with viral particles. This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms that mediate DENV entry and reinforce the concept that DENV uses an apoptotic mimicry strategy for viral entry.

TI  - The Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein Is a Transacting Factor for the Dengue Virus Internal Ribosome Entry Site
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae. Translation initiation of the DENV mRNA (vRNA) can occur following a cap-dependent, 5′-3’end-dependent internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-independent or IRES-dependent mechanism. This study evaluated the activity of DENV IRES in BHK-21 cells and the role of the polypyrimidine-tract binding protein (PTB) isoforms PTB1, PTB2, and PTB4 as IRES-transacting factors (ITAFs) for the DENV IRES. The results show that DENV-IRES activity is stimulated in DENV-replicating BHK-21 cells and cells expressing the Foot-and-mouth disease virus leader or Human rhinovirus 2A proteases. Protease activity was necessary, although a complete shutdown of cap-dependent translation initiation was not a requirement to stimulate DENV IRES activity. Regarding PTB, the results show that PTB1 > PTB2 > PTB4 stimulates DENV-IRES activity in BHK-21 cells. Mutations in the PTB RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), RRM1/RRM2 or RRM3/RRM4, differentially impact PTB1, PTB2, and PTB4’s ability to promote DENV IRES-mediated translation initiation in BHK-21 cells. PTB1-induced DENV-IRES stimulation is rescinded when RRM1/RRM2 or RRM3/RRM4 are disrupted. Mutations in RRM1/RRM2 or RRM3/RRM4 do not affect the ITAF activity of PTB2. Mutating RRM3/RRM4, but not RRM1/RRM2, abolishes the ability of PTB4 to stimulate the DENV IRES. Thus, PTB1, PTB2, and PTB4 are ITAFs for the DENV IRES.

TI  - The Polypyrimidine Tract-binding Protein Is Required for Efficient Dengue Virus Propagation and Associates with the Viral Replication Machinery*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 284
SP  - 17021
EP  - 17029
AB  - The polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) functions primarily as an IRES trans-acting factor in the propagation of hepatitis C virus and picornaviruses. PTB interacts with secondary structures within the 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions of these viral genomes to mediate efficient IRES-mediated viral translation. PTB has also been reported to bind to the untranslated region of the single-stranded RNA dengue virus (DENV), suggesting a similar function for PTB in flaviviruses. Indeed small interfering RNA-mediated PTB knockdown inhibited the production of infectious DENV, and this inhibition was specific to PTB knockdown and not due to a nonspecific anti-viral state. In fact, PTB depletion did not inhibit the production infectious yellow fever virus, another flavivirus. Nevertheless, whereas PTB knockdown led to a significant decrease in the accumulation of DENV viral RNAs, it did not impair translation. Moreover, PTB was shown to interact with the DENV nonstructural 4A protein, a known component of the viral replication complex, and with the DENV genome during infection. These data suggest that PTB interacts with the replication complex of DENV and is acting at the level of viral RNA replication.

TI  - The Promising Potential of Ezh1 Inhibition as a Therapeutic Strategy Against Dengue Infections
JF  - Journal of Immunology Research
AB  - The investigation of enhancer of zeste homolog 1 (Ezh1) in the context of dengue infection immunity has been limited, necessitating further exploration to elucidate its precise role and underlying mechanisms during infections. To address this gap, we generated Ezh1 knockout mice and obtained bone marrow and spleen samples from both Ezh1 knockout mice and wild‐type (WT) counterparts. Leveraging RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) analysis, we identified the enrichment of genes associated with the interleukin‐17 (IL‐17) signaling pathway among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the spleens of male Ezh1 knockout mice when compared to WT mice. Furthermore, our results revealed that Ezh1 knockout not only curtailed the viral load in dengue virus (DENV) infections but also suppressed the expression of pivotal cytokines, including interleukin‐9 (IL‐9) and IL‐17. Additionally, utilizing high‐parameter flow cytometry, we observed alterations in the immune cell phenotype within the spleens linked to Ezh1 gene knockout. Specifically, Ezh1 knockout inhibited the expressions of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1), lymphocyte‐activation gene 3 (LAG‐3), and cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86). Additionally, we noted a reduction in cluster of differentiation 62L (CD62L) expression in neutrophils following DENV infection. Our comprehensive findings collectively underscore the significant role of Ezh1 in DENV infection, suggesting that targeting Ezh1 could offer a promising antiviral strategy.

TI  - The Pseudo-Circular Genomes of Flaviviruses: Structures, Mechanisms, and Functions of Circularization
JF  - Cells
VL  - 10
AB  - The circularization of viral genomes fulfills various functions, from evading host defense mechanisms to promoting specific replication and translation patterns supporting viral proliferation. Here, we describe the genomic structures and associated host factors important for flaviviruses genome circularization and summarize their functional roles. Flaviviruses are relatively small, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with genomes of approximately 11 kb in length. These genomes contain motifs at their 5′ and 3′ ends, as well as in other regions, that are involved in circularization. These motifs are highly conserved throughout the Flavivirus genus and occur both in mature virions and within infected cells. We provide an overview of these sequence motifs and RNA structures involved in circularization, describe their linear and circularized structures, and discuss the proteins that interact with these circular structures and that promote and regulate their formation, aiming to clarify the key features of genome circularization and understand how these affect the flaviviruses life cycle.

TI  - The RNA binding protein Quaking represses splicing of the Fibronectin EDA exon and downregulates the interferon response
JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 49
SP  - 10034
EP  - 10045
AB  - Abstract Quaking (QKI) controls RNA metabolism in many biological processes including innate immunity, where its roles remain incompletely understood. To illuminate these roles, we performed genome scale transcriptome profiling in QKI knockout cells with or without poly(I:C) transfection, a double-stranded RNA analog that mimics viral infection. Analysis of RNA-sequencing data shows that QKI knockout upregulates genes induced by interferons, suggesting that QKI is an immune suppressor. Furthermore, differential splicing analysis shows that QKI primarily controls cassette exons, and among these events, we noted that QKI silences splicing of the extra domain A (EDA) exon in fibronectin (FN1) transcripts. QKI knockout results in elevated production and secretion of FN1-EDA protein, which is a known activator of interferons. Consistent with an upregulation of the interferon response in QKI knockout cells, our results show reduced production of dengue virus-2 and Japanese encephalitis virus in these cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that QKI downregulates the interferon system and attenuates the antiviral state.

TI  - The RNAi pathway plays a small part in Wolbachia-mediated blocking of dengue virus in mosquito cells
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Wolbachia pipientis is an insect endosymbiont known to limit the replication of viruses including dengue and Zika in their primary mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. Wolbachia is being released into mosquito populations globally in a bid to control the diseases caused by these viruses. It is theorized that Wolbachia’s priming of the insect immune system may confer protection against subsequent viral infection. Other hypotheses posit a role for competition between Wolbachia and viruses for host cellular resources. Using an A. aegypti cell line infected with Wolbachia, we tested the effects of targeting siRNAs against the major innate immune pathways on dengue virus loads. We show that while Wolbachia infection induces genes in the Toll, JAK/STAT and RNAi pathways, only reduced expression of RNAi leads to a rebound of dengue virus loads in Wolbachia-infected cells. The magnitude of the effect explained less than 10% of the total DENV load, demonstrating that blocking must be dependent on other factors in addition to the expression of RNAi. The findings bode well for the long-term stability of blocking given that immunity gene expression would likely be highly plastic and susceptible to rapid evolution.

TI  - The Ras/ERK signaling pathway couples antimicrobial peptides to mediate resistance to dengue virus in Aedes mosquitoes
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 14
AB  - Aedes mosquitoes can transmit dengue and several other severe vector-borne viral diseases, thereby influencing millions of people worldwide. Insects primarily control and clear the viral infections via their innate immune systems. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are both evolutionarily conserved components of the innate immune systems. In this study, we investigated the role of MAPKs in Aedes mosquitoes following DENV infection by using genetic and pharmacological approaches. We demonstrated that knockdown of ERK, but not of JNK or p38, significantly enhances the viral replication in Aedes mosquito cells. The Ras/ERK signaling is activated in both the cells and midguts of Aedes mosquitoes following DENV infection, and thus plays a role in restricting the viral infection, as both genetic and pharmacological activation of the Ras/ERK pathway significantly decreases the viral titers. In contrast, inhibition of the Ras/ERK pathway enhances DENV infection. In addition, we identified a signaling crosstalk between the Ras/ERK pathway and DENV-induced AMPs in which defensin C participates in restricting DENV infection in Aedes mosquitoes. Our results reveal that the Ras/ERK signaling pathway couples AMPs to mediate the resistance of Aedes mosquitoes to DENV infection, which provides a new insight into understanding the crosstalk between MAPKs and AMPs in the innate immunity of mosquito vectors during the viral infection.

TI  - The Role of Apolipoproteins in Dengue Infection: A Review
JF  - 
VL  - 20
AB  - The re-emergence of the dengue virus in recent decades has significantly increased with almost 40%-50% of the world’s population being at risk. Meanwhile, cholesterol and its components, apolipoproteins, were found to play a vital role in dengue infectivity and the development of severe dengue. This review attempts to address the functional importance of cholesterol and related apolipoproteins in dengue virus pathogenesis and to identify the potential utilisation of this relationship in future diagnosis and management of dengue. The literature search was conducted using a computer-based electronic search on dengue infection with cholesterol and human lipoproteins from September 2017 to June 2019 through three main search engines: MEDLINE (OVID), PubMed, and Science Direct using the keywords including Flaviviruses, characteristics of dengue virus, the pathogenesis of dengue, enhancement of dengue, metabolism of cholesterol, cholesterol pathway and human lipoproteins in association with dengue. Dengue virus manipulates lipid raft integrity and utilizes cholesterol components and apolipoproteins for virus internalisation through LDLr and SR-BI receptors. Infectivity of the dengue virus correlated with a decrease in the cholesterol content of the virions. High cholesterol levels in the endoplasmic reticulum promote replication complexes formation of dengue virus. Cholesterol is needed for NS1 secretion which is essential in viral replication, dengue pathogenesis, and host immune evasion. Levels of cholesterol and its related components contributed to the development of severe dengue. The interplay between cholesterol and cellular proteins lead to significant effect in all aspects of the dengue virus replication cycle from viral entry to release.

AB  - Summary In a prospective clinical study of 50 patients with Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS), we investigated the association of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1f3 (IL-1f3), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and IL-6 with activation markers of coagulation (F1+2 and TATc) and fibrinolysis (t-PA, PAPc, and D-dimer). We found that TNF-a, IL-1f3 and Il-1Ra, but not IL-6, concentrations were elevated in the circulation during the early stage of infection and at discharge from hospital. TNF-a was significantly associated with D-dimer, an activation marker of fibrinolysis (p < 0.003), but not with activation markers of coagulation. IL-1f3 was significantly associated with t-PA (p < 0.03). IL-1Ra was significantly associated with F1+2, TATc (p < 0.04 and p < 0.02, respectively), whereas IL-6 was significantly associated with both, activation markers of coagulation (F1+2; p < 0.03) and fibrinolysis (PAPc; p = 0.002). Our data are in line with studies in bacterial sepsis. In severe dengue virus infection the same cytokines are involved in the onset and regulation of hemostasis.

TI  - The Role of Growth Factors in the Pathogenesis of Dengue: A Scoping Review
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - Growth factors (GFs) have a role in tissue repair and in the modulation of the expression of inflammatory cells in damage caused by pathogens. This study aims to systematize the evidence on the role of GFs in the pathogenesis of dengue. This scoping review considered all published peer-reviewed studies in the MEDLINE and Embase databases. Ultimately, 58 studies that analyzed GFs in dengue patients, published between 1998 and 2021, were included. DENV-2 infection and secondary infection were more frequent in the patients studied. ELISA and multiplex immunoassay (Luminex) were the most used measurement techniques. Increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, transforming growth factor beta, and hepatocyte growth factor as well as reduced levels of platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor were observed in severe dengue in most studies. Vascular endothelial growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor were identified as biomarkers of severity. In addition, there is evidence that the dengue virus can use the growth factor pathway to facilitate its entry into the cell and promote its viral replication. The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is an alternative treatment for dengue that is being studied.

TI  - The Role of Host Cholesterol During Flavivirus Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 8
AB  - In recent years the emergence and resurgence of arboviruses have generated a global health alert. Among arboviruses, Dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), Yellow Fever (YFV), and West Nile (WNV) virus, belong to the genus Flavivirus, cause high viremia and occasionally fatal clinical disease in humans. Given the genetic austerity of the virus, they depend on cellular factors and organelles to complete its replication. One of the cellular components required for flavivirus infection is cholesterol. Cholesterol is an abundant lipid in biomembranes of eukaryotes cells and is necessary to maintain the cellular homeostasis. Recently, it has been reported, that cholesterol is fundamental during flavivirus infection in both mammal and insect vector models. During infection with DENV, ZIKV, YFV, and WNV the modulation of levels of host-cholesterol facilitates viral entry, replicative complexes formation, assembly, egress, and control of the interferon type I response. This modulation involves changes in cholesterol uptake with the concomitant regulation of cholesterol receptors as well as changes in cholesterol synthesis related to important modifications in cellular metabolism pathways. In view of the flavivirus dependence of cholesterol and the lack of an effective anti-flaviviral treatment, this cellular lipid has been proposed as a therapeutic target to treat infection using FDA-approved cholesterol-lowering drugs. This review aims to address the dependence of cholesterol by flaviviruses as well as the basis for anti flaviviral therapy using drugs which target is cholesterol synthesis or uptake.

TI  - The Role of Noncoding RNA in the Transmission and Pathogenicity of Flaviviruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute a class of RNA molecules that lack protein-coding capacity. ncRNAs frequently modulate gene expression through specific interactions with target proteins or messenger RNAs, thereby playing integral roles in a wide array of cellular processes. The Flavivirus genus comprises several significant members, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and yellow fever virus (YFV), which have caused global outbreaks, resulting in high morbidity and mortality in human populations. The life cycle of arthropod-borne flaviviruses encompasses their transmission between hematophagous insect vectors and mammalian hosts. During this process, a complex three-way interplay occurs among the pathogen, vector, and host, with ncRNAs exerting a critical regulatory influence. ncRNAs not only constitute a crucial regulatory mechanism that has emerged from the coevolution of viruses and their hosts but also hold potential as antiviral targets for controlling flavivirus epidemics. This review introduces the biogenesis of flavivirus-derived ncRNAs and summarizes the regulatory roles of ncRNAs in viral replication, vector-mediated viral transmission, antiviral innate immunity, and viral pathogenicity. A profound comprehension of the interplay between ncRNAs and flaviviruses will help formulate efficacious prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against flavivirus-related diseases.

TI  - The Role of the Host Ubiquitin System in Promoting Replication of Emergent Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Ubiquitination of proteins is a post-translational modification process with many different cellular functions, including protein stability, immune signaling, antiviral functions and virus replication. While ubiquitination of viral proteins can be used by the host as a defense mechanism by destroying the incoming pathogen, viruses have adapted to take advantage of this cellular process. The ubiquitin system can be hijacked by viruses to enhance various steps of the replication cycle and increase pathogenesis. Emerging viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), flaviviruses like Zika and dengue, as well as highly pathogenic viruses like Ebola and Nipah, have the ability to directly use the ubiquitination process to enhance their viral-replication cycle, and evade immune responses. Some of these mechanisms are conserved among different virus families, especially early during virus entry, providing an opportunity to develop broad-spectrum antivirals. Here, we discuss the mechanisms used by emergent viruses to exploit the host ubiquitin system, with the main focus on the role of ubiquitin in enhancing virus replication.

TI  - The Role of the Stem-Loop A RNA Promoter in Flavivirus Replication
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - An essential challenge in the lifecycle of RNA viruses is identifying and replicating the viral genome amongst all the RNAs present in the host cell cytoplasm. Yet, how the viral polymerase selectively recognizes and copies the viral RNA genome is poorly understood. In flaviviruses, the 5′-end of the viral RNA genome contains a 70 nucleotide-long stem-loop, called stem-loop A (SLA), which functions as a promoter for genome replication. During replication, flaviviral polymerase NS5 specifically recognizes SLA to both initiate viral RNA synthesis and to methylate the 5′ guanine cap of the nascent RNA. While the sequences of this region vary between different flaviviruses, the three-way junction arrangement of secondary structures is conserved in SLA, suggesting that viruses recognize a common structural feature to replicate the viral genome rather than a particular sequence. To better understand the molecular basis of genome recognition by flaviviruses, we recently determined the crystal structures of flavivirus SLAs from dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). In this review, I will provide an overview of (1) flaviviral genome replication; (2) structures of viral SLA promoters and NS5 polymerases; and (3) and describe our current model of how NS5 polymerases specifically recognize the SLA at the 5′ terminus of the viral genome to initiate RNA synthesis at the 3′ terminus.

TI  - The Roles of IRF-3 and IRF-7 in Innate Antiviral Immunity against Dengue Virus
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 191
SP  - 4194
EP  - 4201
AB  - We investigated the roles of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and IRF-7 in innate antiviral immunity against dengue virus (DENV). Double-deficient Irf-3−/−7−/− mice infected with the DENV2 strain S221 possessed 1,000–150,000 fold higher levels of viral RNA than wild-type and single-deficient mice 24 h postinfection (hpi); however, they remained resistant to lethal infection. IFN-α/β was induced similarly in wild-type and Irf-3−/− mice post–DENV infection, whereas in the Irf-7−/− and Irf-3−/−7−/− mice, significantly low levels of IFN-α/β expression was observed within 24 hpi. IFN-stimulated gene induction was also delayed in Irf-3−/−7−/− mice relative to wild-type and single-deficient mice. In particular, Cxcl10 and Ifnα2 were rapidly induced independently of both IRF-3 and IRF-7 in the Irf-3−/−7−/− mice with DENV infection. Higher levels of serum IFN-γ, IL-6, CXCL10, IL-8, IL-12 p70, and TNF were also observed in Irf-3−/−7−/− mice 24 hpi, at which time point viral titers peaked and started to be cleared. Ab-mediated blockade experiments revealed that IFN-γ, CXCL10, and CXCR3 function to restrict DENV replication in Irf-3−/−7−/− mice. Additionally, the IFN-stimulated genes Cxcl10, Ifit1, Ifit3, and Mx2 can be induced via an IRF-3– and IRF-7–independent pathway that does not involve IFN-γ signaling for protection against DENV. Collectively, these results demonstrate that IRF-3 and IRF-7 are redundant, albeit IRF-7 plays a more important role than IRF-3 in inducing the initial IFN-α/β response; only the combined actions of IRF-3 and IRF-7 are necessary for efficient control of early DENV infection; and the late, IRF-3– and IRF-7–independent pathway contributes to anti-DENV immunity.

AB  - ABSTRACT The flavivirus nonstructural protein NS1 is expressed as three discrete species in infected mammalian cells: an intracellular, membrane-associated form essential for viral replication, a cell surface-associated form that may be involved in signal transduction, and a secreted form (sNS1), the biological properties of which remain elusive. To determine the distribution of the dengue virus (DEN) sNS1 protein in vivo, we have analyzed by immunohistological means the tissue tropism of purified DEN sNS1 injected intravenously into adult mice. The sNS1 protein was found predominantly associated with the liver, where hepatocytes appeared to represent a major target cell. We further showed that sNS1 could be efficiently endocytosed by human Huh7 and HepG2 hepatocytes in vitro. After its internalization, the protein was detected intracellularly for at least 48 h without being substantially degraded. Colocalization studies of sNS1 with markers of the endolysosomal compartments revealed that the protein was specifically targeted to lysobisphosphatidic acid-rich structures reminiscent of late endosomes, as confirmed by electron microscopy. Intracellular accumulation of sNS1 in Huh7 cells enhanced the fluid phase uptake of rhodamine-labeled dextran. Furthermore, preincubation of Huh7 cells with sNS1 increased dengue virus production after infection with the homologous strain of DEN-1 virus. Our results demonstrate that the accumulation of DEN sNS1 in the late endosomal compartment of hepatocytes potentializes subsequent dengue virus infection in vitro, raising the possibility that sNS1 may contribute to viral propagation in vivo.

TI  - The Serine Protease and RNA-Stimulated Nucleoside Triphosphatase and RNA Helicase Functional Domains of Dengue Virus Type 2 NS3 Converge within a Region of 20 Amino Acids
JF  - Journal of Virology

AB  - ABSTRACT NS3 protein of dengue virus type 2 has a serine protease domain within the N-terminal 180 residues. NS2B is required for NS3 to form an active protease involved in processing of the viral polyprotein precursor. The region carboxy terminal to the protease domain has conserved motifs present in several viral RNA-stimulated nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase)/RNA helicases. To define the functional domains of protease and NTPase/RNA helicase activities of NS3, full-length and amino-terminal deletion mutants of NS3 were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified. Deletion of 160 N-terminal residues of NS3 (as in NS3del.2) had no detrimental effect on the basal and RNA-stimulated NTPase as well as RNA helicase activities. However, mutagenesis of the conserved P-loop motif of the RNA helicase domain (K199E) resulted in loss of ATPase activity. The RNA-stimulated NTPase activity was significantly affected by deletion of 20 amino acid residues from the N terminus or by substitutions of the cluster of basic residues, 184RKRK→QNGN, of NS3del.2, although both mutant proteins retained the conserved RNA helicase motifs. Furthermore, the minimal NS3 protease domain, required for cleavage of the 2B-3 site, was precisely defined to be 167 residues, using the in vitro processing of NS2B-NS3 precursors. Our results reveal that the functional domains required for serine protease and RNA-stimulated NTPase activities map within the region between amino acid residues 160 and 180 of NS3 protein and that a novel motif, the cluster of basic residues 184RKRK, plays an important role for the RNA-stimulated NTPase activity.

TI  - The Small Molecules AZD0530 and Dasatinib Inhibit Dengue Virus RNA Replication via Fyn Kinase
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 7367
EP  - 7381
AB  - ABSTRACT In this study, we characterized the antiviral mechanism of action of AZD0530 and dasatinib, two pharmacological inhibitors of host kinases, that also inhibit dengue virus (DV) infection. Using Northern blot and reporter replicon assays, we demonstrated that both small molecules inhibit the DV2 infectious cycle at the step of steady-state RNA replication. In order to identify the cellular target of AZD0530 and dasatinib mediating this anti-DV2 activity, we examined the effects of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated depletion of the major kinases known to be inhibited by these small molecules. We determined that Fyn kinase, a target of both AZD0530 and dasatinib, is involved in DV2 RNA replication and is probably a major mediator of the anti-DV activity of these compounds. Furthermore, serial passaging of DV2 in the presence of dasatinib led to the identification of a mutation in the transmembrane domain 3 of the NS4B protein that overcomes the inhibition of RNA replication by AZD0530, dasatinib, and Fyn RNAi. Although we observed that dasatinib also inhibits DV2 particle assembly and/or secretion, this activity does not appear to be mediated by Src-family kinases. Together, our results suggest that AZD0530 and dasatinib inhibit DV at the step of viral RNA replication and demonstrate a critical role for Fyn kinase in this viral process. The antiviral activity of these compounds in vitro makes them useful pharmacological tools to validate Fyn or other host kinases as anti-DV targets in vivo.

TI  - The Stem Region of Premembrane Protein Plays an Important Role in the Virus Surface Protein Rearrangement during Dengue Maturation*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 287

EP  - 40534
AB  - Background: Dengue virus surface proteins, envelope (E) and pre-membrane (prM), undergo rearrangement during the maturation process at acidic condition. Results: prM-stem region binds tighter to both E protein and lipid membrane when environment becomes acidic. Conclusion: At acidic condition, E proteins are attracted to the membrane-associated prM-stem. Significance: prM-stem region induces virus structural changes during maturation. Newly assembled dengue viruses (DENV) undergo maturation to become infectious particles. The maturation process involves major rearrangement of virus surface premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins. The prM-E complexes on immature viruses are first assembled as trimeric spikes in the neutral pH environment of the endoplasmic reticulum. When the virus is transported to the low pH environment of the exosomes, these spikes rearrange into dimeric structures, which lie parallel to the virus lipid envelope. The proteins involved in driving this process are unknown. Previous cryoelectron microscopy studies of the mature DENV showed that the prM-stem region (residues 111–131) is membrane-associated and may interact with the E proteins. Here we investigated the prM-stem region in modulating the virus maturation process. The binding of the prM-stem region to the E protein was shown to increase significantly at low pH compared with neutral pH in ELISAs and surface plasmon resonance studies. In addition, the affinity of the prM-stem region for the liposome, as measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, was also increased when pH is lowered. These results suggest that the prM-stem region forms a tight association with the virus membrane and attracts the associated E protein in the low pH environment of exosomes. This will lead to the surface protein rearrangement observed during maturation.

TI  - The Structural Basis of Pathogenic Subgenomic Flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) Production
JF  - Science
VL  - 344
SP  - 307
EP  - 310
AB  - Resisting the Chop Dengue, West Nile, and Yellow Fever viruses are all flaviviruses that have single-stranded RNA genomes and form specific, short flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) during infection that cause viral pathogenicity. These sfRNAs are produced by the incomplete degradation of viral RNA by the host-cell exonuclease Xrn1. What stops the host enzyme from completely chopping up the viral RNA? Chapman et al. (p. 307) reveal a pseudoknot in the structure of the Xrn1-resistant segment of a sfRNA from Murray Valley Encephalitis Virus, which, perhaps, the host Xrn1 exonuclease cannot untangle. A pseudoknot in a flavivirus RNA resists efforts by a host nuclease to untangle it. Flaviviruses are emerging human pathogens and worldwide health threats. During infection, pathogenic subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) are produced by resisting degradation by the 5′→3′ host cell exonuclease Xrn1 through an unknown RNA structure-based mechanism. Here, we present the crystal structure of a complete Xrn1-resistant flaviviral RNA, which contains interwoven pseudoknots within a compact structure that depends on highly conserved nucleotides. The RNA’s three-dimensional topology creates a ringlike conformation, with the 5′ end of the resistant structure passing through the ring from one side of the fold to the other. Disruption of this structure prevents formation of sfRNA during flaviviral infection. Thus, sfRNA formation results from an RNA fold that interacts directly with Xrn1, presenting the enzyme with a structure that confounds its helicase activity.

AB  - ABSTRACT Wolbachia blocks dengue virus replication in Drosophila melanogaster as well as in Aedes aegypti. Using the Drosophila model and mutations in the Toll and Imd pathways, we showed that neither pathway is required for expression of the dengue virus-blocking phenotype in the Drosophila host. This provides additional evidence that the mechanistic basis of Wolbachia-mediated dengue virus blocking in insects is more complex than simple priming of the host insect innate immune system.

TI  - The Topology of Bulges in the Long Stem of the Flavivirus 3′ Stem-Loop Is a Major Determinant of RNA Replication Competence
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 2309
EP  - 2324
AB  - ABSTRACT All flavivirus genomes contain a 3′terminal stem-loop secondary structure (3′SL) formed by the most downstream ∼100 nucleotides (nt) of the viral RNA. The 3′SL is required for virus replication and has been shown to bind both virus-coded and cellular proteins. Results of the present study using an infectious DNA for WN virus strain 956 initially demonstrated that the dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN2) 3′SL nucleotide sequence could not substitute for that of the WN 3′SL to support WN genome replication. To determine what WN virus-specific 3′SL nucleotide sequences were required for WN virus replication, WN virus 3′SL nucleotide sequences were selectively deleted and replaced by analogous segments of the DEN2 3′SL nucleotide sequence such that the overall 3′SL secondary structure was not disrupted. Top and bottom portions of the WN virus 3′SL were defined according to previous studies (J. L. Blackwell and M. A. Brinton, J. Virol. 71:6433-6444, 1997; L. Zeng, L., B. Falgout, and L. Markoff, J. Virol. 72:7510-7522, 1998). A bulge in the top portion of the long stem of the WN 3′SL was essential for replication of mutant WN RNAs, and replication-defective RNAs failed to produce negative strands in transfected cells. Introduction of a second bulge into the bottom portion of the long stem of the wild-type WN 3′SL markedly enhanced the replication competence of WN virus in mosquito cells but had no effect on replication in mammalian cells. This second bulge was identified as a host cell-specific enhancer of flavivirus replication. Results suggested that bulges and their topological location within the long stem of the 3′SL are primary determinants of replication competence for flavivirus genomes.

TI  - The Transcriptional Response of Aedes aegypti with Variable Extrinsic Incubation Periods for Dengue Virus
JF  - Genome Biology and Evolution
VL  - 10
SP  - 3141
EP  - 3151
AB  - Abstract Dengue fever is the most prevalent arboviral disease globally. Dengue virus is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. One measure of the mosquito’s efficiency as a vector is the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), which is the time between the ingestion of viremic blood and the emergence of virions in the saliva. The longer it takes virus to infect the midgut and traverse to the saliva, the fewer opportunities the mosquito will have to transmit the pathogen over its lifetime. We have shown previously that EIP for dengue virus is highly heritable and that it is negatively correlated with vector lifespan. Here, we examined the transcriptional profiles for mosquitoes that varied in their EIP phenotype and identified pathways associated with either short or long EIP. We found that mosquitoes with short EIP have less active immune responses but higher levels of protein translation and calcium ion homeostasis and that mosquitoes with longer EIP may have slower metabolism. These findings indicate a complex interplay between calcium ion distribution, ribosome biogenesis, and metabolism and reveal potential pathways that could be modified to slow the rate of viral progression and hence limit lifetime transmission capability.

TI  - The Unique Transmembrane Hairpin of Flavivirus Fusion Protein E Is Essential for Membrane Fusion
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 4377
EP  - 4385
AB  - ABSTRACT The fusion of enveloped viruses with cellular membranes is mediated by proteins that are anchored in the lipid bilayer of the virus and capable of triggered conformational changes necessary for driving fusion. The flavivirus envelope protein E is the only known viral fusion protein with a double membrane anchor, consisting of two antiparallel transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2). TM1 functions as a stop-transfer sequence and TM2 as an internal signal sequence for the first nonstructural protein during polyprotein processing. The possible role of this peculiar C-terminal helical hairpin in membrane fusion has not been investigated so far. We addressed this question by studying TM mutants of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) recombinant subviral particles (RSPs), an established model system for flavivirus membrane fusion. The engineered mutations included the deletion of TM2, the replacement of both TM domains (TMDs) by those of the related Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and the use of chimeric TBEV-JEV membrane anchors. Using these mutant RSPs, we provide evidence that TM2 is not just a remnant of polyprotein processing but, together with TM1, plays an active role in fusion. None of the TM mutations, including the deletion of TM2, affected early steps of the fusion process, but TM interactions apparently contribute to the stability of the postfusion E trimer and the completion of the merger of the membranes. Our data provide evidence for both intratrimer and intertrimer interactions mediated by the TMDs of E and thus extend the existing models of flavivirus membrane fusion.

TI  - The anti-immune dengue subgenomic flaviviral RNA is present in vesicles in mosquito saliva and is associated with increased infectivity
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 19
AB  - Mosquito transmission of dengue viruses to humans starts with infection of skin resident cells at the biting site. There is great interest in identifying transmission-enhancing factors in mosquito saliva in order to counteract them. Here we report the discovery of high levels of the anti-immune subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) in dengue virus 2-infected mosquito saliva. We established that sfRNA is present in saliva using three different methods: northern blot, RT-qPCR and RNA sequencing. We next show that salivary sfRNA is protected in detergent-sensitive compartments, likely extracellular vesicles. In support of this hypothesis, we visualized viral RNAs in vesicles in mosquito saliva and noted a marked enrichment of signal from 3’UTR sequences, which is consistent with the presence of sfRNA. Furthermore, we show that incubation with mosquito saliva containing higher sfRNA levels results in higher virus infectivity in a human hepatoma cell line and human primary dermal fibroblasts. Transfection of 3’UTR RNA prior to DENV2 infection inhibited type I and III interferon induction and signaling, and enhanced viral replication. Therefore, we posit that sfRNA present in salivary extracellular vesicles is delivered to cells at the biting site to inhibit innate immunity and enhance dengue virus transmission.

TI  - The antiparasitic drug niclosamide inhibits dengue virus infection by interfering with endosomal acidification independent of mTOR
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 12
AB  - Background The antiparasitic agent niclosamide has been demonstrated to inhibit the arthropod-borne Zika virus. Here, we investigated the antiviral capacity of niclosamide against dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 infection in vitro and in vivo. Principle finding Niclosamide effectively retarded DENV-induced infection in vitro in human adenocarcinoma cells (A549), mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a), and baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21). Treatment with niclosamide did not retard the endocytosis of DENV while niclosamide was unable to enhance the antiviral type I interferon response. Furthermore, niclosamide did not cause a direct effect on viral replicon-based expression. Niclosamide has been reported to competitively inhibit the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling pathways; however, selective inhibitors of those pathways did not reduce DENV infection. Similar to the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, both niclosamide and other protonophores, such as CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone), and FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), effectively reduced endosomal acidification and viral dsRNA replication. Co-administration of a single dose of niclosamide partially decreased viral replication, viral encephalitis, and mortality in DENV-infected ICR suckling mice. Significance These results demonstrate that niclosamide diminishes viral infection by hindering endosomal acidification.

TI  - The biological role of Asn-linked glycosylations of DENV-2 E protein
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - The envelope proteins of many viruses are glycosylated, where the glycans on the virion
surface have been shown to be important, in addition to their strictly structural role, in various aspects of the virus life cycle, such as receptor-binding and escape from antibody recognition. Dengue virus (DENV) is in terms of human disease frequency the most
important member of the flaviviruses, a group of small, enveloped, plus-strand RNA
viruses. The four DENV serotypes differ from all other flaviviruses by the presence of
two glycans on the envelope (E) protein, one linked to Asn-153, a glycosylation which is
well conserved among the flaviviruses, and a second linked to Asn-67, which is unique to
DENY. While the presence of glycan at Asn-153 has been shown by others to influence
fusion of viral with cellular membranes, infectivity, assembly and/or release and
virulence, the glycan at Asn-67 has been suggested to be critical in virus attachment to the cell surface molecule, DC-SIGN, a putative cellular receptor for DENV. In this study, I have used a reverse genetics approach to prevent glycosylation at Asn-67, Asn-153, or both carbohydrate acceptor sites, in order to investigate their physiological function(s). Single or multiple point mutation were introduced at the Asn-153 and Asn-67 glycosylation sites, respectively, on the E protein ofDENV-2 strains NGC and PUO-218, using two infectious cDNA clones. DENV -2 strain, NGC, is a laboratory-adapted virus, while strain PUO-218 is a low-passage natural isolate from Toxorhynchites splendens mosquitoes. ... I also show that removal of both glycans from the DENV-2 E protein prevents the recovery of viable virus with a stable mutant genotype (Chapters 3 and 5). Nevertheless, given the importance of strain origin and type of substitution used for deletion of the carbohydrate acceptor sites that I have demonstrated in this thesis, it is likely that the engineering of a viable DENV variant lacking both E protein glycans is feasible.

TI  - The circadian clock components BMAL1 and REV-ERBα regulate flavivirus replication
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 10
AB  - The circadian clock regulates immune responses to microbes and affects pathogen replication, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that the circadian components BMAL1 and REV-ERBα influence several steps in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle, including particle entry into hepatocytes and RNA genome replication. Genetic knock out of Bmal1 and over-expression or activation of REV-ERB with synthetic agonists inhibits the replication of HCV and the related flaviruses dengue and Zika via perturbation of lipid signaling pathways. This study highlights a role for the circadian clock component REV-ERBα in regulating flavivirus replication. The circadian clock can affect pathogen replication, but underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here the authors demonstrate that the circadian components BMAL1 and REV-ERBα affect entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV) into hepatocytes and genome replication of HCV and related flaviviruses dengue and zika.

TI  - The dengue virus NS1 protein conveys pro-inflammatory signals by docking onto human high-density lipoproteins
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The nonstructural NS1 protein is a virulence factor secreted by dengue virus (DENV)-infected cells. NS1 is known to alter the complement system, activate immune cells and perturb endothelial barriers. Here we show that pro-inflammatory signals are triggered by a high affinity complex formed between NS1 and human high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Electron microscopy images of the NS1-HDL complexes show spherical HDL particles with rod-shaped NS1 protrusions on their surface. These complexes are readily detectable in the plasma of hospitalized dengue patients using anti-apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) antibodies specific of the HDL moiety. The functional reprogramming of HDL particles by the NS1 protein as a means to exacerbate systemic inflammation during DENV infection provides a new paradigm linking the human lipoprotein network to dengue pathogenesis.

VL  - 104

AB  - Summary Dengue virus (DV) infections cause mild dengue fever or severe life-threatening dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)/ dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DV-infected patients have high plasma concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1). However, the mechanism to cause haemorrhage in DV infections remains poorly understood. In this study, investigation was carried out on the purified recombinant domain III of the envelope glycoprotein of DV serotypes 2 (EIII) and the signalling pathways of EIII leading to PAI-1 gene expression were measured by RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence stain. Reporter gene constructs containing serially 5’-deleted sequences of the proximal human PAI-1 promoter region were constructed and then transfected to Huh7 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, prior to EIII treatment. EIII increased the PAI-1 mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner in Huh7 cells. Results showed that U0126, an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK), almost completely suppressed EIII-induced PAI-1 expression. The results suggest that the MEK/ERK signalling pathways mediate the EIII-dependent induction of PAI-1 gene expression via the proximal promoter region.

TI  - The dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) interacts with the putative epigenetic regulator DIDO1 to promote flavivirus replication
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) NS1 is a multifunctional protein essential for viral replication. To gain insights into NS1 functions in mosquito cells, the protein interactome of DENV NS1 in C6/36 cells was investigated using a proximity biotinylation system and mass spectrometry. Approximately 14% of the 817 identified proteins coincide with interactomes obtained in vertebrate cells, including ontology groups of the oligosaccharide transferase complex, the chaperonin containing TCP-1, and nuclear import and export, vesicle localization and ribosomal proteins. Notably, other protein pathways such as epigenetic regulation and RNA silencing, not previously reported in vertebrate cells, were also found in the NS1 interactome in mosquito cells. Due to the novel interaction observed for NS1 and DIDO1 (Death Inducer-Obliterator 1), we further explored the role of DIDO1 in viral replication. Interactions between NS1 and DIDO1were corroborated in infected C6/36 and Aag2 cells, by colocalization and proximity ligation assays. Silencing DIDO1 expression in C6/36 and Aag2 cells results in a significant reduction in DENV and ZIKV replication and progeny production. Comparison of transcription analysis of mock or DENV infected C6/36 silenced for DIDO1, revealed variations in multiple gene expression pathways, including pathways associated with DENV infection such as RNA surveillance, IMD and Toll. These results suggest that DIDO1 is a host factor involved in the negative modulation of the antiviral response and necessary for flavivirus replication. Our findings uncover novel mechanisms of NS1 to promote DENV and ZIKV replication and add to the understanding of NS1 as a multifunctional protein. ABSTRACT IMPORTANCE Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease to humans. Dengue virus NS1 is a multifunctional protein essential for replication and modulation of innate immunity. To gain insights into NS1 functions, the protein interactome of dengue virus NS1 in Aedes albopictus cells was investigated using a proximity biotinylation system and mass spectrometry. Several protein pathways, not previously observed in vertebrate cells, such as epigenetic regulation and RNA silencing, were found as part of the NS1 interactome in mosquito cells. Among those, DIDO1 was found to be a necessary host factor for dengue and Zika virus replication in vertebrate and mosquito cells. Transcription analysis of infected mosquito cells silenced for DIDO1, revealed alterations of the IMD and Toll pathways, part of the antiviral response in mosquitoes. The results suggest that DIDO1 is a host factor involved in modulation of the antiviral response and necessary for flavivirus replication.

TI  - The dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected mosquito cells via a non-classical caveolin-1-dependent pathway.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 98 8
SP  - 2088
EP  - 2099
AB  - Dengue virus NS1 is a glycoprotein of 46-50 kDa that is conserved among flaviviruses, associates as a dimer to cell membranes and is secreted as a hexamer to the extracellular milieu. Recent evidence showed that NS1 is secreted efficiently from infected mosquito cells. To explore the secretory route of NS1 in mosquito cells, infected cells were treated with brefeldin A (BFA) and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MβCD). The results showed that MβCD, but not BFA, significantly reduced the release of NS1. Moreover, silencing the expression of caveolin-1 (CAV1; a key component of the caveolar system that transports cholesterol inside the cell), but not SAR1 (a GTPase that participates in the classical secretory pathway), also results in a significant reduction of the secretion of NS1. These results indicate that NS1 is released from mosquito cells via an unconventional secretory route that bypasses the Golgi complex, with the participation of CAV1. In agreement with this notion, differences were observed in the glycosylation status between secreted NS1 and E proteins. Classical mechanics and docking simulations suggested highly favoured interactions between the caveolin-binding domain present in NS1 and the scaffolding domain of CAV1. Finally, proximity ligation assays showed direct interaction between NS1 and CAV1 in infected mosquito cells. These findings are in line with the lipoprotein nature of secreted NS1 and provide new insights into the biology of NS1.

TI  - The dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from mosquito cells in association with the intracellular cholesterol transporter chaperone caveolin complex
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the family Flaviviridae. The RNA viral genome encodes for a polyprotein that is co-translationally processed into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional viral protein actively secreted in vertebrate and mosquito cells during DENV infection. In mosquito cells, NS1 is secreted in a caveolin-1 (CAV-1) dependent manner by an unconventional pathway. The caveolin chaperone complex (CCC) is a cytoplasmic complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA which is responsible for cholesterol traffic inside the cell. In this work, we demonstrate that in infected mosquito cells, DENV NS1 is secreted by an early and unconventional route that bypasses the Golgi apparatus in close association with the CCC. Treatment of mosquito cells with classic secretion inhibitors such as brefeldin A, golgicide A and Fli-06 showed no effect on NS1 secretion, but significant reductions in recombinant luciferase secretion and virion release. Silencing the expression of CAV1, FKBP52 with siRNAs or the inhibition of CyA by cyclosporine A resulted in significant decrease in NS1 secretion without affecting virion release. Using co-localization, co-inmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, NS1 was found to co-localize and interact with all the protein components of the CCC in mosquito infected cells. In addition, CAV-1 and FKBP52 expression was found augmented in DENV infected cells. Finally, the treatment of ZIKV infected mosquito cells with brefeldin A and golgicide A showed no effect on NS1 secretion, while affecting virion release. ZIKV NS1 was also found to co-localize with CAV-1 in infected mosquito cells. These results suggest that in mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1 follows the same secretory pathway observed for DENV NS1. The association of NS1 with the cholesterol transporter CCC agrees with the lipoprotein nature of secreted hexameric NS1. AUTHOR SUMMARY Dengue protein NS1 is secreted in infected mosquito and vertebrate cells. In humans, secreted NS1 have been associated with pathogenesis. In mosquito cells, NS1 follows an unconventional secretion pathway that is dependent on Caveolin-1. This work shows that in mosquito cells, NS1 secretion is associated to the chaperone caveolin complex, a complex formed by caveolin-1 and several chaperones, in charge of cholesterol transport within the cells. Reduction of the expression or the activity of chaperone caveolin complex in mosquito infected cells, diminished the secretion of NS1 without affecting virion release. Direct interaction between NS1 and the chaperone caveolin complex proteins was demonstrated by several assays. Moreover, increased expression of the caveolin-1 and co-chaperone FKBP52 during dengue infection was found, presumably in response to the higher requirements of these proteins during dengue virus infection. Results obtained with ZIKV infected mosquito cells suggest that also ZIKV NS1 is released following an unconventional secretory route in association with the chaperone caveolin complex. The functions of secreted NS1 within mosquito are unclear. However, giving the importance of the soluble NS1 in the vertebrate host, manipulation of the NS1 secretory route may prove a valuable strategy for dengue mosquito control and patient treatment.

TI  - The dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) use the scavenger receptor B1 as cell receptor in human hepatic and mosquito cells
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dengue is the most common virus disease transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The dengue virus NS1 is a multifunctional protein that form part of replication complexes. In addition, NS1 is also secreted, as a hexamer, to the extracellular milieu. Circulating NS1 has been associated with dengue pathogenesis by several different mechanisms. Cell binding and internalization of soluble NS1 result in the disruption of tight junctions and in down regulation of the innate immune response. In this work, we report that the HDL scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1) in human hepatic cells, and a scavenger receptor B1-like in mosquito C6/36 cells act as cell surface binding receptor for dengue virus NS1. The presence of the SRB1 on the plasma membrane of C6/36 cells, as well as in Huh-7 cells, was demonstrated by confocal microcopy. Internalization of NS1 can be efficiently blocked by anti-SRB1 antibodies and previous incubation of the cells with HDL significantly reduces NS1 internalization. In addition, the transient expression of SRB1 in Vero cells, which lack the receptor, renders these cells susceptible to NS1 entry. Direct interaction between soluble NS1 and the SRB1 in Huh7 and C6/36 cells was demonstrated in vivo by proximity ligation assays an in vitro by surface plasmon resonance. Finally, data is presented indicating that the SRB1 also act as cell receptor for zika virus NS1. These results demonstrate that dengue virus NS1, a bona fide lipoprotein, usurps the HDL receptor for cell entry and offers explanations for the altered serum lipoprotein homeostasis observed in dengue patients.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 75 ( Pt 9)
SP  - 2387
EP  - 92
AB  - This study describes the susceptibility to dengue virus infection of a monocytic cell line at different states of differentiation. Infectious virus titres increased in undifferentiated U937 cells following infection with clinical isolates but only when the cells were infected via their Fc receptors. No. c.p.e. was observed and virus was not secreted into supernatant fluid. Once differentiated, cells were susceptible to infection either with virus alone or with virus-antibody complexes. Infection was cytolytic and virus was released into the supernatant fluid. Similar results were obtained with freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes. Increased blood vessel permeability, which occurs in dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome patients, has been correlated with secondary heterotypic infections and has been postulated to arise from antibody-enhanced infection of monocytes. The data presented suggest a possible mechanism whereby infected monocytes undergoing diapedesis through blood vessel walls might differentiate sufficiently during the process to release virus and cytokines at localized sites on blood vessels.

JF  - The Biochemical journal
VL  - 444 3
SP  - 405
EP  - 15
AB  - Dengue is the major arthropod-borne human viral disease, for which no vaccine or specific treatment is available. We used NMR, zeta potential measurements and atomic force microscopy to study the structural features of the interaction between dengue virus C (capsid) protein and LDs (lipid droplets), organelles crucial for infectious particle formation. C protein-binding sites to LD were mapped, revealing a new function for a conserved segment in the N-terminal disordered region and indicating that conformational selection is involved in recognition. The results suggest that the positively charged N-terminal region of C protein prompts the interaction with negatively charged LDs, after which a conformational rearrangement enables the access of the central hydrophobic patch to the LD surface. Taken together, the results allowed the design of a peptide with inhibitory activity of C protein-LD binding, paving the way for new drug development approaches against dengue.

JF  - Virology

EP  - 53
AB  - Infection of dengue viruses (DENs) can cause human dengue fever, hemorrhagic fever, or shock syndrome. Although DEN-induced apoptosis has been implicated in pathogenesis of the DEN-related diseases, the underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the effect of ectopic expression of human bcl-2 and bcl-X genes on DEN-induced apoptosis in cultured cells. We employed a human isolate of DEN serotype 2 (DEN-2), PL046, which not only caused cell-cycle arrest in the G1 phase but also induced apoptosis in infected baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells, murine neuroblastoma N18 cells, and human neuronal NT-2 cells. Our results reveal that overexpression of bcl-2 in fibroblast-like BHK-21 cells, although not inhibiting virus yields, delayed the process of DEN-induced apoptosis, thereby permitting surviving cells to become persistently infected. In contrast, stable bcl-2 expression in neuronal N18 cells failed to block DEN-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, Bcl-X(L), expressed predominantly in the nervous system, appeared to delay DEN's killing effect in neuronal N18 cells but not in fibroblast-like BHK-21 cells. In addition, inducible expression bcl-X(s), despite its proapoptotic property in other reported system, was found to merely accelerate cell death in DEN-infected N18 but not in infected BHK-21 cells. Thus, through studying the effect of human bcl-2-related genes, our results suggest that DEN infection may trigger target cells to undergo morphologically similar but biochemically distinct apoptotic pathways in a cell-specific manner.

TI  - The effects of DENV serotype competition and co-infection on viral kinetics in Wolbachia-infected and uninfected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 14
AB  - The Aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for the transmission of several medically important arthropod-borne viruses, including multiple serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4). Competition within the mosquito between DENV serotypes can affect viral infection dynamics, modulating the transmission potential of the pathogen. Vector control remains the main method for limiting dengue fever. The insect endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis is currently being trialed in field releases globally as a means of biological control because it reduces virus replication inside the mosquito. It is not clear how co-infection between DENV serotypes in the same mosquito might alter the pathogen-blocking phenotype elicited by Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti. Five- to 7-day-old female Ae. aegypti from two lines, namely, with (wMel) and without Wolbachia infection (WT), were fed virus-laden blood through an artificial membrane with either a mix of DENV-2 and DENV-3 or the same DENV serotypes singly. Mosquitoes were subsequently incubated inside environmental chambers and collected on the following days post-infection: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13. Midgut, carcass, and salivary glands were collected from each mosquito at each timepoint and individually analyzed to determine the percentage of DENV infection and viral RNA load via RT-qPCR. We saw that for WT mosquitoes DENV-3 grew to higher viral RNA loads across multiple tissues when co-infected with DENV-2 than when it was in a mono-infection. Additionally, we saw a strong pathogen-blocking phenotype in wMel mosquitoes independent of co-infection status. In this study, we demonstrated that the wMel mosquito line is capable of blocking DENV serotype co-infection in a systemic way across the mosquito body. Moreover, we showed that for WT mosquitoes, serotype co-infection can affect infection frequency in a tissue- and time-specific manner and that both viruses have the potential of being transmitted simultaneously. Our findings suggest that the long-term efficacy of Wolbachia pathogen blocking is not compromised by arthropod-borne virus co-infection.

AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide and are transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Mosquitoes become infected after ingesting a viremic bloodmeal, and molecular mechanisms involved in bloodmeal digestion may affect the ability of DENV to infect the midgut. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence expression of four midgut serine proteases and assessed the effect of each RNAi phenotype on DENV-2 infectivity of Aedes aegypti. Silencing resulted in significant reductions in protease mRNA levels and correlated with a reduction in activity except in the case of late trypsin. RNA silencing of chymotrypsin, early and late trypsin had no effect on DENV-2 infectivity. However, silencing of 5G1 or the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor to the infectious bloodmeals significantly increased midgut infection rates. These results suggest that some midgut serine proteases may actually limit DENV-2 infectivity of Ae. aegypti.

JF  - Virology
VL  - 194 2
SP  - 769
EP  - 80
AB  - cDNA of dengue virus type 2 encoding the glycoprotein NS1 was transiently expressed in COS cells using an SV40-based vector. To test the importance of selected regions of the protein in dimer formation, constructs were prepared which encoded amino acid changes at specific locations. Six of the 12 Cys residues in the NS1 protein were individually changed to Ala. Two amino acids in each of three hydrophilic and two hydrophobic areas of the protein were also changed to Ala. The ability of these 11 mutant proteins to form dimers, the sensitivity of the dimers to dissociation by heat, and the secretion of the mutant proteins from transfected cells were investigated by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and indirect immunofluorescence. The results demonstrated that the carboxy terminal end of the protein is important in dimer formation. In particular, the substitution of Ala for any one of the last three Cys residues, which are located within the carboxy terminal forty amino acids of the protein, prevented dimer formation. Only the proteins which formed dimers were detected at the cell surface and in the extracellular medium. No monomers were secreted.

TI  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER): a crucial cellular hub in flavivirus infection and potential target site for antiviral interventions
JF  - npj Viruses
VL  - 2
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent arthropod-borne flavivirus and imposes a significant healthcare threat worldwide. At present no FDA-approved specific antiviral treatment is available, and the safety of a vaccine against DENV is still on debate. Following its entry into the host cell, DENV takes advantage of the cellular secretory pathway to produce new infectious particles. The key organelle of the host cell in DENV infections is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which supports various stages throughout the entire life cycle of flaviviruses. This review delves into the intricate interplay between flaviviruses and the ER during their life cycle with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying viral replication, protein processing and virion assembly. Emphasizing the significance of the ER in the flavivirus life cycle, we highlight potential antiviral targets in ER-related steps during DENV replication and summarize the current antiviral drugs that are in (pre)clinical developmental stage. Insights into the exploitation of the ER by DENV offer promising avenues for the development of targeted antiviral strategies, providing a foundation for future research and therapeutic interventions against flaviviruses.

TI  - The entanglement between flaviviruses and ER-shaping proteins
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a continuous intracellular membrane system that composes the nuclear envelope and radiates out to the peripheries of the cell, transitioning from ribosome-studded, flat cisternal sheets to highly curved reticulated tubules. It has been implicated in a diverse array of cellular functions, including production, trafficking, and degradation of proteins; synthesis and distribution of lipids and steroids; calcium sequestration and release; cell signaling and innate immunity; carbohydrate metabolism; and detoxification of harmful substances [1]. Such a ubiquitous and functionally versatile organelle is parasitized by viruses in order to facilitate their life cycle. Rotavirus, vaccinia virus (VV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as members of the Flavivirus genus—dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV)—are all intimately associated with the ER [2]. The flaviviruses replicate on the ER membranes and form immature viral particles that bud into the ER lumen. These particles are then trafficked through the ER–Golgi network and undergo a maturation process brought about by pH alteration and cleavage by the hostprotease Furin. This viral takeover of the ER requires the co-opting of cellular proteins as well as the active remodeling of the ER membrane to create a cellular environment more conducive to replication [3]. Several ER proteins have been identified as host factors in flavivirus replication [4], but a class of resident proteins that shape and maintain the dynamic ER architecture are of particular interest. These “ER-shaping” proteins could potentially serve as host factors that support viral replication or restriction factors that protect the ER. Interactome and CRISPR screens have produced somewhat discordant results, but the less stringent screens suggest that ER-shaping proteins may be targets of viral proteins [5] [6] [7]. This Pearl review will explore the virus-induced ER-membrane rearrangement and the relationship between ER-shaping proteins and the flavivirus life cycle.

EP  - 9
AB  - We have previously isolated and characterized two dengue (DEN) 2 viruses mutant in their fusion-from-within (FFWI) phenotype in the insect cell line C6/36. Both viruses lost a potential glycosylation site (Asn-153) in the envelope (E) glycoprotein. To determine whether the change in FFWI phenotype was due to a change in E-glycoprotein glycosylation, we characterized the patterns of glycosylation on the E-glycoprotein of wild-type DEN 1 and DEN 2 viruses. The E-glycoproteins were isolated from purified virus grown in Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells, by use of high-performance size-exclusion chromatography. The tryptic maps of wild-type glycosylated and enzymatically (PNGase F) deglycosylated E-glycoproteins were compared by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The DEN 1 virus E-glycoprotein was found to have two peaks in the tryptic map that exhibited shifts after deglycosylation, whereas the DEN 2 virus E-glycoprotein had only one. Besides the potential glycosylation site at Asn-153, both DEN 1 and DEN 2 virus E-glycoproteins have another potential site located at Asn-67. Amino-terminal sequencing of the shifted peaks revealed that DEN 2 virus E-glycoprotein is glycosylated only at Asn-67; however, DEN 1 virus E-glycoprotein is glycosylated at both Asn-67 and Asn-153. These DEN virus serotypes are thus heterogeneous in their use of glycosylation sites. We also determined by a lectin-binding assay that the attached carbohydrates for both viruses were likely to be of the high-mannose type.

JF  - Cell & Bioscience
VL  - 5
AB  - Aedes albopictus is an important vector of Dengue virus (DENV) and it has quickly invaded the tropical and temperate environments worldwide. A few studies have shown that, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate mosquito defense against pathogens. However, there is no systematic analysis of the impact of DENV infection on miRNA expression in Ae. albopictus. We conducted this study to investigate the miRNA expression of Ae. albopictus upon DENV-2 infection using Illumina RNA sequencing. A total of 103 known and 5 novel candidate miRNAs were identified in DENV-2 infected and non-infected adult female Ae. albopictus. Comparative analysis indicated that 52 miRNAs were significantly down-regulated and 18 were up-regulated significantly after infection. Furthermore, RT-qPCR validated the expression patterns of eleven of these differentially expressed miRNAs. Targets prediction and functional analysis of these regulated miRNAs suggested that miR-34-5p and miR-87 might be involved in the anti-pathogen and immune responses. This is the first systematic study on the impact of DENV infection on miRNA expression in Ae. albopictus. Complex changes in miRNA expression suggest a potential role of miRNAs in antiviral responses by regulating immune-related genes. This investigation provides information concerning DENV-induced miRNAs and offers clues for identifying potential candidates for vector based antiviral strategies.

AB  - The 5'-end of the flavivirus genome harbors a methylated (m7)GpppA(2'OMe) cap structure, which is generated by the virus-encoded RNA triphosphatase, RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase, nucleoside 2'-O-methyltransferase, and RNA guanylyltransferase. The presence of the flavivirus guanylyltransferase activity in NS5 has been suggested by several groups but has not been empirically proven. Here we provide evidence that the N-terminus of the flavivirus NS5 protein is a true RNA guanylyltransferase. We demonstrate that GTP can be used as a substrate by the enzyme to form a covalent GMP-enzyme intermediate via a phosphoamide bond. Mutational studies also confirm the importance of a specific lysine residue in the GTP binding site for the enzymatic activity. We show that the GMP moiety can be transferred to the diphosphate end of an RNA transcript harboring an adenosine as the initiating residue. We also demonstrate that the flavivirus RNA triphosphatase (NS3 protein) stimulates the RNA guanylyltransferase activity of the NS5 protein. Finally, we show that both enzymes are sufficient and necessary to catalyze the de novo formation of a methylated RNA cap structure in vitro using a triphosphorylated RNA transcript. Our study provides biochemical evidence that flaviviruses encode a complete RNA capping machinery.

JF  - Nucleic Acids Research
VL  - 48
SP  - 5081
EP  - 5093
AB  - Abstract Flaviviruses, including dengue virus and Zika virus, contain a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome that encodes viral proteins essential for replication and also serves as the template for new genome synthesis. As these processes move in opposite directions along the genome, translation must be inhibited at a defined point following infection to clear the template of ribosomes to allow efficient replication. Here, we demonstrate in vitro and in cell-based assays that the viral RNA polymerase, NS5, inhibits translation of the viral genome. By reconstituting translation in vitro using highly purified components, we show that this translation block occurs at the initiation stage and that translation inhibition depends on NS5-RNA interaction, primarily through association with the 5′ replication promoter region. This work supports a model whereby expression of a viral protein signals successful translation of the infecting genome, prompting a switch to a ribosome depleted replication-competent form.

AB  - BackgroundDengue viruses (DENV) attach to the host cell surface and subsequently enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Several primary and low affinity co-receptors for this flavivirus have been identified. However, the presence of these binding molecules on the cell surface does not necessarily render the cell susceptible to infection. Determination of which of them serve as bona fide receptors for this virus in the vector may be relevant to treating DENV infection and in designing control strategies.Results(1) Overlay protein binding assay showed two proteins with molecular masses of 80 and 67 kDa (R80 and R67). (2) Specific antibodies against these two proteins inhibited cell binding and infection. (3) Both proteins were bound by all four serotypes of dengue virus. (4) R80 and R67 were purified by affinity chromatography from Ae. aegypti mosquito midguts and from Ae albopictus C6/36 cells. (5) In addition, a protein with molecular mass of 57 kDa was purified by affinity chromatography from the midgut extracts. (6) R80 and R67 from radiolabeled surface membrane proteins of C6/36 cells were immunoprecipitated by antibodies against Ae. aegypti midgut.ConclusionOur results strongly suggest that R67 and R80 are receptors for the four serotypes of dengue virus in the midgut cells of Ae. aegypti and in C6/36 Ae. albopictus cells.

TI  - The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) interacts with dengue virus core protein.
JF  - DNA and cell biology
VL  - 20 9
SP  - 569
EP  - 77
AB  - Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), a component of hnRNP particles, is involved in several steps of gene expression regulation. Dengue (DEN) virus, a member of the Flaviviridae, is the primary cause of illnesses such as dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. In mature DEN virus particles, the core protein is a structural protein that forms a nucleocapsid complex with genomic RNA. Very little of its biologic functions is known. Here, using an in vitro binding assay and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, we report a protein-protein interaction between the DEN virus core protein and hnRNP K. The C-terminal hydrophilic region of the DEN virus core protein, spanning amino acid residues 73 to 100, is required for such interaction. Results of glutathione-S transferase binding assays indicated that the core protein-hnRNP K interaction might be abolished in the presence of hnRNP K cognate nucleic acids. Furthermore, in a cotransfection experiment, the repressive effect of hnRNP K on C/EBPbeta-mediated transcription activation could be reversed by full-length DEN virus core protein but not by a truncated form containing amino acids 1-72. Our results suggest that, on DEN virus infection, the multiple functions of cellular hnRNP K may be affected by the virus core protein.

TI  - The high-affinity human IgG receptor Fc gamma receptor I (FcγRI) is not associated with vascular leakage of dengue
JF  - Journal of Negative Results in Biomedicine
VL  - 14
AB  - BackgroundDengue is a major public health problem in many tropical and sub-tropical countries. Vascular leakage and shock are identified as the major causes of deaths in patients with severe dengue. Studies have suggested the potential role of Fc gamma receptors I (FcγRI) in the pathogenesis of dengue. We hypothesized that the circulating level of Fcγ receptor I could potentially be used as an indicator in assisting early diagnosis of severe dengue.ResultsA selected cohort of 66 dengue patients including 42 dengue with signs of vascular leakage, and 24 dengue without signs of vascular leakage were identified and were afterwards referred to as ‘cases’ and ‘controls’ respectively. Thirty seven normal healthy controls were also recruited in this study. The circulating level of FcγRI was quantified from the serum using enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of FcγRI in both groups of patients with and without vascular leakage were found to be significantly higher than the normal healthy controls (P < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference found between patients with vascular leakage and those without vascular leakage (p = 0.777).ConclusionWe suggest that FcγRI is not associated with the vascular leakage in dengue. However, further studies are necessary to delineate the role of FcγRI in antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) mechanism.

AB  - Scientific investigations designed to better understand and assess the distinguishing clinical characteristics pave the way to a successful treatment for a disease. Since the peripheral blood is obtained easily, the most frequent type of investigation performed on infectious agents focuses on the hematological components of blood drawn from patients. Bone marrow aspirates, although somewhat more difficult to obtain, should be evaluated more frequently because they provide additional information, giving us a glimpse into the development of the disease. Understanding the distinct and unique changes in hematological components of the bone marrow induced by a particular pathogen or corresponding to a specific illness may be a valuable asset for the diagnosis and prognosis of disease. A good example of a pathogen that could be better evaluated with greater knowledge of the bone marrow is dengue, one of the most important public vector-borne human diseases. Owing to the multitude of clinical manifestations and the dynamic alterations of various blood components over time, this disease is one of the most difficult to prevent and treat in humans. Although large amounts of data have been generated in the literature, there remains a large gap between this information and its relevance for the purpose of patient care. While evaluating the cellular components in the circulated blood from ill patients provides us with valuable information about the pathogenesis of various pathogens, there are other players participating in the progression to disease. The goal of this review is to emphasize the importance of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells in disease and to inspire other researchers to incorporate them into their investigations on dengue pathogenesis. It is anticipated that the knowledge derived from these investigations not only elicit original concepts on the pathogenesis of dengue but also foster a new way of thinking in terms of vaccine or therapeutic development to prevent and treat dengue.

TI  - The inflammasome pathway is activated by dengue virus non-structural protein 1 and is protective during dengue virus infection
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 20
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a medically important flavivirus causing an estimated 50–100 million dengue cases annually, some of whom progress to severe disease. DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected cells and has been implicated as a major driver of dengue pathogenesis by inducing endothelial barrier dysfunction. However, less is known about how DENV NS1 interacts with immune cells and what role these interactions play. Here we report that DENV NS1 can trigger activation of inflammasomes, a family of cytosolic innate immune sensors that respond to infectious and noxious stimuli, in mouse and human macrophages. DENV NS1 induces the release of IL-1β in a caspase-1 dependent manner. Additionally, we find that DENV NS1-induced inflammasome activation is independent of the NLRP3, Pyrin, and AIM2 inflammasome pathways, but requires CD14. Intriguingly, DENV NS1-induced inflammasome activation does not induce pyroptosis and rapid cell death; instead, macrophages maintain cellular viability while releasing IL-1β. Lastly, we show that caspase-1/11-deficient, but not NLRP3-deficient, mice are more susceptible to lethal DENV infection. Together, these results indicate that the inflammasome pathway acts as a sensor of DENV NS1 and plays a protective role during infection.

AB  - To investigate the role of the transcription factor p53 in the course of the dengue virus (DV) infection. The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell strain HepG2 with a low expression level of p53 was built by using the retroviral-mediated RNA interference technology, and was detected by Western blot. The wild group and the interference group were respectively infected by the type 2 DV. The viral titration was detected by the Vero plaque assay, the viral multiplication was detected by the immunofluorescence, the cell apoptosis after virus infection was detected by FCM and the level of IFN-β was analyzed by ELISA. Compared to the wild group, the expression level of p53 in the interference group decreased significantly, which indicated that the HepG2 cell strain with the low expression level of p53 was successfully built. 24h after DV infection, the virus titration in the interference group was 100 times higher than that in the wild group. The result of the immunofluorescence showed that, the amount of green fluorescent cells in the interference group was significant higher than that in the wild group. It was indicated that the DV infection was inhibited by p53. However, 24h after DV infection, there was no significant difference in the amount of apoptotic cells in both groups. And the amount of IFN-β in the wild group increased 6 times. The DV infection was inhibited by the transcription factor p53 by activating type I interferon pathway other than promoting the cell apoptosis.

TI  - The interaction of Orthoflavivirus nonstructural proteins 3 and 5 with human fatty acid synthase
JF  - PLOS One
VL  - 20
AB  - Mosquito-transmitted viruses of the genus Orthoflavivirus impose a significant public health burden in many tropical and sub-tropical countries around the world, yet there is still no therapeutic drug to treat infection by any of these viruses, and so a deeper understanding of the mechanism of viral replication is required to identify potential therapeutic targets. Studies have shown that lipid metabolism is modulated upon virus infection, and that fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis. In particular it has been reported that FASN interacts with DENV NS3 and is subsequently located to the replication complex. To further investigate this, the interaction of FASN with NS3 and NS5 of the Orthoflaviviruses dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) was investigated by coimmunoprecipitation and indirect immunofluorescent assay. Unexpectedly, FASN interacted with both NS3 and NS5 independently. The colocalization of NS3 and FASN was found for all investigated viruses, and while NS5 interacted with FASN, colocalization was not observed. Markedly however, FASN colocalized with dsRNA, a marker for the replication complex. FASN is an essential enzyme and plays a role in viral replication complex and cellular membrane remodelling. The interaction of FASN with both NS3 and NS5, as well as some of FASN being localized to the site of replication for DENV, JEV and ZIKV further highlights FASN as an important therapeutic target which may have applications to many mosquito-transmitted Orthoflaviviruses.

TI  - The interaction of dengue virus capsid protein with negatively charged interfaces drives the in vitro assembly of nucleocapsid-like particles
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 17
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes a major arthropod-borne viral disease, with 2.5 billion people living in risk areas. DENV consists in a 50 nm-diameter enveloped particle in which the surface proteins are arranged with icosahedral symmetry, while information about nucleocapsid (NC) structural organization is lacking. DENV NC is composed of the viral genome, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA, packaged by the capsid (C) protein. Here, we established the conditions for a reproducible in vitro assembly of DENV nucleocapsid-like particles (NCLPs) using recombinant DENVC. We analyzed NCLP formation in the absence or presence of oligonucleotides in solution using small angle X-ray scattering, Rayleigh light scattering as well as fluorescence anisotropy, and characterized particle structural properties using atomic force and transmission electron microscopy imaging. The experiments in solution comparing 2-, 5- and 25-mer oligonucleotides established that 2-mer is too small and 5-mer is sufficient for the formation of NCLPs. The assembly process was concentration-dependent and showed a saturation profile, with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (DENVC:oligonucleotide) molar ratio, suggesting an equilibrium involving DENVC dimer and an organized structure compatible with NCLPs. Imaging methods proved that the decrease in concentration to sub-nanomolar concentrations of DENVC allows the formation of regular spherical NCLPs after protein deposition on mica or carbon surfaces, in the presence as well as in the absence of oligonucleotides, in this latter case being surface driven. Altogether, the results suggest that in vitro assembly of DENV NCLPs depends on DENVC charge neutralization, which must be a very coordinated process to avoid unspecific aggregation. Our hypothesis is that a specific highly positive spot in DENVC α4-α4’ is the main DENVC-RNA binding site, which is required to be firstly neutralized to allow NC formation.

TI  - The liver X receptor agonist LXR 623 restricts flavivirus replication
JF  - Emerging Microbes & Infections
VL  - 10
SP  - 1378
EP  - 1389
AB  - ABSTRACT The vector-borne flaviviruses (VBFVs) are well known for causing great misery and death in humans worldwide. The VBFVs include those transmitted by mosquitos, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus; and those transmitted by ticks including the tick-borne flavivirus serocomplex and Powassan virus (POWV). Two of our recent reports showed that intracranial POWV infection in the reservoir host, Peromyscus leucopus, was restricted and caused no overt clinical disease. Several modes of analyses suggested activation of the LXR pathway. Activation of the LXR pathway leads to increased efflux of cholesterol from cells and consequent disturbances in membrane biogenesis. Because VBFV replication is dependent on membrane biogenesis, we evaluated the effect of an LXR agonist (LXR623) on POWV and ZIKV infection and observed that the compound impaired permissive replication of both viruses in a human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line. The LXR agonist resulted in failure of the viruses to induce ER expansion and elaborate vesicle formation, suggesting that the efflux of cholesterol was part of the antiviral mechanism. We also observed that the LXR agonist contributed to the mechanism of virus suppression by increased expression of mRNAs encoding for the antiviral cytokines CXCL10, RANTES and IFN1β. In sharp contrast, a LXR antagonist (GSK2033) had no significant effect on VBFV replication. We conclude that LXR623 impairs flavivirus replication by stimulating cellular antiviral factors.

TI  - The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 is essential for Dengue virus infection
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes the most prevalent and rapidly spreading arboviral disease of humans. It enters human cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Numerous cell surface proteins have been proposed as DENV entry factors. Among these, the phosphatidylserine receptor TIM-1 is the only one known to mediate virus internalization. However, several cellular models lacking TIM-1 are permissive to DENV infection, suggesting that other receptors exist. Here we show that the Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) binds DENV virions by interacting with the DIII of the viral envelope glycoprotein. DENV infection is effectively inhibited by the purified receptor at 5×10−8 mol/L and the interaction of the envelope protein with LRP1 is also blocked by a natural ligand of LRP1. Depletion of LRP1 causes 100-fold lower production of infectious virus than controls. Our results indicate that LRP1 is another DENV receptor thus, becoming an attractive target to evaluate for the development of effective antiviral drugs against DENV. Author summary Dengue virus (DENV) is a complex of four related viruses, recognized as serotypes, designated as DENV1-4. Any of the four DENV serotypes can cause a self-limited disease of mild flu-like symptoms known as dengue or its life threatening form, severe dengue, with hemorrhagic manifestations, organ impairment and shock. This disease is widely spread in tropical and sub-tropical areas worldwide, where the incidence of severe dengue has been increasing steadily. So far, efforts that target components of the viral replication machinery in order to develop a specific antiviral drug for dengue disease patients have failed. Thus, identifying the cell surface receptors used by DENV to enter host cells would provide a new molecular target to develop inhibitory drugs. Here, we evaluate the Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) as a putative DENV receptor. We present evidence demonstrating that LRP1 binds DENV through the viral envelope protein. We show that the production of infective virus is impaired on cells lacking LRP1, and that purified LRP1 is a potent blocker of DENV infection. These results are consistent with LRP1 playing an important role on DENV entry, making this receptor a molecule of interest on the investigation for medical treatments of dengue/severe dengue disease.

TI  - The microbiome composition of Aedes aegypti is not critical for Wolbachia-mediated inhibition of dengue virus
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 11
AB  - Background Dengue virus (DENV) is primarily vectored by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, and is estimated to cause 390 million human infections annually. A novel method for DENV control involves stable transinfection of Ae. aegypti with the common insect endosymbiont Wolbachia, which mediates an antiviral effect. However, the mechanism by which Wolbachia reduces the susceptibility of Ae. aegypti to DENV is not fully understood. In this study we assessed the potential of resident microbiota, which can play important roles in insect physiology and immune responses, to affect Wolbachia-mediated DENV blocking. Methodology/Findings The microbiome of Ae. aegypti stably infected with Wolbachia strain wMel was compared to that of Ae. aegypti without Wolbachia, using 16s rDNA profiling. Our results indicate that although Wolbachia affected the relative abundance of several genera, the microbiome of both the Wolbachia-infected and uninfected mosquitoes was dominated by Elizabethkingia and unclassified Enterobacteriaceae. To assess the potential of the resident microbiota to affect the Wolbachia-mediated antiviral effect, we used antibiotic treatment before infection with DENV by blood-meal. In spite of a significant shift in the microbiome composition in response to the antibiotics, we detected no effect of antibiotic treatment on DENV infection rates, or on the DENV load of infected mosquitoes. Conclusions/Significance Our findings indicate that stable infection with Wolbachia strain wMel produces few effects on the microbiome of laboratory-reared Ae. aegypti. Moreover, our findings suggest that the microbiome can be significantly altered without affecting the fundamental DENV blocking phenotype in these mosquitoes. Since Ae. aegypti are likely to encounter diverse microbiota in the field, this is a particularly important result in the context of using Wolbachia as a method for DENV control.

TI  - The monocyte-macrophage-mast cell axis in dengue pathogenesis
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 25
AB  - Dengue virus, the causative agent of dengue disease which may have hemorrhagic complications, poses a global health threat. Among the numerous target cells for dengue virus in humans are monocytes, macrophages and mast cells which are important regulators of vascular integrity and which undergo dramatic cellular responses after infection by dengue virus. The strategic locations of these three cell types, inside blood vessels (monocytes) or outside blood vessels (macrophages and mast cells) allow them to respond to dengue virus infection with the production of both intracellular and secretory factors which affect virus replication, vascular permeability and/or leukocyte extravasation. Moreover, the expression of Fc receptors on the surface of monocytes, macrophages and mast cells makes them important target cells for antibody-enhanced dengue virus infection which is a major risk factor for severe dengue disease, involving hemorrhage. Collectively, these features of monocytes, macrophages and mast cells contribute to both beneficial and harmful responses of importance to understanding and controlling dengue infection and disease.

EP  - 26
AB  - When Aedes albopictus larvae were infected with C6/36 densovirus (C6/36DNV), the mortality reached 97.46% within 21 days for those larvae infected at the first day after hatching, and 14.17% for control. A real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to trace the dynamic change of the quantity of C6/36DNV genomes in the larvae and the adults, and to study the interaction of C6/36DNV with dengue virus type II(DEN-II) in mosquitoes. It showed that C6/36DNV could persist in the adults that could transmit C6/36DNV vertically to the next generation. The quantity of C6/36DNV after DEN-II infection increased by 10(2)~10(3) times in the C6/36DNV-positive mosquitoes, and the quantity of DEN-II in the C6/36DNV-positive mosquitoes was about 100 times lower than that in the C6/36DNV-negative mosquitoes, which suggested that DEN-II could remarkably stimulate the reproduction of C6/36DNV, while C6/36DNV persisted in mosquitoes could inhibit the reproduction of DEN-II. The study throws light on C6/36DNV as a possible biologic control agent against dengue virus and Ae. albopictus.

TI  - The polymorphic landscape analysis of GATA1 exons uncovered the genetic variants associated with higher thrombocytopenia in dengue patients
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 16
AB  - The current study elucidated an association between gene variants and thrombocytopenia through the investigation of the exonic polymorphic landscape of hematopoietic transcription factor—GATA1 gene in dengue patients. A total of 115 unrelated dengue patients with dengue fever (DF) (N = 91) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (N = 24) were included in the study. All dengue patients were confirmed through detection of NS1 antigen, IgM, and IgG antibodies against the dengue virus. Polymerase chain reaction using specific primers amplified the exonic regions of GATA1 while Sanger sequencing and chromatogram analyses facilitated the identification of variants. Variants G>A (at chX: 48792009) and C>A (at chX: 4879118) had higher frequency out of 13 variants identified (3 annotated and 10 newly recognized). Patients carrying either nonsynonymous or synonymous variants had significantly lower mean values of platelets compared to those harboring the reference nucleotides (NC_000023.11). Further analyses revealed that the change in amino acid residue leads to the altered three-dimensional structure followed by interaction with neighboring residues. Increased stability of the protein due to substitution of serine by asparagine (S129N at chX: 48792009) may cause increased rigidity followed by reduced structural flexibility which may ultimately disturb the dimerization (an important prerequisite for GATA1 to perform its biological activity) process of the GATA1 protein. This, in turn, may affect the function of GATA1 followed by impaired production of mature platelets which may be reflected by the lower platelet counts in individuals with such variation. In summary, we have identified new variants within the GATA1 gene which were found to be clinically relevant to the outcome of dengue patients and thus, have the potential as candidate biomarkers for the determination of severity and prognosis of thrombocytopenia caused by dengue virus. However, further validation of this study in a large number of dengue patients is warranted. Trial Registration: number SLCTR/2019/037.

AB  - Abstract In Bangkok, Thailand, 49 of 127 patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever experienced shock. The concentration of nine complement proteins measured in serial serum samples decreased during shock with the exception of C9. C3 and C5 were reduced to 20 to 40 per cent of normal in severe cases. Decrease of plasma fibrinogen, appearance of fibrinogen split products and thrombocytopenia indicated occurence of intravascular coagulation. Metabolic studies of C3 and C1q, performed on 24 patients, indicated a markedly enhanced fractional catabolic rate especially during shock. These results support the concept that activation of complement can constitute a major factor in the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic shock. (N Engl J Med 289:996–1000, 1973)

TI  - The potential role of Wolbachia in controlling the transmission of emerging human arboviral infections
JF  - Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases
VL  - 30
SP  - 108
EP  - 116
AB  - Purpose of review Wolbachia is a genus of Gram-negative intracellular bacteria that is naturally found in more than half of all arthropod species. These bacteria cannot only reduce the fitness and the reproductive capacities of arthropod vectors, but also increase their resistance to arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). This article reviews the evidence supporting a Wolbachia-based strategy for controlling the transmission of dengue and other arboviral infections. Recent findings Studies conducted 1 year after the field release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in Australia have demonstrated the suppression of dengue virus (DENV) replication in and dissemination by mosquitoes. Recent mathematical models show that this strategy could reduce the transmission of DENV by 70%. Consequently, the WHO is encouraging countries to boost the development and implementation of Wolbachia-based prevention strategies against other arboviral infections. However, the evidence regarding the efficacy of Wolbachia to prevent the transmission of other arboviral infections is still limited to an experimental framework with conflicting results in some cases. There is a need to demonstrate the efficacy of such strategies in the field under various climatic conditions, to select the Wolbachia strain that has the best pathogen interference/spread trade-off, and to continue to build community acceptance. Summary Wolbachia represents a promising tool for controlling the transmission of arboviral infections that needs to be developed further. Long-term environmental monitoring will be necessary for timely detection of potential changes in Wolbachia/vector/virus interactions.

TI  - The role of anti‐flavivirus humoral immune response in protection and pathogenesis
JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology
VL  - 30
AB  - Flavivirus infections are a public health threat in the world that requires the development of safe and effective vaccines. Therefore, the understanding of the anti‐flavivirus humoral immune response is fundamental to future studies on flavivirus pathogenesis and the design of anti‐flavivirus therapeutics. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of the function and involvement of flavivirus proteins in the humoral immune response as well as the ability of the anti‐envelope (anti‐E) antibodies to interfere (neutralizing antibodies) or not (non‐neutralizing antibodies) with viral infection, and how they can, in some circumstances enhance dengue virus infection on Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) bearing cells through a mechanism known as antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE). Thus, the dual role of the antibodies against E protein poses a formidable challenge for vaccine development. Also, we discuss the roles of antibody binding stoichiometry (the concentration, affinity, or epitope recognition) in the neutralization of flaviviruses and the “breathing” of flavivirus virions in the humoral immune response. Finally, the relevance of some specific antibodies in the design and improvement of effective vaccines is addressed.

JF  - Virulence
VL  - 4
SP  - 525
EP  - 536
AB  - The loss of the endothelium barrier and vascular leakage play a central role in the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic fever viruses. This can be caused either directly by the viral infection and damage of the vascular endothelium, or indirectly by a dysregulated immune response resulting in an excessive activation of the endothelium. This article briefly reviews our knowledge of the importance of the disruption of the vascular endothelial barrier in two severe disease syndromes, dengue hemorrhagic fever and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Both viruses cause changes in vascular permeability without damaging the endothelium. Here we focus on our understanding of the virus interaction with the endothelium, the role of the endothelium in the induced pathogenesis, and the possible mechanisms by which each virus causes vascular leakage. Understanding the dynamics between viral infection and the dysregulation of the endothelial cell barrier will help us to define potential therapeutic targets for reducing disease severity.

AB  - Dengue fever is a viral condition that has become a recurrent issue for public health in tropical countries, common endemic areas. Although viral structure and composition have been widely studied, the infection phenotype in terms of small molecules remains poorly established. This contribution providing a comprehensive overview of the metabolic implications of the virus-host interaction using a lipidomic-based approach through direct-infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry. Our results provide further evidence that lipids are part of both the immune response upon Dengue virus infection and viral infection maintenance mechanism in the organism. Furthermore, the species described herein provide evidence that such lipids may be part of the mechanism that leads to blood-related complications such as hemorrhagic fever, the severe form of the disease.

TI  - The role of mediator suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) on cytokine production during dengue virus infection
JF  - Narra J
VL  - 3
AB  - Inability to understand the pathogenesis of severe dengue, in particular the control mechanism of immune responses, has led to high mortality rate for patients with dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The aim of this study was to determine the control mechanism of cytokine production by mediator suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) during DENV infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear blood cells (PBMC), isolated from healthy individuals, were infected with dengue virus (DENV)-2 strain SJN-006 Cosmopolitan genotype (isolated from Bali, Indonesia). The relative gene expression of SOCS-3, TLR-3, NFκB, and the cytokine genes (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, interferon inducible protein 10 (IP-10), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β)) were measured using qRT-PCR at 6, 12 and 24 hours post infection (hpi). Student t-test and Mann-Whitney test were used to compare the gene expressions while causal correlations were analyzed using regression test and path analyses. DENV-2 infection increased the gene expression of SOCS-3, TLR-3, and NFκB after 12 and 24 hpi. The expression of IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, and MIP-1β genes was increased and peaked at different times post-infection. NFκB and SOCS-3 genes likely have role in the upregulation of IL-8 and IL-6 gene expression, respectively. MIP-1β gene expression was significantly induced by both NFκB and SOCS-3. In conclusion, our study suggested that SOCS-3, TLR-3, and NFκB are important in regulating the production of IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, MIP-1β during early phase of DENV-2 infection. This enriches our understanding on pathogenesis pathway of DENV-associated cytokine storm.

AB  - Structure‐based mutagenesis analysis on selected conserved surface basic residues of DENV NS3 helicase was performed using a selectable replicon and recombinant protein. We found a requirement for basic side chains of NS3 residues #225, #268, and #538 to activate viral RNA replication and ensure RNA‐stimulated ATPase activity, and a critical role for R560 and R599 residues in maintaining NS3 helicase structure, linked to its biological function and catalytic activity. Three screened NS3 second‐site mutations for R225A and R268A/E mutations elevated the functional RNA binding of NS3 helicase and compensated the replication defect of the original NS3 mutant replicons.

TI  - The role of the unfolded protein response in dengue virus pathogenesis
AB  - Symptomatic dengue virus (DENV) infections range from mild fever to severe haemorrhagic disease and death. Host‐viral interactions play a significant role in deciding the fate of the infection. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a prosurvival cellular reaction induced in response to DENV‐mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress. The UPR has complex interactions with the cellular autophagy machinery, apoptosis, and innate immunity. DENV has evolved to manipulate the UPR to facilitate its replication and to evade host immunity. Our knowledge of this intertwined network of events is continuously developing. A better understanding of the UPR mediated antiviral and proviral effects will shed light on dengue disease pathogenesis and may help development of anti‐DENV therapeutics. This review summarizes the role of the UPR in viral replication, autophagy, and DENV‐induced inflammation to describe how a host response contributes to DENV pathogenesis.

TI  - The secretory fate of flavivirus NS1 in mosquito cells is influenced by the caveolin binding domain
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Flaviviruses of major medical importance worldwide such as dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and yellow fever (YFV) viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes Aedes sp. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of these flaviviruses is secreted from the infected cells using different secretion routes depending on the cell and virus nature. The NS1 of DENV and ZIKV contain in the hydrophobic region a conserved caveolin binding domain (CBD) (ΦXXΦXXXXΦ), which is not conserved in YFV NS1. To ascertain the role of the CBD in the secretory route followed by flavivirus NS1, expression vectors for the NS1 of DENV2, ZIKV and YFV were constructed. Using site-directed mutagenesis, substitutions were made in the aromatic residues within CBD; in addition, the full domain was replaced by those of other flaviviruses, creating chimeras in the CBD of NS1. Substitutions of the aromatic residues to Ala or Thr, or CBD chimeras, results in increased sensitivity of NS1 secretion to brefeldin A treatment, indicating a change to a classical secretion pathway. Likewise, the insertion of the DENV/ZIKV CBD into the recombinant Gaussia-Luciferase results in a loss of sensitivity to BFA treatment, in luciferase secretion. These results suggest that the CBD sequence is a molecular determinant for the unconventional secretory route followed by DENV and ZIKV NS1 in mosquito cells. However, the cellular components that recognize the CBD in the NS1 of DENV and ZIKV and redirect them to an unconventional route and if this secretion route confers unique functions to NS1 within the vector mosquito are aspects currently unknown. Importance Flaviviruses are an important cause of mosquito borne diseases to humans. We have previously demonstrated that the non-structural protein 1 from dengue and zika virus are secreted efficiently from mosquito cells using an unconventional route, that depends on caveolin and molecular chaperones. In this work, we show evidence indicating that a caveolin binding domain, well conserved and exposed in dengue and Zika virus NS1, but absent in other flaviviruses such as yellow fever virus or West Nile virus, is important in determining the unconventional secretion pathway followed by dengue and zika virus NS1 in mosquito cells. The unique secretory pathway followed by NS1 in mosquito cells may result in distinctive viral-cellular protein associations required to facilitate viral infection in the mosquito vector. To identify viral and cellular elements that could disturb the traffic of dengue and Zika virus NS1 may be important to design of strategies for vector control.

AB  - Viruses hijack host machineries for replicating themselves efficiently. Host protein quality control machineries (QC) not only assist protein folding to form bona fide proteins with active functions but also get rid of un/misfolded proteins via degradation to maintain the protein homeostasis. Previous studies have reported that viruses utilize QC at various steps for their lifecycles. Recently we defined Hsp70s and their cochaperones, DnaJs functions on Dengue lifecycle. Here we summarize the significance of QC on Dengue virus.

JF  - Journal of proteome research

EP  - 71
AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are the most severe forms of dengue virus infection with hemorrhage and plasma leakage. However, pathogenic mechanisms of DHF and DSS remain poorly understood. We therefore investigated host responses as determined by changes in the cellular proteome of primary human endothelial cells upon infection with dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN-2) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for 24 h. Two-dimensional PAGE and quantitative intensity analysis revealed 38 significantly altered protein spots (16 upregulated and 22 downregulated) in DEN-2-infected cells compared to mock controls. These altered proteins were successfully identified by mass spectrometry, including those involved in oxidative stress response, transcription and translation, cytoskeleton assembly, protein degradation, cell growth regulation, apoptosis, cellular metabolism, and antiviral response. The proteomic data were validated by Western blot analyses [upregulated ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (UBE1) and downregulated annexin A2] and an immunofluorescence study (upregulated MxA). Interestingly, we found that MxA was colocalized with DEN-2 viral capsid protein, strengthening its role as an antiviral protein. Moreover, we also identified upregulation of a proteasome subunit. Our functional study revealed the significant role of ubiquitination in dengue infection and UBE1 inhibition by its specific inhibitor (UBEI-41) caused a significant reduction in the level of viral protein synthesis and its infectivity. Our findings suggest that various biological processes were triggered in response to dengue infection, particularly antiviral IFN and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways.

TI  - The zinc finger protein ZFP36L2 inhibits flavivirus infection via the 5′-3′ XRN1-mediated RNA decay pathway in the replication complexes
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 32
AB  - Background The zinc finger protein 36-like (ZFP36L) family is a CCCH-type group consisting of RNA-binding proteins, i.e., ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2, which regulate cellular mRNA through the RNA decay pathway. ZFP36L1 combats flavivirus infections through the 5′-3′ XRN1 and 3′-5′ RNA exosome decay pathways. The present study clarified the role of human ZFP36L2 in the defense response of the host against flavivirus infection. Methods Cell lines with overexpression or knockdown of ZFP36L2 were established using lentiviral vectors carrying genes for overexpression and short-hairpin RNA targeting specific genes, respectively. A plaque assay was employed to determine the viral titer. Immunofluorescence and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to measure the viral RNA levels. The in vitro-transcribed RNA transcript derived from a replication-dead Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) replicon containing the renilla luciferase reporter gene (J-R2A-NS5mt) was used to assess the stability of the flavivirus RNA. An RNA immunoprecipitation assay was used to detect the protein–RNA binding ability. Confocal microscopic images were captured to analyze protein colocalization. Results ZFP36L2 served as an innate host defender against JEV and dengue virus. ZFP36L2 inhibited flavivirus infection solely through the 5′-3′ XRN1 RNA decay pathway, whereas ZFP36L1 inhibited JEV infection via the 5′-3′ XRN1 and 3′-5′ RNA exosome RNA decay pathways. The direct binding between viral RNA and ZFP36L2 via its CCCH-type zinc finger motifs facilitated the degradation of flavivirus RNA mediated by 5′-3′ XRN1. Furthermore, ZFP36L2 was localized in processing bodies (PBs), which participate in the 5′-3′ XRN1-mediated RNA decay pathway. Nonetheless, the disruption of PBs did not affect the antiviral activity of ZFP36L2, suggesting that its localization is not essential for the function of the protein. Interestingly, the colocalization of ZFP36L2 and XRN1 with viral RNA and NS3 revealed that the antiviral activity of ZFP36L2 occurred within the replication complexes (RCs). Conclusions In summary, ZFP36L2 bound to and degraded viral RNA through the XRN1-mediated RNA decay pathway in the RCs, thereby inhibiting flavivirus replication. These findings provide valuable insights into the diverse antiviral mechanisms of the ZFP36-like family of proteins in the innate immune response against flavivirus infection.

JF  - Nucleic Acids Research

EP  - 7138
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFVs) including dengue, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses have an RNA genome encoding one open reading frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). The 3′ UTRs of MBFVs contain regions of high sequence conservation in structured RNA elements known as dumbbells (DBs) that regulate translation and replication of the viral RNA genome, functions proposed to depend on the formation of an RNA pseudoknot. To understand how DB structure provides this function, we used x-ray crystallography and structural modeling to reveal the details of its three-dimensional fold. The structure confirmed the predicted pseudoknot and molecular modeling revealed how conserved sequences form a four-way junction that appears to stabilize the pseudoknot. Single-molecule FRET suggests that the DB pseudoknot is a stable element that can regulate the switch between translation and replication during the viral lifecycle by modulating long-range RNA conformational changes.

TI  - Thrombocytopenia in dengue infection: mechanisms and a potential application
JF  - Expert Reviews in Molecular Medicine
VL  - 26
AB  - Thrombocytopenia is a common symptom and one of the warning signs of dengue virus (DENV) infection. Platelet depletion is critical as it may lead to other severe dengue symptoms. Understanding the molecular events of this condition during dengue infection is challenging because of the multifaceted factors involved in DENV infection and the dynamics of the disease progression. Platelet levels depend on the balance between platelet production and platelet consumption or clearance. Megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, two interdependent processes in platelet production, are hampered during dengue infection. Conversely, platelet elimination via platelet activation, apoptosis and clearance processes are elevated. Together, these anomalies contribute to thrombocytopenia in dengue patients. Targeting the molecular events of dengue-mediated thrombocytopenia shows great potential but still requires further investigation. Nonetheless, the application of new knowledge in this field, such as immature platelet fraction analysis, may facilitate physicians in monitoring the progression of the disease.

TI  - Tissue plasminogen activator induced by dengue virus infection of human endothelial cells
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 70
AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) are severe complications of dengue virus (DV) infection. However, the pathogenesis of hemorrhage induced by dengue virus infection is poorly understood. Since endothelial cells play a pivotal role in the regulation of hemostasis, we studied the effect of DV infection on the production of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI‐1) in vitro using both primary isolated endothelial cells, human umbilical cord veins cells, and a human microvascular endothelial cell line. DV infection significantly induced the secretion of tPA but not PAI‐1 of human endothelial cells. In addition, tPA mRNA of endothelial cells was induced by DV as demonstrated by RT‐PCR. Antibody against IL‐6 but not control antibody inhibited DV‐induced tPA production of endothelial cells. Furthermore, a good correlation between sera levels of IL‐6 and tPA was found in DHF but not DF patients. These results suggest that IL‐6 can regulate DV‐induced tPA production of endothelial cells, which may play important roles in the pathogenic development of DHF/DSS. J. Med.

TI  - Toll-Like receptor 3 genetic polymorphism in dengue encephalitis
JF  - Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care
VL  - 13
SP  - 2397
EP  - 2403
AB  - ABSTRACT Context: Dengue is one of the important vector-borne viral diseases affecting humans with diverse manifestations. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are pattern recognition receptors and play an important role in innate immunity against microbes. TLR3 plays a critical role in controlling the innate immune response mediated by flaviviruses such as dengue. Aim: We attempted to study the susceptibility of single nucleotide polymorphism of the TLR3 gene in dengue encephalitis (DE) patients and determine the association in terms of genotype, allele, and haplotype distribution along with the clinical outcome. Settings and Design: It was a case-controlled observational study in a tertiary care hospital. Methods and Material: We investigated the single nucleotide polymorphism in the TLR3 Leu412Phe gene using real-time polymerase chain reaction in 29 cases of DE and compared them with equal number of age- and sex-matched dengue patients without neurological features. Statistical Analysis Used: The genotype and allele frequencies were compared using a two-sided Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. Results: The findings revealed that the genotypic distribution of TLR3 Leu412Phe polymorphism for the mutant genotype Phe/Phe (TT) demonstrated increased association of DE (31.03% vs 6.8%, P 0.019, odds ratio 6.075, 95% confidence interval 1.181–31.245). However, the number of heterozygous (H) genotype (Leu/Phe–CT) and mutant Phe allele (T) did not show any statistically significant association. TLR3 gene polymorphism did not show any correlation with mortality outcome at 1 month. Conclusion: The presence of mutant TLR3 Leu412Phe polymorphism may confer the propensity to have DE in patients with dengue infection in the Indian population. TLR3 polymorphism did not affect mortality outcome at 1 month.

TI  - Toll-like receptor 4 in acute viral infection: Too much of a good thing
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - Although a well-regulated inflammatory response is a vital defense mechanism against viral infection, too much inflammation can be detrimental. Excessive inflammatory responses, which are characterized by elevated levels of a broad array of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, have been observed in a wide variety of viral diseases associated with serious morbidity and mortality. Examples of this include acute lung injury caused by infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (IAV), or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Excessive inflammatory responses induced by viral infections are not restricted to the lung but can be systemic, as reported for Ebola virus (EBOV) disease and severe dengue [1–5]. The reasons leading to an unbalanced inflammatory response in certain viral infections are not well understood and are most likely multifactorial. Here, we explore the role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the induction of damaging inflammatory responses during acute viral infections.

AB  - Differential viral recognition by cells bearing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) polymorphisms Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile may influence susceptibility and severity of dengue virus infection. In central Java, Indonesia, we investigated 201 children with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and 179 healthy controls. Patients and controls were mostly ethnic Javanese. A nearly complete cosegregation of the two mutations was observed. The TLR4 299/399 genotype was found in five patients and four controls. Prevalence of the TLR4 299/399 genotype did not differ significantly between controls and DHF patients or between patients with different severities of DHF. Also, vascular leakage in patients with different TLR4 genotypes did not differ. Thus, the 299/399 TLR4 haplotype has only minor influence on susceptibility and severity of complicated dengue virus infection.

TI  - Topoisomerase III-ß is required for efficient replication of positive-sense RNA viruses
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Based on genome-scale loss-of-function screens we discovered that Topoisomerase III-ß (TOP3B), a human topoisomerase that acts on DNA and RNA, is required for yellow fever virus and dengue virus-2 replication. Remarkably, we found that TOP3B is required for efficient replication of all positive-sense-single stranded RNA viruses tested, including SARS-CoV-2. While there are no drugs that specifically inhibit this topoisomerase, we posit that TOP3B is an attractive anti-viral target.

TI  - Toward a Categorization of Virus-ncRNA Interactions in the World of RNA to Disentangle the Tiny Secrets of Dengue Virus
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 16
AB  - In recent years, the function of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) as regulatory molecules of cell physiology has begun to be better understood. Advances in viral molecular biology have shown that host ncRNAs, cellular factors, and virus-derived ncRNAs and their interplay are strongly disturbed during viral infections. Nevertheless, the folding of RNA virus genomes has also been identified as a critical factor in regulating canonical and non-canonical functions. Due to the influence of host ncRNAs and the structure of RNA viral genomes, complex molecular and cellular processes in infections are modulated. We propose three main categories to organize the current information about RNA–RNA interactions in some well-known human viruses. The first category shows examples of host ncRNAs associated with the immune response triggered in viral infections. Even though miRNAs introduce a standpoint, they are briefly presented to keep researchers moving forward in uncovering other RNAs. The second category outlines interactions between virus-host ncRNAs, while the third describes how the structure of the RNA viral genome serves as a scaffold for processing virus-derived RNAs. Our grouping may provide a comprehensive framework to classify ncRNA–host-cell interactions for emerging viruses and diseases. In this sense, we introduced them to organize DENV–host-cell interactions.

TI  - Trafficking and Replication Patterns Reveal Splenic Macrophages as Major Targets of Dengue Virus in Mice
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 12138
EP  - 12147
AB  - ABSTRACT Human postmortem studies of natural dengue virus (DENV) infection have reported systemically distributed viral antigen. Although it is widely accepted that DENV infects mononuclear phagocytes, the sequence in which specific tissues and cell types are targeted remains uncharacterized. We previously reported that mice lacking alpha/beta and gamma interferon receptors permit high levels of DENV replication and show signs of systemic disease (T. R. Prestwood et al., J. Virol. 82:8411–8421, 2008). Here we demonstrate that within 6 h, DENV traffics to and replicates in both CD169+ and SIGN-R1+ macrophages of the splenic marginal zone or draining lymph node, respectively, following intravenous or intrafootpad inoculation. Subsequently, high levels of replication are detected in F4/80+ splenic red pulp macrophages and in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches. Intravenously inoculated mice begin to succumb to dengue disease 72 h after infection, at which time viral replication occurs systemically, except in lymphoid tissues. In particular, high levels of replication occur in CD68+ macrophages of the kidneys, heart, thymus, and gastrointestinal tract. Over the course of infection, proportionately large quantities of DENV traffic to the liver and spleen. However, late during infection, viral trafficking to the spleen decreases, while trafficking to the liver, thymus, and kidneys increases. The present study demonstrates that macrophage populations, initially in the spleen and other lymphoid tissues and later in nonlymphoid tissues, are major targets of DENV infection in vivo.

TI  - Transcriptional Activation of Interferon-Stimulated Genes but Not of Cytokine Genes after Primary Infection of Rhesus Macaques with Dengue Virus Type 1
JF  - Clinical and Vaccine Immunology
VL  - 14
SP  - 756
EP  - 766
AB  - ABSTRACT Macaques are the only animal model used to test dengue virus (DENV) vaccine candidates. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of DENV in macaques is not well understood. In this work, by using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays, we studied the broad transcriptional modifications and cytokine expression profile after infecting rhesus macaques with DENV serotype 1. Five days after infection, these animals produced a potent, innate antiviral immune response by inducing the transcription of signature genes from the interferon (IFN) pathway with demonstrated antiviral activity, such as myxoprotein, 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase, phospholipid scramblase 1, and viperin. Also, IFN regulatory element 7, IFN-stimulated gene 15, and protein ligases linked to the ISGylation process were up-regulated. Unexpectedly, no up-regulation of IFN-α, -β, or -γ genes was detected. Transcription of the genes of interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha was neither up-regulated nor down-regulated. Results were confirmed by real-time PCR and by multiplex cytokine detection in serum samples.

TI  - Transcriptional Profiling Confirms the Therapeutic Effects of Mast Cell Stabilization in a Dengue Disease Model
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT There are no approved therapeutics for the treatment of dengue disease despite the global prevalence of dengue virus (DENV) and its mosquito vectors. DENV infections can lead to vascular complications, hemorrhage, and shock due to the ability of DENV to infect a variety of immune and nonimmune cell populations. Increasingly, studies have implicated the host response as a major contributor to severe disease. Inflammatory products of various cell types, including responding T cells, mast cells (MCs), and infected monocytes, can contribute to immune pathology. In this study, we show that the host response to DENV infection in immunocompetent mice recapitulates transcriptional changes that have been described in human studies. We found that DENV infection strongly induced metabolic dysregulation, complement signaling, and inflammation. DENV also affected the immune cell content of the spleen and liver, enhancing NK, NKT, and CD8+ T cell activation. The MC-stabilizing drug ketotifen reversed many of these responses without suppressing memory T cell formation and induced additional changes in the transcriptome and immune cell composition of the spleen, consistent with reduced inflammation. This study provides a global transcriptional map of immune activation in DENV target organs of an immunocompetent host and supports the further development of targeted immunomodulatory strategies to treat DENV disease. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV), which causes febrile illness, is transmitted by mosquito vectors throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Symptoms of DENV infection involve damage to blood vessels and, in rare cases, hemorrhage and shock. Currently, there are no targeted therapies to treat DENV infection, but it is thought that drugs that target the host immune response may be effective in limiting symptoms that result from excessive inflammation. In this study, we measured the host transcriptional response to infection in multiple DENV target organs using a mouse model of disease. We found that DENV infection induced metabolic dysregulation and inflammatory responses and affected the immune cell content of the spleen and liver. The use of the mast cell stabilization drug ketotifen reversed many of these responses and induced additional changes in the transcriptome and immune cell repertoire that contribute to decreased dengue disease.

TI  - Transcriptional Regulation of the Interleukin-8 Promoter by Multiple Dengue Viral Proteins: A Dissertation
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes over 500,000 infections annually with a spectrum of clinical diseases ranging from subclinical infection to dengue, a mild febrile illness, to life-threatening severe dengue. Vascular leakage without endothelial cell damage is the hallmark symptom of severe dengue illness and is proposed to be directly mediated by soluble inflammatory mediators IL-8 and TNFα. IL-8 production occurs in response to DENV infection, is elevated during severe dengue, is proposed to inhibit interferon, and could potentially recruit target cells to sites of infection. We previously showed that expression of DENV NS5 activates the IL-8 promoter, induces IL-8 transcription, and induces IL-8 protein production in HepG2 and HEK293A cell lines. As multiple DENV proteins are reported to interact with important signaling pathways, we hypothesized that other DENV proteins could contribute to the activation of IL-8. We found that plasmids expressing prM-E together, the GPI-linked variant of NS1 (NS1G), the carboxyl-terminal 112 amino acids of NS4B, as well as NS5 each induced expression from an IL-8 promoter-driven reporter plasmid. Expression of NS5 also induced activation of a RANTES promoter construct and TNFα mRNA expression. Further, we found that the carboxyl-terminal polymerase domain of NS5 was sufficient to induce IL-8 secretion but polymerase function was not required. Like NS5, prM-E and NS1G induced luciferase expression from an AP-1-driven reporter plasmid. We further tested whether activation of the IL-8 promoter depended on any single transcription factor within IL-8 using IL-8 promoter-driven plasmids mutated at the AP-1, C/EBP or NF-κB binding sites. We found that activation of the IL-8 promoter by prM-E, NS1G and NS4B did not depend on

TI  - Transcriptional Response of Wolbachia to Dengue Virus Infection in Cells of the Mosquito Aedes aegypti
JF  - mSphere
VL  - 6
AB  - Aedes aegypti is a vector of several pathogenic viruses, including dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, which are of importance to human health. Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium currently used in transinfected mosquitoes to suppress replication and transmission of dengue viruses. However, the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus inhibition is not fully understood. ABSTRACT Aedes aegypti transmits one of the most significant mosquito‐borne viruses, dengue virus (DENV). The absence of effective vaccines and clinical treatments and the emergence of insecticide resistance in A. aegypti necessitate novel vector control strategies. A new approach uses the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis to reduce the spread of arboviruses. However, the Wolbachia-mediated antiviral mechanism is not well understood. To shed light on this mechanism, we investigated an unexplored aspect of Wolbachia-virus-mosquito interaction. We used RNA sequencing to examine the transcriptional response of Wolbachia to DENV infection in A. aegypti Aag2 cells transinfected with the wAlbB strain of Wolbachia. Our results suggest that genes encoding an endoribonuclease (RNase HI), a regulator of sigma 70-dependent gene transcription (6S RNA), essential cellular, transmembrane, and stress response functions and primary type I and IV secretion systems were upregulated, while a number of transport and binding proteins of Wolbachia, ribosome structure, and elongation factor-associated genes were downregulated due to DENV infection. Furthermore, bacterial retrotransposon, transposable, and phage-related elements were found among the up- and downregulated genes. We show that Wolbachia elicits a transcriptional response to virus infection and identify differentially expressed Wolbachia genes mostly at the early stages of virus infection. These findings highlight Wolbachia’s ability to alter its gene expression in response to DENV infection of the host cell. IMPORTANCE Aedes aegypti is a vector of several pathogenic viruses, including dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, which are of importance to human health. Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium currently used in transinfected mosquitoes to suppress replication and transmission of dengue viruses. However, the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus inhibition is not fully understood. While several studies have shown mosquitoes’ transcriptional responses to dengue virus infection, none have investigated these responses in Wolbachia, which may provide clues to the inhibition mechanism. Our results suggest changes in the expression of a number of functionally important Wolbachia genes upon dengue virus infection, including those involved in stress responses, providing insights into the endosymbiont’s reaction to virus infection.

TI  - Transcriptional and Translational Dynamics of Zika and Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are members of the Flaviviridae family of RNA viruses and cause severe disease in humans. ZIKV and DENV share over 90% of their genome sequences, however, the clinical features of Zika and dengue infections are very different reflecting tropism and cellular effects. Here, we used simultaneous RNA sequencing and ribosome footprinting to define the transcriptional and translational dynamics of ZIKV and DENV infection in human neuronal progenitor cells (hNPCs). The gene expression data showed induction of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARS) and the translation activating PIM1 kinase, indicating an increase in RNA translation capacity. The data also reveal activation of different cell stress responses, with ZIKV triggering a BACH1/2 redox program, and DENV activating the ATF/CHOP endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress program. The RNA translation data highlight activation of polyamine metabolism through changes in key enzymes and their regulators. This pathway is needed for eIF5A hypusination and has been implicated in viral translation and replication. Concerning the viral RNA genomes, ribosome occupancy readily identified highly translated open reading frames and a novel upstream ORF (uORF) in the DENV genome. Together, our data highlight both the cellular stress response and the activation of RNA translation and polyamine metabolism during DENV and ZIKV infection.

TI  - Transcriptional profiles of functionally distinct HLADR+CD38+ CD8 T cells subsets from acute febrile dengue patients
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Previous studies showed that a discrete population of the CD8 T cells with HLADR+CD38+ phenotype expand massively during the acute febrile phase of dengue natural infection. Although about a third of these massively expanding HLADR+CD38+ CD8 T cells were of CD69high phenotype, only a small fraction of them produced IFNγ upon in vitro peptide stimulation. What other cytokines/ chemokines do these peptides stimulated HLADR+CD38+ CD8 T cells express, what transcriptional profiles distinguish the CD69+IFNγ+, CD69+IFNγ-, and CD69-IFNγ- subsets, and whether the expansion of the total HLADR+CD38+ CD8 T cells or the IFNγ producing CD8 T cells differ depending on disease severity remained unclear. This study addresses these knowledge gaps. We find that the CD69+IFNγ+ subset uniquely expressed key genes involved in protein translation, cellular metabolism, proliferation and dendritic cell cross talk. Both the CD69+IFNγ+ and CD69+IFNγ- subsets had an antigen responsive gene signature with genes involved in cytotoxic effector functions, regulation of T cell receptor signaling, signaling by MAPK, chemotaxis and T cell trafficking to inflamed tissues with the expression being more robust in the IFNγ+ CD69+ subset. On the other hand, the CD69- IFNγ- subset was biased towards expression of genes that both augment and dampen T cell responses. Lastly, the expansion of total HLADR+ CD38+ CD8 T cells and also the IFNγ producing HLADR+ CD38+ CD8 T cells was similar in patients with different grades of disease. Taken together, this study provides valuable insights into the inherent diversity of the effector CD8 T cell response during dengue.

TI  - Transcriptional response of Wolbachia-transinfected Aedes aegypti mosquito cells to dengue virus at early stages of infection
JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 103
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are responsible for viral infections and represent a considerable public health burden. Aedes aegypti is the principal vector of dengue virus (DENV), therefore understanding the intrinsic virus–host interactions is vital, particularly in the presence of the endosymbiont Wolbachia, which blocks virus replication in mosquitoes. Here, we examined the transcriptional response of Wolbachia -transinfected Ae. aegypti Aag2 cells to DENV infection. We identified differentially expressed immune genes that play a key role in the activation of anti-viral defence such as the Toll and immune deficiency pathways. Further, genes encoding cytosine and N6-adenosine methyltransferases and SUMOylation, involved in post-transcriptional modifications, an antioxidant enzyme, and heat-shock response were up-regulated at the early stages of DENV infection and are reported here for the first time. Additionally, several long non-coding RNAs were among the differentially regulated genes. Our results provide insight into Wolbachia -transinfected Ae. aegypti’s initial virus recognition and transcriptional response to DENV infection.

TI  - Transcriptome Analysis of Responses to Dengue Virus 2 Infection in Aedes albopictus (Skuse) C6/36 Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), a member of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, can cause dengue fever (DF) and more serious diseases and thus imposes a heavy burden worldwide. As the main vector of DENV, mosquitoes are a serious hazard. After infection, they induce a complex host–pathogen interaction mechanism. Our goal is to further study the interaction mechanism of viruses in homologous, sensitive, and repeatable C6/36 cell vectors. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology was applied to the host transcript profiles of C6/36 cells infected with DENV2. Then, bioinformatics analysis was used to identify significant differentially expressed genes and the associated biological processes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to verify the sequencing data. A total of 1239 DEGs were found by transcriptional analysis of Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells that were infected and uninfected with dengue virus, among which 1133 were upregulated and 106 were downregulated. Further bioinformatics analysis showed that the upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in signaling pathways such as the MAPK, Hippo, FoxO, Wnt, mTOR, and Notch; metabolic pathways and cellular physiological processes such as autophagy, endocytosis, and apoptosis. Downregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in DNA replication, pyrimidine metabolism, and repair pathways, including BER, NER, and MMR. The qRT-PCR results showed that the concordance between the RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR data was very high (92.3%). The results of this study provide more information about DENV2 infection of C6/36 cells at the transcriptome level, laying a foundation for further research on mosquito vector–virus interactions. These data provide candidate antiviral genes that can be used for further functional verification in the future.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis of Aedes aegypti Aag2 cells in response to dengue virus-2 infection
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes that is prevalent in tropical and subtropical countries and has four serotypes (DENV1-4). Aedes aegypti, as the main transmission vector of DENV, exhibits strong infectivity and transmission. With the aim of obtaining a better understanding of the Ae. aegypti-DENV interaction, the transcriptome changes in DENV-2-infected Aag2 cells were studied to describe the immune responses of mosquitoes using the Ae. aegypti Aag2 cell line as a model. RNAseq technology was used to sequence the transcripts of the Ae. aegypti Aag2 cell line before and after infection with DENV-2. A bioinformatics analysis was then performed to assess the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes, and the sequencing data were verified by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The transcriptome analysis generated 8866 unigenes that were found in both groups, 225 unigenes that were only found in the infection group, and 683 unigenes that only existed in the control group. A total of 1199 differentially expressed genes, including 1014 upregulated and 185 downregulated genes, were identified. The bioinformatics analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in the longevity regulating pathway, circadian rhythm, DNA replication, and peroxisome, purine, pyrimidine, and drug metabolism. The qRT-PCR verification results showed the same trend, which confirmed that the expression of the differentially expressed genes had changed, and that the transcriptome sequencing data were reliable. This study investigated the changes in the transcriptome levels in the DENV-2-infected Ae. aegypti Aag2 cell line, which provides a faster and effective method for discovering genes related to Ae. aegypti pathogen susceptibility. The findings provide basic data and directions for further research on the complex mechanism underlying host-pathogen interactions.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis of Aedes albopictus midguts infected by dengue virus identifies a gene network module highly associated with temperature
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 15
AB  - Dengue is prevalent worldwide and is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Temperature is a strong driver of dengue transmission. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Aedes albopictus mosquitoes exposed or not exposed to dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) were reared at 23 °C, 28 °C and 32 °C, and midguts and residual tissues were evaluated at 7 days after infection. RNA sequencing of midgut pools from the control group, midgut breakthrough group and midgut nonbreakthrough group at different temperatures was performed. The transcriptomic profiles were analyzed using the R package, followed by weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis to identify the important molecular mechanisms regulated by temperature. The midgut infection rate and midgut breakthrough rate at 28 °C and 32 °C were significantly higher than those at 23 °C, which indicates that high temperature facilitates DENV-2 breakthrough in the Ae. albopictus midgut. Transcriptome sequencing was performed to investigate the antiviral mechanism in the midgut. The midgut gene expression datasets clustered with respect to temperature, blood-feeding and midgut breakthrough. Over 1500 differentially expressed genes were identified by pairwise comparisons of midguts at different temperatures. To assess key molecules regulated by temperature, we used WGCNA, which identified 28 modules of coexpressed genes; the ME3 module correlated with temperature. KEGG analysis indicated that RNA degradation, Toll and immunodeficiency factor signaling and other pathways are regulated by temperature. Temperature affects the infection and breakthrough of Ae. albopictus midguts invaded by DENV-2, and Ae. albopictus midgut transcriptomes change with temperature. The candidate genes and key pathways regulated by temperature provide targets for the prevention and control of dengue.

TI  - Transcriptome comparison of dengue-susceptible and -resistant field derived strains of Colombian Aedes aegypti using RNA-sequencing
JF  - Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz
VL  - 116
AB  - BACKGROUND Forty percent of the world’s population live in areas where they are at risk from dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. Dengue viruses are transmitted primarily by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. In Cali, Colombia, approximately 30% of field collected Ae. aegypti are naturally refractory to all four dengue serotypes. OBJECTIVES Use RNA-sequencing to identify those genes that determine refractoriness in feral mosquitoes to dengue. This information can be used in gene editing strategies to reduce dengue transmission. METHODS We employed a full factorial design, analyzing differential gene expression across time (24, 36 and 48 h post bloodmeal), feeding treatment (blood or blood + dengue-2) and strain (susceptible or refractory). Sequences were aligned to the reference Ae. aegypti genome for identification, assembled to visualize transcript structure, and analyzed for dynamic gene expression changes. A variety of clustering techniques was used to identify the differentially expressed genes. FINDINGS We identified a subset of genes that likely assist dengue entry and replication in susceptible mosquitoes and contribute to vector competence. MAIN CONCLUSIONS The differential expression of specific genes by refractory and susceptible mosquitoes could determine the phenotype, and may be used to in gene editing strategies to reduce dengue transmission.

TI  - Transcriptome of the Aedes aegypti Mosquito in Response to Human Complement Proteins
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 21
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the primary mosquito vector of several human arboviruses, including the dengue virus (DENV). Vector control is the principal intervention to decrease the transmission of these viruses. The characterization of molecules involved in the mosquito physiological responses to blood-feeding may help identify novel targets useful in designing effective control strategies. In this study, we evaluated the in vivo effect of feeding adult female mosquitoes with human red blood cells reconstituted with either heat-inactivated (IB) or normal plasma (NB). The RNA-seq based transcript expression of IB and NB mosquitoes was compared against sugar-fed (SF) mosquitoes. In in vitro experiments, we treated Aag2 cells with a recombinant version of complement proteins (hC3 or hC5a) and compared transcript expression to untreated control cells after 24 h. The transcript expression analysis revealed that human complement proteins modulate approximately 2300 transcripts involved in multiple biological functions, including immunity. We also found 161 upregulated and 168 downregulated transcripts differentially expressed when human complement protein C3 (hC3) and human complement protein C5a (hC5a) treated cells were compared to the control untreated cells. We conclude that active human complement induces significant changes to the transcriptome of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, which may influence the physiology of these arthropods.

TI  - Transcriptome profiles and novel lncRNA identification of Aedes aegypti cells in response to dengue virus serotype 1
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a single-stranded, positive-strand RNA virus that belongs to the family of Flaviviridae, and it is mainly transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti). Understanding the interaction of the virus with mosquito vector is vital for devising new strategies for preventing virus transmission. Although protein-coding genes have been the central focus, many reports indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were also involved in virus-host interaction. Recently, the latest version of Ae. aegypti genome (AaegL5) was released, and the assembly was up to chromosome level. This prompted us to perform lncRNA identification and characterization using the latest genome release as reference. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of both protein-coding and lncRNA genes in Aedes aegypti cells upon DENV infection. By combining RNA-seq libraries generated in this study with publicly available datasets, we identified a total of 7,221 novel lncRNA transcripts, of which 3,052 and 3,620 were intronic and intergenic respectively, while 549 were antisense to the reference genes. A total of 2,435 differentially expressed transcripts, of which 956 of them were lncRNAs. Overall, the distribution of lncRNA expression and fold change upon virus infection were lower than that of protein-coding genes. We found that the expression of immune-related genes involved in IMD and MAPK signaling pathways were altered. In addition, the expression of major genes involved in RNA-interference (RNAi) pathway that confers antiviral resistance in mosquitoes were found to be unchanged upon DENV infection. Gene ontology analysis suggests that differentially expressed transcripts, either upregulated or downregulated, generally belong to the same functional categories or working in similar signaling pathways. Taken together, besides providing a new set of lncRNA repertoire, the outcomes of our study offer better understanding of Ae. aegypti responses to DENV infection at gene level. Author Summary Dengue virus (DENV), a single-stranded and positive-strand RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae, is primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) mosquitoes. There are four closely related but antigenically different serotypes of dengue virus namely DENV1-4. Our understanding on the interaction of each serotype of DENV with its mosquito vector is still very limited. Since vector-borne viruses pose significant burden to public health, knowledge on the virus-host interaction at the molecular level is essential, especially in developing effective strategies to control virus transmission. In this study, we embarked on investigating the transcriptional response of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and protein-coding genes upon dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV1) infection. Besides, we also generate a comprehensive list of novel lncRNAs identified from the latest and improved genome version of Ae. aegypti. Similar to protein-coding genes, we discovered that the overall expression of lncRNA was significantly altered, suggesting that lncRNAs were involved in virus-host interaction. The results of this study provide basic understanding on the interaction between DENV1 and Ae. aegypti vector at the transcriptional level.

TI  - Transcriptome profiling reveals differential expression of interferon family induced by dengue virus 2 in human endothelial cells on tissue culture plastic and polyacrylamide hydrogel
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 88
AB  - A cell model is critical for studying the molecular mechanisms of dengue virus 2 (DENV‐2) invasions and cell bioactivity can be easily affected by the substrate matrix. Tissue culture plastic (TCP) and polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAMH) are two kinds of matrices widely used for cells. The effects of different matrices on the cultured cells with DENV‐2 invasion remain unknown. To address the issue, the effects of TCP and PAMH were explored in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with DENV‐2 invasion. HUVECs were assigned into four groups: group A (cultured on TCP), group B (cultured on PAMH), group C (cultured on TCP with DENV‐2 invasion), and group D (cultured on PAMH with DENV‐2 invasion). Flow cytometry was performed on HUVECs after 48‐hr culture. Gene expression patterns were analyzed by gene microarray. The levels of interleukin‐29 (IL‐29) were measured by real‐time qRT‐PCR and ELISA. There were no cell apoptosis induced by DENV‐2 in HUVECs cultured on TCP and PAMH (P > 0.05). After DENV‐2 invasion, the up‐regulated genes involve in the activities of oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), interferon‐related cytokine, and growth factors so on. The up‐regulated pathways involve in the responses to DENV‐2 and innate immunity. IL‐29 was induced in the HUVECs on PAMH when compared with the cells on TCP (P < 0.05). Thus, different matrices cause different immune responses, which should be considered in the cell models for exploring the molecular mechanisms of DENV‐induced diseases. J. Med.

TI  - Transcriptomic Profiling of Diverse Aedes aegypti Strains Reveals Increased Basal-level Immune Activation in Dengue Virus-refractory Populations and Identifies Novel Virus-vector Molecular Interactions
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 7
AB  - Genetic variation among Aedes aegypti populations can greatly influence their vector competence for human pathogens such as the dengue virus (DENV). While intra-species transcriptome differences remain relatively unstudied when compared to coding sequence polymorphisms, they also affect numerous aspects of mosquito biology. Comparative molecular profiling of mosquito strain transcriptomes can therefore provide valuable insight into the regulation of vector competence. We established a panel of A. aegypti strains with varying levels of susceptibility to DENV, comprising both laboratory-maintained strains and field-derived colonies collected from geographically distinct dengue-endemic regions spanning South America, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia. A comparative genome-wide gene expression microarray-based analysis revealed higher basal levels of numerous immunity-related gene transcripts in DENV-refractory mosquito strains than in susceptible strains, and RNA interference assays further showed different degrees of immune pathway contribution to refractoriness in different strains. By correlating transcript abundance patterns with DENV susceptibility across our panel, we also identified new candidate modulators of DENV infection in the mosquito, and we provide functional evidence for two potential DENV host factors and one potential restriction factor. Our comparative transcriptome dataset thus not only provides valuable information about immune gene regulation and usage in natural refractoriness of mosquito populations to dengue virus but also allows us to identify new molecular interactions between the virus and its mosquito vector.

TI  - Transcriptomic immune profiles of human flavivirus‐specific T‐cell responses
JF  - Immunology
VL  - 160
AB  - The Flavivirus genus of viruses includes dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), yellow fever (YFV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), and West Nile (WNV) viruses. Infections with these species combined are prevalent in tropical and sub‐tropical areas, affecting millions of people and ranging from asymptomatic to severe forms of the disease. They therefore pose a serious threat to global public health. Several studies imply a role for T cells in the protection but also pathogenesis against the different flavivirus species. Identifying flavivirus‐specific T‐cell immune profiles and determining how pre‐exposure of one species might affect the immune response against subsequent infections from other species is important to further define the role of T cells in the immune response against infection. Understanding the immune profiles of the flavivirus‐specific T‐cell response in natural infection is important to understand the T‐cell response in the context of vaccination. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on human immune profiles of flavivirus‐specific T‐cell reactivity, comparing natural infection with the acute form of the disease and vaccination in different flavivirus infections.

TI  - Transcriptomics of Acute DENV-Specific CD8+ T Cells Does Not Support Qualitative Differences as Drivers of Disease Severity
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 10
AB  - While several lines of evidence suggest a protective role of T cells against disease associated with Dengue virus (DENV) infection, their potential contribution to immunopathology in the acute phase of DENV infection remains controversial, and it has been hypothesized that the more severe form of the disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF) is associated with altered T cell responses. To address this question, we determined the transcriptomic profiles of DENV-specific CD8+ T cells in a cohort of 40 hospitalized dengue patients with either a milder form of the disease (dengue fever, DF) or a more severe disease form (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF). We found multiple transcriptomic signatures, one associated with DENV-specific interferon-gamma responding cells and two other gene signatures, one specifically associated with the acute phase and the other with the early convalescent phase. Additionally, we found no differences in quantity and quality of DENV-specific CD8+ T cells based on disease severity. Taken together with previous findings that did not detect altered DENV-specific CD4 T cell responses, the current analysis argues against alteration in DENV-specific T cell responses as being a correlate of immunopathology.

TI  - Transgenic Expression of Human C-Type Lectin Protein CLEC18A Reduces Dengue Virus Type 2 Infectivity in Aedes aegypti
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 12
AB  - The C-type lectins, one family of lectins featuring carbohydrate binding domains which participate in a variety of bioprocesses in both humans and mosquitoes, including immune response, are known to target DENV. A human C-type lectin protein CLEC18A in particular shows extensive glycan binding abilities and correlates with type-I interferon expression, making CLEC18A a potential player in innate immune responses to DENV infection; this potential may provide additional regulatory point in improving mosquito immunity. Here, we established for the first time a transgenic Aedes aegypti line that expresses human CLEC18A. This expression enhanced the Toll immune pathway responses to DENV infection. Furthermore, viral genome and virus titers were reduced by 70% in the midgut of transgenic mosquitoes. We found significant changes in the composition of the midgut microbiome in CLEC18A expressing mosquitoes, which may result from the Toll pathway enhancement and contribute to DENV inhibition. Transgenic mosquito lines offer a compelling option for studying DENV pathogenesis, and our analyses indicate that modifying the mosquito immune system via expression of a human immune gene can significantly reduce DENV infection.

TI  - Transient Blockade of Type I Interferon Signalling Promotes Replication of Dengue Virus Strain D2Y98P in Adult Wild-Type Mice
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 (DENV1–4) place nearly half the global population at risk of infection and the licenced tetravalent dengue vaccine fails to protect individuals who have not previously been exposed to DENV. The development of intervention strategies had long been hampered by the lack of a suitable small animal model. DENV does not replicate in wild-type mice due to its inability to antagonise the mouse type I interferon (IFN) response. Mice deficient in type I IFN signalling (Ifnar1−/− mice) are highly susceptible to DENV infection, but their immunocompromised status makes it difficult to interpret immune responses elicited by experimental vaccines. To develop an alternative mouse model for vaccine testing, we treated adult wild-type mice with MAR1-5A3—an IFNAR1-blocking, non-cell-depleting antibody—prior to infection with the DENV2 strain D2Y98P. This approach would allow for vaccination of immunocompetent mice and subsequent inhibition of type I IFN signalling prior to challenge infection. While Ifnar1−/− mice quickly succumbed to infection, MAR1-5A3-treated mice did not show any signs of illness but eventually seroconverted. Infectious virus was recovered from the sera and visceral organs of Ifnar1−/− mice, but not from those of mice treated with MAR1-5A3. However, high levels of viral RNA were detected in the samples of MAR1-5A3-treated mice, indicating productive viral replication and dissemination. This transiently immunocompromised mouse model of DENV2 infection will aid the pre-clinical assessment of next-generation vaccines as well as novel antiviral treatments.

TI  - Translation elongation factor-1alpha, La, and PTB interact with the 3' untranslated region of dengue 4 virus RNA.
JF  - Virology
VL  - 295 2
SP  - 337
EP  - 47
AB  - The 384-nt long 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of dengue 4 virus (DEN4) is not polyadenylated, but contains the adjacent thermodynamically stable conserved short and long stem-loop structures (L-SL) and the conserved sequences CS1 and CS2. The latter are duplicated (CS2A and CS2B) in DEN4. Dengue virus replication, like that of other RNA viruses, might involve the cis-elements located within the 3'UTR and the trans-acting factors that could interact with the viral replicase to function as a replicase complex. The identification and characterization of viral and cellular proteins involved in the interaction with the 3'UTR of dengue virus will help us to understand the cellular requirements for viral replication. To determine these requirements, mobility shift and cross-linking assays were performed with uninfected and DEN4-infected C6/36 cell extracts as well as the different segments of the 3'UTR. Our results revealed that RNA-protein complexes were formed with the RNAs which involved the domains CS2A, CS2B, CS1, and L-SL. The minimum RNA sequence that was able to form specific and stable complexes with cellular proteins was the CS1-L-SL region. Using UV-induced cross-linking we identified eight proteins with molecular weights of 34, 39, 51, 52, 56, 62, 72, and 84 kDa that bound to the complete 3'UTR. The translation elongation factor-1alpha (EF-1alpha) bound to the complete 3'UTR and to the CS1-L-SL region. In addition, the recombinant GST-human La autoantigen bound to the 3'UTR and to the CS1-L-SL region as demonstrated by mobility shift and cross-linking assays. Although different antibodies against PTB were unable to react with any of the cellular proteins from C6/36, the recombinant His-PTB protein did bind to the complete 3'UTR and to the CS1-L-SL region. The specific binding of La and PTB to the sequences considered essential for viral RNA replication may suggest that these proteins could function as RNA chaperones to maintain RNA structure in a conformation that favors viral replication, while EF-1alpha may function as an RNA helicase.

JF  - The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene
VL  - 81 5
SP  - 817
EP  - 24
AB  - The role of the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of the dengue virus (DENV) genome during viral translation remains to be elucidated. We assessed the contribution of well-defined RNA elements in the 3'UTR of DENV-2 to viral translation using a virus-induced reporting gene system and deoxyribozymes (DRzs) targeting the 3'UTR of the DENV-2 genome. Results show that mRNAs carrying a deletion of repeated conserved sequence (RCS2)-CS2 are translated less efficiently than wild type mRNAs. However, mRNAs with a deletion of CS1-stem loop (SL) are translated more efficiently. Thus, CS1-SL and RCS2-CS2 may have different effects on translational regulation. Additionally, the translation-suppressing effect of CS1-SL or the SL element is further confirmed in DENV-2-infected cells using DRzs. Mutagenesis studies show that, rather than the secondary structure, nucleotides 10663-10677 and 10709-10723 are responsible for translational suppression of SL. Overall, our results demonstrate that sequences and elements within the DENV-2 3'UTR regulate viral translation.

TI  - Transovarial Infection of Dengue Virus in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus
JF  - Jurnal Kesehatan Masyarakat
AB  - Nowadays, Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) is still a significant health problem. Including in Kupang City. The existence of transovarial infection of Dengue virus is essential to know to support the prevention to be more effective and efficient. This study aimed to determine the existence of transovarial infectious and the serotypes variability of Dengue virus in Aedes sp in Kupang City. This observational research took place in nine villages in Kupang City in 2017. Where 20 houses in each village are observed to collect Aedes sp eggs. Cluster sampling was conducted to choose houses with DHF cases and surrounding areas 100 m from the cases. Ovitrap and Ovistrip were used to collect Aedes sp eggs, then Aedes sp eggs are reared in Parasitology Laboratory UGM. Adults mosquitoes from rearing were observed the transovarial Infection and Dengue Virus Serotype by One Step RT-PCR followed by nested PCR. This research found a transovarial infection in Aedes aegypti  and Aedes albopictus   and for Denvir-2 and Denvir-3. This finding is a change from previous findings in the same place where only Denvir-1 was transmitted transovarially in Aedes sp.

AB  - Transovarial transmission of all four dengue serotypes was demonstrated in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The rates of such transmission varied with the serotype and strain of virus. In general, the highest rates were observed with strains of dengue type 1 and the lowest with dengue type 3. Surprisingly, despite the use of viral strains of the four dengue serotypes which gave the highest rates with Ae. albopictus, transovarial transmission was observed in Aedes aegypti only with dengue type 1, and then only at a relatively low rate. Five different strains of Ae. aegypti were employed, including one that was known to be relatively susceptible to oral infection with dengue viruses. The findings support the view that Ae. aegypti, while of major importance from the point of view of transmission of dengue to man, may be relatively unimportant in the overall natural history of dengue viruses.

TI  - Triggering of DC migration by dengue virus stimulation of COX‐2‐dependent signaling cascades in vitro highlights the significance of these cascades beyond inflammation
JF  - European Journal of Immunology
VL  - 39
AB  - A term “bone‐breaking fever” is used in Chinese medicine to describe the symptoms of patients infected with dengue virus (DV). We examined the significance of the COX‐prostaglandin pathway in human DC infected by DV. We show that DV infection induced the expression of COX‐2 and the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in DC, and stimulated the DNA binding of NF‐κB and the kinase activity of both IκBα kinase (IKK) α and β. DV infection also activated MAPK and AP‐1 signaling. Both IκBα kinase‐NF‐κB and MAPK‐AP‐1 were upstream of COX‐2 activation. Our investigation into the significance of COX‐2‐PGE2 pathway also revealed that DV infection enhances DC migration by inducing CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) expression, and that blocking COX‐2 or MAPK activity suppresses DV‐induced DC migration. Our data also suggest that PGE2 can induce CCR7 expression on DC and that antagonists of the PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4 suppress DV‐induced DC migration. We further show that the increased CCR7 expression was observed in both DV‐infected and bystander DC, suggesting the presence of secondary effects in inducing CCR7 expression. Collectively, this study reveals not only the pathways involved in COX‐2 synthesis in DV‐infected DC but also the autocrine action of PGE2 on the migration of DV‐infected DC.

TI  - Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulation of cells with established dengue virus type 2 infection induces cell death that is accompanied by a reduced ability of TNF-alpha to activate nuclear factor kappaB and reduced sphingosine kinase-1 activity.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 92 Pt 4
SP  - 807
EP  - 18
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) has an antiviral role in some infections but in dengue virus (DENV) infection it is linked to severe pathology. We have previously shown that TNF-α stimulation cannot activate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) to the fullest extent in DENV-2-infected cells. Here, we investigate further responses of DENV-2-infected cells to TNF-α, focussing particularly on cell death and pro-survival signals. TNF-α stimulation of productively DENV-2-infected monocyte-derived macrophages or HEK-293 cells induced caspase-3-mediated cell death. While TNF-α induced comparable degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB alpha (IκB-α) and NF-κB activation in mock-infected and DENV-2-infected cells early in infection, later in infection and coinciding with TNF-α-induced cell death, TNF-α-stimulated IκB-α degradation and NF-κB activation was reduced. This was associated with reduced levels of sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) activity in DENV-2-infected cells; SphK1 being a known mediator of TNF-α-stimulated survival signals. Transfection experiments demonstrated inhibition of TNF-α-stimulated NF-κB activation by expression of DENV-2 capsid (CA) but enhancement by DENV-2 NS5 protein. DENV-2 CA alone, however, did not induce TNF-α-stimulated cell death or inhibit SphK1 activity. Thus, productively DENV-2-infected cells have compromised TNF-α-stimulated survival pathways and show enhanced susceptibility to TNF-α-stimulated cell death, suggesting a role for TNF-α in the killing of healthy productively DENV-2-infected cells. Additionally, the altered ability of TNF-α to activate NF-κB as infection progresses is reflected by the opposing actions of DENV-2 CA and NS5 proteins on TNF-α-stimulated NF-κB activation and could have important consequences for NF-κB-driven release of inflammatory cytokines.

TI  - Two Distinct Sets of NS2A Molecules Are Responsible for Dengue Virus RNA Synthesis and Virion Assembly
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 1298
EP  - 1313
AB  - ABSTRACT Flavivirus nonstructural protein 2A (NS2A) plays important roles in both viral RNA synthesis and virion assembly. The molecular details of how the NS2A protein modulates the two distinct events have not been defined. To address this question, we have performed a systematic mutagenesis of NS2A using dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 (DENV-2) as a model. We identified two sets of NS2A mutations with distinct defects during a viral infection cycle. One set of NS2A mutations (D125A and G200A) selectively abolished viral RNA synthesis. Mechanistically, the D125A mutation abolished viral RNA synthesis through blocking the N-terminal cleavage of the NS2A protein, leading to an unprocessed NS1-NS2A protein; this result suggests that amino acid D125 (far downstream of the N terminus of NS2A) may contribute to the recognition of host protease at the NS1-NS2A junction. The other set of NS2A mutations (G11A, E20A, E100A, Q187A, and K188A) specifically impaired virion assembly without significantly affecting viral RNA synthesis. Remarkably, mutants defective in virion assembly could be rescued by supplying in trans wild-type NS2A molecules expressed from a replicative replicon, by wild-type NS2A protein expressed alone, by a mutant NS2A (G200A) that is lethal for viral RNA synthesis, or by a different mutant NS2A that is defective in virion assembly. In contrast, none of the mutants defective in viral RNA synthesis could be rescued by trans-complementation. Collectively, the results indicate that two distinct sets of NS2A molecules are responsible for DENV RNA synthesis and virion assembly. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) represents the most prevalent mosquito-borne human pathogen. Understanding the replication of DENV is essential for development of vaccines and therapeutics. Here we characterized the function of DENV-2 NS2A using a systematic mutagenesis approach. The mutagenesis results revealed two distinct sets of NS2A mutations: one set of mutations that result in defects in viral RNA synthesis and another set of mutations that result in defects in virion assembly. trans-Complementation analysis showed that mutants defective in viral RNA synthesis could not be rescued by wild-type NS2A; in contrast, mutants defective in virion assembly could be successfully rescued by wild-type NS2A or even by a mutant NS2A that is incompetent to support viral RNA synthesis. These results support a model in which two distinct sets of NS2A molecules are responsible for DENV RNA synthesis (located in the viral replication complex) and virion assembly (located in the virion assembly/budding site). The study confirms and extends our understanding of the two critical roles of flavivirus NS2A in viral RNA synthesis and virion assembly.

TI  - Type I IFNs and IL-18 Regulate the Antiviral Response of Primary Human γδ T Cells against Dendritic Cells Infected with Dengue Virus
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 194
SP  - 3890
EP  - 3900
AB  - Little is known about the cellular mechanisms of innate immunity against dengue virus (DV) infection. Specifically, the γδ T cell response to DV has not been characterized in detail. In this article, we demonstrate that markers of activation, proliferation, and degranulation are upregulated on γδ T cells in PBMC isolated from individuals with acute dengue fever. Primary γδ T cells responded rapidly in vitro to autologous DV-infected dendritic cells by secreting IFN-γ and upregulating CD107a. The anti-DV IFN-γ response is regulated by type I IFN and IL-18 in a TCR-independent manner, and IFN-γ secreting γδ T cells predominantly expressed IL-18Rα. Antagonizing the ATP-dependent P2X7 receptor pathway of inflammasome activation significantly inhibited the anti-DV IFN-γ response of γδ T cells. Overnight priming with IL-18 produced effector γδ T cells with significantly increased ability to lyse autologous DV-infected dendritic cells. Monocytes were identified as accessory cells that augmented the anti-DV IFN-γ response of γδ T cells. Lack of monocytes in culture is associated with lower IL-18 levels in culture supernatant and diminished production of IFN-γ by γδ T cells, whereas addition of exogenous IL-18 restored the IFN-γ response of γδ T cells in monocyte-depleted cocultures with DV-infected DC. Our results indicate that primary γδ T cells contribute to the immune response during DV infection by providing an early source of IFN-γ, as well as by killing DV-infected cells, and suggest that monocytes participate as accessory cells that sense DV infection and amplify the cellular immune response against this virus in an IL-18–dependent manner.

TI  - T‐cells producing multiple combinations of IFNγ, TNF and IL10 are associated with mild forms of dengue infection
JF  - Immunology
VL  - 160
AB  - Multifunctional interleukin 10 (IL10)+Th1 cells have been implicated in favorable evolution of many infectious diseases, promoting an efficacious immune response while limiting immunopathology. Here, we investigated the presence of multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T‐cells that expressed interferon gamma (IFNγ), IL10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or its combinations during dengue infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from outpatients with dengue (mild dengue forms) and hospitalized patients (or patients with dengue with warning signs and severe dengue) were cultured in the presence of envelope (ENV) or NS3 peptide libraries of DENV during critical (hospitalization period) and convalescence phases. The production of IFNγ, IL10 and TNF by CD4+ and CD8+ T‐cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Our data show that patients with mild dengue, when compared with patients with dengue with warning signs and severe dengue, presented higher frequencies of multifunctional T‐cells like NS3‐specific IFNγ/IL10‐producing CD4+ T‐cells in critical phase and NS3‐ and ENV‐specific CD8+ T‐cells producing IFNγ/IL10. In addition, NS3‐specific CD8+ T‐cells producing high levels of IFNγ/TNF and IFNγ/TNF/IL10 were also observed in the mild dengue group. We observed that multifunctional T‐cells produced higher levels of cytokines as measured by intracellular content when compared with single producer T‐cells. Importantly, multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T‐cells producing IFNγ, TNF and IL10 simultaneously displayed positive correlation with platelet levels, suggesting a protective role of this population. The presence of IL10+Th1 and IL10+Tc1 multifunctional cells was associated with mild dengue presentation, suggesting that these cells play a role in clinical evolution of dengue infection.

TI  - USP18 Mediates Interferon Resistance of Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Previous studies demonstrated that dengue virus (DENV) infection developed resistance to type-I interferons (IFNα/β). The underlying mechanism remains unclear. USP18 is a negative regulator of IFNα/β signaling, and its expression level is significantly increased following DENV infection in cell lines and patients’ blood. Our previous study revealed that increased USP18 expression contributed to the IFN-α resistance of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). However, the role of USP18 in DENV replication and resistance to IFN-α is elusive. In this current study, we aimed to explore the role of USP18 in DENV-2 replication and resistance to IFN-α. The level of USP18 was up-regulated by plasmid transfection and down-regulated by siRNA transfection in Hela cells. USP18, IFN-α, IFN-β expression, and DENV-2 replication were monitored by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The activation of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway was assessed at three levels: p-STAT1/p-STAT2 (Western blot), interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) activity (Dual-luciferase assay), and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression (qRT-PCR). Our data showed that DENV-2 infection increased USP18 expression in Hela cells. USP18 overexpression promoted DENV-2 replication, while USP18 silence inhibited DENV-2 replication. Silence of USP18 potentiated the anti-DENV-2 activity of IFN-α through activation of the IFN-α-mediated Jak/STAT signaling pathway as shown by increased expression of p-STAT1/p-STAT2, enhanced ISRE activity, and elevated expression of some ISGs. Our data indicated that USP18 induced by DENV-2 infection is a critical host factor utilized by DENV-2 to confer antagonism on IFN-α.

TI  - USP18 enhances dengue virus replication by regulating mitochondrial DNA release
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection remains a challenging health threat worldwide. Ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18), which preserves the anti-interferon (IFN) effect, is an ideal target through which DENV mediates its own immune evasion. However, much of the function and mechanism of USP18 in regulating DENV replication remains incompletely understood. In addition, whether USP18 regulates DENV replication merely by causing IFN hyporesponsiveness is not clear. In the present study, by using several different approaches to block IFN signaling, including IFN neutralizing antibodies (Abs), anti-IFN receptor Abs, Janus kinase inhibitors and IFN alpha and beta receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1)knockout cells, we showed that USP18 may regulate DENV replication in IFN-associated and IFN-unassociated manners. Localized in mitochondria, USP18 regulated the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the cytosol to affect viral replication, and mechanisms such as mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, mobilization of calcium into mitochondria, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) expression, oxidation and fragmentation of mtDNA, and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) were involved in USP18-regulated mtDNA release to the cytosol. We therefore identify mitochondrial machineries that are regulated by USP18 to affect DENV replication and its association with IFN effects.

TI  - Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2J1 negatively modulates interferon pathway and promotes RNA virus infection
JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 15
AB  - Viral infection activates innate immune pathways and interferons (IFNs) play a pivotal role in the outcome of a viral infection. Ubiquitin modifications of host and viral proteins significantly influence the progress of virus infection. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2s (UBE2) have the capacity to determine ubiquitin chain topology and emerge as key mediators of chain assembly. In this study, we screened the functions of 34 E2 genes using an RNAi library during Dengue virus (DENV) infection. RNAi and gene overexpression approaches were used to study the gene function in viral infection and interferon signaling. We found that silencing UBE2J1 significantly impaired DENV infection, while overexpression of UBE2J1 enhanced DENV infection. Further studies suggested that type I IFN expression was significantly increased in UBE2J1 silenced cells and decreased in UBE2J1 overexpressed cells. Reporter assay suggested that overexpression of UBE2J1 dramatically suppressed RIG-I directed IFNβ promoter activation. Finally, we have confirmed that UBE2J1 can facilitate the ubiquitination and degradation of transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). These results suggest that UBE2 family member UBE2J1 can negatively regulate type I IFN expression, thereby promote RNA virus infection.

JF  - Journal of Virology

EP  - 4697
AB  - ABSTRACT During dengue virus infection of host cells, intracellular membranes are rearranged into distinct subcellular structures such as double-membrane vesicles, convoluted membranes, and tubular structures. Recent electron tomographic studies have provided a detailed three-dimensional architecture of the double-membrane vesicles, representing the sites of dengue virus replication, but temporal and spatial evidence linking membrane morphogenesis with viral RNA synthesis is lacking. Integrating techniques in electron tomography and molecular virology, we defined an early period in virus-infected mosquito cells during which the formation of a virus-modified membrane structure, the double-membrane vesicle, is proportional to the rate of viral RNA synthesis. Convoluted membranes were absent in dengue virus-infected C6/36 cells. Electron tomographic reconstructions elucidated a high-resolution view of the replication complexes inside vesicles and allowed us to identify distinct pathways of particle formation. Hence, our findings extend the structural details of dengue virus replication within mosquito cells and highlight their differences from mammalian cells. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus induces several distinct intracellular membrane structures within the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells. These structures, including double-membrane vesicles and convoluted membranes, are linked, respectively, with viral replication and viral protein processing. However, dengue virus cycles between two disparate animal groups with differing physiologies: mammals and mosquitoes. Using techniques in electron microscopy, we examined the differences between intracellular structures induced by dengue virus in mosquito cells. Additionally, we utilized techniques in molecular virology to temporally link events in virus replication to the formation of these dengue virus-induced membrane structures.

JF  - Infection and Immunity
VL  - 20
SP  - 173
EP  - 179
AB  - Ultrastructural studies of dengue-2 virus-infected lymphoblastoid Raji cells showed that the virus induced an increase in the size of the rough endoplasmic reticula (RER) and that the replication of the virus was confined to the cisternae of these RER. The proliferating RER formed cytoplasmic inclusions that could be seen by light microscopy. This observation could be used as evidence of a cytopathogenic effect of dengue virus on infected Rajii cells in routine cultures. Accumulation of virions in the infected cells was minimal in comparison with other cell systems, however. Sporadic clusters of mature virions were often seen on the plasma membrane. These extracellular virions were distributed adjacent to the virus-bearing RER and were presumably released virions. Vertical transmission of the virus was evident in mitotic lymphoblasts. The replication pattern of dengue virus in lymphoblastoid cells suggests that efforts should be made to determine whether blast-transformed lymphocytes, numerous in secondary dengue infections, support dengue virus replication in vivo.

AB  - BackgroundEarly interaction of dengue virus and monocyte/macrophages could be an important feature for virus dissemination after its initial entry via the mosquito vector. Since ultrastructural analysis of this interaction has not been reported, dengue type 2 (DEN2) virus-infected human monocyte cultures were studied at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after infection.ResultsTypical dengue particles and fuzzy coated viral particles were 35 to 42 nm and 74 to 85 nm respectively. Viruses were engulfed by phagocytosis and macropicnocytosis leading to huge vacuoles and phagosomes inside the monocytes. Interaction of monocytes with DEN2 virus induced apoptosis, characterized by nuclear condensation and fragmentation, cellular shrinkage, blebbing and budding phenomena and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by neighboring monocytes. This finding was confirmed by TUNEL. Ultrastructural features associated to DEN2 virus replication were not observed.ConclusionThese data suggest that clearance of the virus by monocytes and cellular death are the main features during the initial interaction of DEN2 virus and monocytes and this could be important in the rapid elimination of the virus after infection by mosquito vector.

TI  - Uncoupling cis-Acting RNA Elements from Coding Sequences Revealed a Requirement of the N-Terminal Region of Dengue Virus Capsid Protein in Virus Particle Formation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86

EP  - 1058
AB  - ABSTRACT Little is known about the mechanism of flavivirus genome encapsidation. Here, functional elements of the dengue virus (DENV) capsid (C) protein were investigated. Study of the N-terminal region of DENV C has been limited by the presence of overlapping cis-acting RNA elements within the protein-coding region. To dissociate these two functions, we used a recombinant DENV RNA with a duplication of essential RNA structures outside the C coding sequence. By the use of this system, the highly conserved amino acids FNML, which are encoded in the RNA cyclization sequence 5′CS, were found to be dispensable for C function. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal 18 amino acids of C impaired DENV particle formation. Two clusters of basic residues (R5-K6-K7-R9 and K17-R18-R20-R22) were identified as important. A systematic mutational analysis indicated that a high density of positive charges, rather than particular residues at specific positions, was necessary. Furthermore, a differential requirement of N-terminal sequences of C for viral particle assembly was observed in mosquito and human cells. While no viral particles were observed in human cells with a virus lacking the first 18 residues of C, DENV propagation was detected in mosquito cells, although to a level about 50-fold less than that observed for a wild-type (WT) virus. We conclude that basic residues at the N terminus of C are necessary for efficient particle formation in mosquito cells but that they are crucial for propagation in human cells. This is the first report demonstrating that the N terminus of C plays a role in DENV particle formation. In addition, our results suggest that this function of C is differentially modulated in different host cells.

TI  - Uncovering Flavivirus Host Dependency Factors through a Genome-Wide Gain-of-Function Screen
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - Flaviviruses, such as dengue (DENV), West Nile (WNV), yellow fever (YFV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, are mosquito-borne pathogens that present a major risk to global public health. To identify host factors that promote flavivirus replication, we performed a genome-wide gain-of-function cDNA screen for human genes that enhance the replication of flavivirus reporter particles in human cells. The screen recovered seventeen potential host proteins that promote viral replication, including the previously known dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase non-catalytic subunit (DDOST). Using silencing approaches, we validated the role of four candidates in YFV and WNV replication: ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19), ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), DDOST and importin 9 (IPO9). Applying a panel of virological, biochemical and microscopic methods, we validated further the role of RPL19 and DDOST as host factors required for optimal replication of YFV, WNV and ZIKV. The genome-wide gain-of-function screen is thus a valid approach to advance our understanding of flavivirus replication.

TI  - Under-the-Radar Dengue Virus Infections in Natural Populations of Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes
JF  - mSphere
VL  - 5
AB  - Since 1999, dengue outbreaks in the continental United States involving local transmission have occurred only episodically and only in Florida and Texas. In Florida, these episodes appear to be coincident with increased introductions of dengue virus into the region through human travel and migration from countries where the disease is endemic. To date, the U.S. public health response to dengue outbreaks has been largely reactive, and implementation of comprehensive arbovirus surveillance in advance of predictable transmission seasons, which would enable proactive preventative efforts, remains unsupported. The significance of our finding is that it is the first documented report of DENV4 transmission to and maintenance within a local mosquito vector population in the continental United States in the absence of a human case during two consecutive years. Our data suggest that molecular surveillance of mosquito populations in high-risk, high-tourism areas of the United States may enable proactive, targeted vector control before potential arbovirus outbreaks. ABSTRACT The incidence of locally acquired dengue infections increased during the last decade in the United States, compelling a sustained research effort concerning the dengue mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, and its microbiome, which has been shown to influence virus transmission success. We examined the “metavirome” of four populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected in 2016 to 2017 in Manatee County, FL. Unexpectedly, we discovered that dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV4) was circulating in these mosquito populations, representing the first documented case of such a phenomenon in the absence of a local DENV4 human case in this county over a 2-year period. We confirmed that all of the mosquito populations carried the same DENV4 strain, assembled its full genome, validated infection orthogonally by reverse transcriptase PCR, traced the virus origin, estimated the time period of its introduction to the Caribbean region, and explored the viral genetic signatures and mosquito-specific virome associations that potentially mediated DENV4 persistence in mosquitoes. We discuss the significance of prolonged maintenance of the DENV4 infections in A. aegypti that occurred in the absence of a DENV4 human index case in Manatee County with respect to the inability of current surveillance paradigms to detect mosquito vector infections prior to a potential local outbreak. IMPORTANCE Since 1999, dengue outbreaks in the continental United States involving local transmission have occurred only episodically and only in Florida and Texas.

TI  - Understanding Flavivirus Capsid Protein Functions: The Tip of the Iceberg
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 9
AB  - Flaviviruses are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA arboviruses, infectious to humans and many other animals and are transmitted primarily via tick or mosquito vectors. Capsid is the primary structural protein to interact with viral genome within virus particles and is therefore necessary for efficient packaging. However, in cells, capsid interacts with many proteins and nucleic acids and we are only beginning to understand the broad range of functions of flaviviral capsids. It is known that capsid dimers interact with the membrane of lipid droplets, aiding in both viral packaging and storage of capsid prior to packaging. However, capsid dimers can bind a range of nucleic acid templates in vitro, and likely interact with a range of targets during the flavivirus lifecycle. Capsid may interact with host RNAs, resulting in altered RNA splicing and RNA transcription. Capsid may also bind short interfering-RNAs and has been proposed to sequester these species to protect flaviviruses from the invertebrate siRNA pathways. Capsid can also be found in the nucleolus, where it wreaks havoc on ribosome biogenesis. Here we review flavivirus capsid structure, nucleic acid interactions and how these give rise to multiple functions. We also discuss how these features might be exploited either in the design of effective antivirals or novel vaccine strategies.

JF  - ACS chemical biology
VL  - 10 2
SP  - 517
EP  - 26
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection affects millions of people and is becoming a major global disease for which there is no specific available treatment. pep14-23 is a recently designed peptide, based on a conserved segment of DENV capsid (C) protein. It inhibits the interaction of DENV C with host intracellular lipid droplets (LDs), which is crucial for viral replication. Combining bioinformatics and biophysics, here, we analyzed pep14-23 structure and ability to bind different phospholipids, relating that information with the full-length DENV C. We show that pep14-23 acquires α-helical conformation upon binding to negatively charged phospholipid membranes, displaying an asymmetric charge distribution structural arrangement. Structure prediction for the N-terminal segment reveals four viable homodimer orientations that alternatively shield or expose the DENV C hydrophobic pocket. Taken together, these findings suggest a new biological role for the disordered N-terminal region, which may function as an autoinhibitory domain mediating DENV C interaction with its biological targets. The results fit with our current understanding of DENV C and pep14-23 structure and function, paving the way for similar approaches to understanding disordered proteins and improved peptidomimetics drug development strategies against DENV and similar Flavivirus infections.

JF  - Immunological Reviews
VL  - 225
AB  - Summary: Dengue viruses (DENV) are the mosquito‐borne viruses of greatest global public health importance. DENV circulate as four serotypes with significant immunologic cross‐reactivity that does not provide protection from secondary infection with heterologous serotypes. The strong association of severe dengue illness, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), with heterologous secondary infection and high cytokine levels has led to a prevailing view that DHF is immunologically mediated. In vitro studies of DENV‐specific T lymphocytes, clinical studies of acute DENV infection, and immunologic studies in mouse models have provided evidence that in heterologous secondary DENV infection, there is preferential activation of memory T lymphocytes with lower avidity for the infecting virus (‘original antigenic sin’) resulting in altered T‐cell functional responses. In the setting of host genetic predisposition and high level viremia, with resulting high antigenic burden, we postulate that a skewed T‐cell cytokine response leads to plasma leakage in DHF. A better understanding of the immune responses associated with increased or decreased risk for DHF will be of immense value for the clinical studies of candidate multivalent DENV vaccines anticipated to take place in the next several years.

TI  - Understanding the role of microRNAs in the interaction of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with an insect-specific flavivirus.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 98 7
SP  - 1892
EP  - 1903
AB  - The Flavivirus genus contains some of the most prevalent vector-borne viruses, such as the dengue, Zika and yellow fever viruses that cause devastating diseases in humans. However, the insect-specific clade of flaviviruses is restricted to mosquito hosts, albeit they have retained the general features of the genus, such as genome structure and replication. The interactions between insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) and their mosquito hosts are largely unknown. Pathogenic flaviviruses are known to modulate host-derived microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs that are important in controlling gene expression. Alterations in miRNAs may represent changes in host gene expression and promote understanding of virus-host interactions. The role of miRNAs in ISF-mosquito interactions is largely unknown. A recently discovered Australian ISF, Palm Creek virus (PCV), has the ability to suppress medically relevant flaviviruses. Here, we investigated the potential involvement of miRNAs in PCV infection using the model mosquito Aedes aegypti. By combining small-RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, differentially expressed miRNAs were determined. Our results indicated that PCV infection hardly affects host miRNAs. Out of 101 reported miRNAs of Ae. aegypti, only aae-miR-2940-5p had a significantly altered expression over the course of infection. However, further analysis of aae-miR-2940-5p revealed that this miRNA does not have any direct impact on PCV replication in vitro. Thus, overall the results suggest that PCV infection has a limited effect on the mosquito miRNA profile and therefore miRNAs may not play a significant role in the PCV-Ae. aegypti interaction.

JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 15
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika represent a major burden on global public health. To fight against these arboviruses, vector control strategies are a priority. One existing strategy is based on the use of an endosymbiotic bacterium, Wolbachia, which reduces the transmission of arboviruses by the mosquito Aedes aegypti via a pathogen blocking effect. Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti disrupts several pathways of the host’s metabolism. Trehalose is a carbohydrate circulating mainly in insect hemolymph and plays a role in numerous mechanisms as energy source or stress recovery molecule and in chitin synthesis. This study explores the importance of trehalose in the interactions between Wolbachia and Ae. aegypti, and attempts to understand the pathogen blocking effect.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes dengue, which is a very common mosquito-borne viral disease. The global incidence of dengue has increased dramatically in recent decades. About half of the world's population is now at risk. This virus is widespread throughout the tropics, which are influenced by rainfall, temperature, and humidity; however, severe dengue has a higher risk of death when not managed timely. To describe Dengue virus helicase ATP binding domain (HABD) protein in biochemically characterized. Sequences analysis, structure modeling, secondary structure prediction, ATPase assay, unwinding assay, RNA binding assay. HABD has RNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activity which are crucial proteins that participate in the unwinding of double-stranded DNA or RNA by utilizing ATP. RNA binding proteins and DEAD-box RNA helicases have been revealed to contribute to viral replication. Moreover, DEAD-box RNA helicases have been demonstrated to be involved in several features of cellular metabolism of RNA, for example, transcription, splicing, biogenesis, ribosomal processing of RNA, etc. In the present study, we have mainly focused on the Dengue virus's helicase ATP binding domain (HABD) and observed that HABD contains RNA-dependent ATPase and unwinding activity at different concentrations and time points.

AB  - Dengue virus hijacks host cell mechanisms and immune responses in order to replicate efficiently. The interaction between the host and the virus affects the host's gene expression, which remains largely unexplored. This pilot study aimed to profile the host transcriptome as a potential strategy for identifying specific biomarkers for dengue prediction and detection. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was employed to generate host transcriptome profiles in 16 dengue patients and 10 healthy controls. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in patients with severe dengue and those with dengue with warning signs compared to healthy individuals. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to elucidate the functions of upregulated and downregulated genes. Compared to healthy controls, 6466 genes were significantly differentially expressed (p < 0.05) in the dengue with warning signs group and 3082 genes in the severe dengue group, with over half being upregulated. The major KEGG pathways implicated included transport and catabolism (14.4%–16.3%), signal transduction (6.6%–7.3%), global and overview maps (6.7%–7.1%), viral diseases (4.6%–4.8%), and the immune system (4.4%–4.6%). Several genes exhibited consistent and significant upregulation across all dengue patients, regardless of severity: Interferon alpha inducible protein 27 (IFI27), Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain Containing 14 (KCTD14), Syndecan 1 (SDC1), DCC netrin 1 receptor (DCC), Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), Marginal zone B and B1 cell-specific protein (MZB1), Nestin (NES), C–C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), TNF receptor superfamily member 17 (TNFSF17), and TNF receptor superfamily member 13B (TNFRSF13B). Further analysis revealed potential biomarkers for severe dengue prediction, including TNF superfamily member 15 (TNFSF15), Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-2 (SERPINB2), motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7), aconitate decarboxylase 1 (ACOD1), Metallothionein 1G (MT1G), and Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MYLK2), which were expressed 3.5 times, 2.9 times, 2.3 times, 2.1 times, 1.7 times, and 1.4 times greater, respectively, than dengue patients exhibiting warning signs. The identification of these host biomarkers through RNA-sequencing holds promising implications and potential to augment existing dengue detection algorithms, contributing significantly to improved diagnostic and prognostic capabilities.

TI  - Unravelling tRNA fragments in DENV pathogenesis: Insights from RNA sequencing
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 14
AB  - Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) derived from tRNAs are known as tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). These tsRNAs are further categorized into tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) and tRNA halves (tiRNAs), which play significant roles in the various molecular mechanisms underlying certain human diseases. However, the generation of tsRNAs and their potential roles during Dengue virus (DENV) infection is not yet known. Here, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify the generation and alterations in tsRNAs expression profiles of DENV-infected Huh7 cells. Upon DENV infection, tRNA fragmentation was found to be increased. We identified a significant number of differentially expressed tsRNAs during DENV infection. Interestingly, the 3′tRF population showed upregulation, while the i-tRF population exhibited downregulation. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was performed to analyze the impact of differentially expressed tsRNAs on DENV pathogenesis. Our results suggest that differentially expressed tsRNAs are involved in transcriptional regulation via RNA polymerase II promoter and metabolic pathways. Overall, our study contributes significantly to our understanding of the roles played by tsRNAs in the complex dynamics of DENV infection.

TI  - Unstructural biology of the dengue virus proteins
JF  - The FEBS Journal
VL  - 282
AB  - In this study, we used a wide spectrum of bioinformatics techniques to evaluate the extent of intrinsic disorder in the complete proteomes of genotypes of four human dengue virus (DENV), to analyze the peculiarities of disorder distribution within individual DENV proteins, and to establish potential roles for the structural disorder with respect to their functions. We show that several proteins (ER, E, 1, 2A and 4A) are predicted to be mostly ordered, whereas four proteins (C, 2k, NS3 and NS5) are expected to have high disorder levels. The profiles of disorder propensities are similar across the four genotypes, except for the NS5 protein. Cleavage sites are depleted in polymorphic sites, and have a high propensity for disorder, especially relative to neighboring residues. Disordered regions are highly polymorphic in type 1 DENV but have a relatively low number of polymorphic sites in the type 4 virus. There is a high density of polymorphisms in proteins 2A and 4A, which are depleted in disorder. Thus, a high density of polymorphism is not unique to disordered regions. Analysis of disorder/function association showed that the predominant function of the disordered regions in the DENV proteins is protein–protein interaction and binding of nucleic acids, metals and other small molecules. These regions are also associated with phosphorylation, which may regulate their function.

TI  - Unusual Reversible Oligomerization of Unfolded Dengue Envelope Protein Domain 3 at High Temperatures and Its Abolition by a Point Mutation.
JF  - Biochemistry
VL  - 55 32
SP  - 4469
EP  - 75
AB  - We report differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments between 10 and 120 °C of Dengue 4 envelope protein domain 3 (DEN4 ED3), a small 107-residue monomeric globular protein domain. The thermal unfolding of DEN4 ED3 was fully reversible and exhibited two peculiar endothermic peaks. AUC (analytical ultracentrifugation) experiments at 25 °C indicated that DEN4 ED3 was monomeric. Detailed thermodynamic analysis indicated that the two endothermic peaks separated with an increasing protein concentration, and global fitting of the DSC curves strongly suggested the presence of unfolded tetramers at temperatures around 80-90 °C, which dissociated to unfolded monomers at even higher temperatures. To further characterize this rare thermal unfolding process, we designed and constructed a DEN4 ED3 variant that would unfold according to a two-state model, typical of globular proteins. We thus substituted Val 380, the most buried residue at the dimeric interface in the protein crystal, with less hydrophobic amino acids (Ala, Ser, Thr, Asn, and Lys). All variants showed a single heat absorption peak, typical of small globular proteins. In particular, the DSC thermogram of DEN4 V380K indicated a two-state reversible thermal unfolding independent of protein concentration, indicating that the high-temperature oligomeric state was successfully abolished by a single mutation. These observations confirmed the standard view that small monomeric globular proteins undergo a two-state unfolding. However, the reversible formation of unfolded oligomers at high temperatures is a truly new phenomenon, which was fully inhibited by an accurately designed single mutation.

JF  - Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine
VL  - 19
SP  - 1065
EP  - 1076
AB  - Galectin‐9 (Gal‐9) exerts immunosuppressive effects by inducing apoptosis in T cells that produce interferon‐γ and interleukin (IL)‐17. However, Gal‐9 can be pro‐inflammatory in lipopolysaccharide‐stimulated monocytes. Using microarray analysis, we observed that Gal‐9 was up‐regulated in human dendritic cells (DCs) after dengue virus (DV) infection. The investigation into the immunomodulatory effects and mechanisms of Gal‐9 in DCs exposed to DV revealed that DV infection specifically increased mRNA and protein levels of Gal‐9 but not those of Gal‐1 or Gal‐3. Blocking p38, but not c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase or extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK), inhibited DV‐induced expression of Gal‐9. Reduction in Gal‐9 by small interference RNA treatment suppressed DV‐stimulated migration of DCs towards the chemoattractants CCL19 and CCL21. In addition, DV‐induced IL‐12p40 production was reduced after knockdown of Gal‐9 in DCs. Furthermore, Gal‐9 deficiency suppressed DV‐induced activation of nuclear factor‐κB. Inhibition of DV‐induced DC migration under conditions of Gal‐9 deficiency was mediated through suppressing ERK activation but not by regulating the expression of CCR7, the receptor for CCL19 and CCL21. Both the reduction in IL‐12 production and the suppression of ERK activity might account for the inhibition of DV‐induced DC migration after knockdown of Gal‐9. In summary, this study reveals the roles of Gal‐9 in DV‐induced migration of DCs. The findings indicate that Gal‐9 might be a therapeutic target for preventing immunopathogenesis induced by DV infection.

Virus Res. 163(1), 238–245 (2011). Unlike many other viruses that downregulate MHC class I expression on infected cell membranes, flaviviruses were reported to upregulate the MHC class I expression. Dengue virus was shown to induce HLA class I expression; however, the precise transcriptional mechanism that is used by the virus remains unclear. This article assessed the findings of a recently published report describing the mechanism used by dengue virus to induce HLA-A2 expression and characterizing the transcription factors that are involved. The study showed that p50/p65 and p65/65 NF-κB dimers bind to the class I regulatory complex within the HLA-A2 promoter. This finding and its significance for the design of possible antiviral therapeutic agents are discussed in this article.

AB  - INTRODUCTION
Dengue is an important mosquito-borne disease in tropical and subtropical regions. Adhesion molecules have not been systematically characterized in the renal tissue of patients with severe dengue (SD). The objective of this study was to detect viral antigens in samples from patients that evolved with SD, correlating with the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, VE-cadherin, and E-selectin to contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of SD.


METHODS
Kidney specimens from patients with SD were selected according to clinical and laboratorial data and submitted to histological and immunohistochemistry analysis. A semiquantitative evaluation was performed considering positive immunostaining in 20 glomeruli.


RESULTS
Viral antigens were mainly detected in distal tubules. The intense immunostaining of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 was observed. The expression of E-selectin was discrete, and VE-cadherin expression varied from mild to moderate. VCAM-1 was slightly intense in the glomerular capsule; the expression of ICAM-1 was diffuse. E-selectin was diffuse, and VE-cadherin varied from mild to moderate. The most frequent histological findings were glomerular congestion, mild glomerulitis, acute renal injury, and glomerular atrophy.


CONCLUSIONS
The results appear to demonstrate an imbalance between vascular endothelial permeability regulating events in renal lesions in SD. The increase in the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 is an in-situ indicator of higher permeability with a consequent influx of cells favoring the inflammation of the endothelium. These molecules are important in the pathophysiology of the disease and provide the possibility of developing new markers for the evaluation, clinical follow-up, and therapeutic response of patients with SD.

AB  - To clarify whether the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) are associated with denguevirus (DENV) evasion of the antiviral response, we analyzed the expression kinetics of SOCS1 and SOCS3 and of the antiviral genes MxA and OAS during DENV infection of U937 macrophages that were or not treated with interferon (IFN)-α. DENV infection produced a viral titer three times higher in untreated than in IFN-α-treated cells (p < 0.001 at 72 h postinfection [p.i.]). Partial inhibition of DENV replication was associated with reduced expression of MxA and OAS antiviral genes as well as higher SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression in DENV-infected cells than in cells treated only with IFN-α. Complete loss of phosphorylated-signal transducer and activator of transcription (p-STAT)2 and reduced nuclear importation of p-STAT1 were observed in DENV-infected cells compared to IFN-α treatment that induced p-STAT1 and p-STAT2. Our data thus suggest that overexpression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 induced by DENV infection leads to impairment of antiviral response through the inhibition of STAT functionality.

VL  - 95
AB  - Recent field trials have demonstrated that dengue incidence can be substantially reduced by introgressing strains of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia into Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. This strategy relies on Wolbachia reducing the susceptibility of Ae. aegypti to disseminated infection by positive-sense RNA viruses like dengue. ABSTRACT Recent field trials have demonstrated that dengue incidence can be substantially reduced by introgressing strains of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia into Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. This strategy relies on Wolbachia reducing the susceptibility of Ae. aegypti to disseminated infection by positive-sense RNA viruses like dengue. However, RNA viruses are well known to adapt to antiviral pressures. Here, we review the viral infection stages where selection for Wolbachia-resistant virus variants could occur. We also consider the genetic constraints imposed on viruses that alternate between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, and the likely selection pressures to which dengue virus might adapt in order to be effectively transmitted by Ae. aegypti that carry Wolbachia. While there are hurdles to dengue viruses developing resistance to Wolbachia, we suggest that long-term surveillance for resistant viruses should be an integral component of Wolbachia-introgression biocontrol programs.

TI  - Using genetic variation in Aedes aegypti to identify candidate anti-dengue virus genes
JF  - BMC Infectious Diseases
VL  - 19
AB  - BackgroundTranscriptomic profiling has generated extensive lists of genes that respond to viral infection in mosquitoes. These gene lists contain two types of genes; (1) those that are responsible for the insect’s natural antiviral defense mechanisms, including some known innate immunity genes, and (2) genes whose change in expression may occur simply as a result of infection. As genetic modification tools for mosquitoes continue to improve, the opportunities to make refractory insects via allelic replacement or delivery of small RNAs that alter gene expression are expanding. Therefore, the ability to identify which genes in transcriptional profiles may have immune function has increasing value. Arboviruses encounter a range of mosquito tissues and physiologies as they traverse from the midgut to the salivary glands. While the midgut is well-studied as the primary tissue barrier, antiviral genes expressed in the subsequent tissues of the carcass offer additional candidates for second stage intervention in the mosquito body.MethodsMosquito lines collected recently from field populations exhibit natural genetic variation for dengue virus susceptibility. We sought to use a modified full-sib breeding design to identify mosquito families that varied in their dengue viral load in their bodies post infection.ResultsBy delivering virus intrathoracically, we bypassed the midgut and focused on whole body responses in order to evaluate carcass-associated refractoriness. We tested 25 candidate genes selected for their appearance in multiple published transcriptional profiles and were able to identify 12 whose expression varied with susceptibility in the genetic families.ConclusionsThis method, using natural genetic variation, offers a simple means to screen and reduce candidate gene lists prior to carrying out more labor-intensive functional studies. The extracted RNA from the females across the families represents a storable resource that can be used to screen subsequent candidate genes in the future. The aspect of vector competence being assessed could be varied by focusing on different tissues or time points post infection.

TI  - VEGF Upregulation in Viral Infections and Its Possible Therapeutic Implications
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 19
AB  - Several viruses are recognized as the direct or indirect causative agents of human tumors and other severe human diseases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is identified as a principal proangiogenic factor that enhances the production of new blood vessels from existing vascular network. Therefore, oncogenic viruses such as Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and non-oncogenic viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and dengue virus, which lack their own angiogenic factors, rely on the recruitment of cellular genes for angiogenesis in tumor progression or disease pathogenesis. This review summarizes how human viruses exploit the cellular signaling machinery to upregulate the expression of VEGF and benefit from its physiological functions for their own pathogenesis. Understanding the interplay between viruses and VEGF upregulation will pave the way to design targeted and effective therapeutic approaches for viral oncogenesis and severe diseases.

JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 87
AB  - Vascular permeability determines the severity of dengue virus infection. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its (receptor 1) R1 and (receptor 2) R2 receptors may provide insight about the neurological complications of dengue. We report VEGF and its R1 and R2 receptors level in dengue patients and correlate these with neurological complications. Consecutive patients with dengue were subjected to clinical and neurological evaluations. Their blood counts, serum chemistry, including liver and kidney function tests, serum creatine kinase (CK), and albumin were measured. VEGF, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 were measured by ELISA in the patients and 16 matched controls. Twenty four patients with dengue were included whose ages ranged between 15 and 67 years, and nine of whom were females. Serum VEGF level was insignificantly lower in dengue patients whereas VEGFR1 was significantly higher (P = 0.01) and VEGFR2 was significantly lower (P = 0.005) compared to controls. VEGFR2 correlated with systolic blood pressure, coagulopathy, and serum CK levels. None of the other clinical and biochemical parameters correlated with VEGF and VEGFR1 levels. VEGFR1 and R2 normalized at 1 month. VEGFR2 correlates with the clinical severity of dengue and muscle dysfunction. J. Med. Virol. 87:1449–1455, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Variable Surface Epitopes in the Crystal Structure of Dengue Virus Type 3 Envelope Glycoprotein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 1223
EP  - 1231
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus is an emerging global health threat. The major envelope glycoprotein, E, mediates viral attachment and entry by membrane fusion. Antibodies that bind but fail to neutralize noncognate serotypes enhance infection. We have determined the crystal structure of a soluble fragment of the envelope glycoprotein E from dengue virus type 3. The structure closely resembles those of E proteins from dengue type 2 and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Serotype-specific neutralization escape mutants in dengue virus E proteins are all located on a surface of domain III, which has been implicated in receptor binding. While antibodies against epitopes in domain I are nonneutralizing in dengue virus, there are neutralizing antibodies that recognize serotype-conserved epitopes in domain II. The mechanism of neutralization for these antibodies is probably inhibition of membrane fusion. Our structure shows that neighboring glycans on the viral surface are spaced widely enough (at least 32 Å) that they can interact with multiple carbohydrate recognition domains on oligomeric lectins such as DC-SIGN, ensuring maximum affinity for these putative receptors.

TI  - Vascular Leakage in Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Is Associated with Dengue Infected Monocytes, Monocyte Activation/Exhaustion, and Cytokines Production
JF  - International Journal of Vascular Medicine
VL  - 2015
AB  - The vascular leakage was shown by the increment of hematocrit (Hct), dengue viral infected monocyte, monocyte status, and cytokines production in patients infected with dengue virus. Dengue viral antigens were demonstrated in monocytes (CD14+) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The increased levels of Hct, interleukin- (IL-) 10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were detected in dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) patients as compared with other febrile illnesses (OFIs). The highest levels of Hct and IL-10 were detected in DSS patients as compared with other groups (P < 0.05) especially on one day before and after defervescence. The unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated monocytes from DSS patients showed the significantly decreased of intracellular IL-1β and TNF-α. In addition, the lowest level of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD11b expression on monocytes surface in DSS patients was also demonstrated. Furthermore, the negative correlations between IL-10 levels and intracellular IL-1β and MFI of CD11b expression in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated monocytes were also detected. Nevertheless, not only were the relationships between the prominent IL-10 and the suppression of intracellular monocyte secretion, namely, IL-1β, TNF-α, demonstrated but also the effect of vascular leakage was observed.

JF  - Fems Immunology and Medical Microbiology
VL  - 53

EP  - 299
AB  - Abstract Increased vascular permeability without morphological damage to the capillary endothelium is the cardinal feature of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Extensive plasma leakage in various tissue spaces and serous cavities of the body, including the pleural, pericardial and peritoneal cavities in patients with DHF, may result in profound shock. Among various mechanisms that have been considered include immune complex disease, T‐cell‐mediated, antibodies cross‐reacting with vascular endothelium, enhancing antibodies, complement and its products, various soluble mediators including cytokines, selection of virulent strains and virus virulence, but the most favoured are enhancing antibodies and memory T cells in a secondary infection resulting in cytokine tsunami. Whatever the mechanism, it ultimately targets vascular endothelium (making it a battlefield) leading to severe dengue disease. Extensive recent work has been done in vitro on endothelial cell monolayer models to understand the pathophysiology of vascular endothelium during dengue virus (DV) infection that may be translated to help understand the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS. The present review provides a broad overview of the effects of DV infection and the associated host responses contributing towards alterations in vascular endothelial cell physiology and damage that may be responsible for the DHF/DSS.

JF  - Cell and Tissue Research
VL  - 355
SP  - 621
EP  - 633
AB  - Viral hemorrhagic diseases are a group of systemic viral infections with worldwide distribution and are significant causes of global mortality and morbidity. The hallmarks of viral hemorrhagic fevers are plasma leakage, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy and hemorrhagic manifestations. The molecular mechanisms leading to plasma leakage in viral hemorrhagic fevers are not well understood. A common theme has emerged in which a complex interplay between pathogens, host immune response, and endothelial cells leads to the activation of endothelial cells and perturbation of barrier integrity. In this article, two clinically distinct viral hemorrhagic fevers caused by dengue viruses and hantaviruses are discussed to highlight their similarities and differences that may provide insights into the pathogenesis and therapeutic approach.

TI  - Vascular leakage in severe dengue virus infections: a potential role for the nonstructural viral protein NS1 and complement.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
VL  - 193 8
SP  - 1078
EP  - 88
AB  - BACKGROUND
Vascular leakage and shock are the major causes of death in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Thirty years ago, complement activation was proposed to be a key underlying event, but the cause of complement activation has remained unknown.


METHODS
The major nonstructural dengue virus (DV) protein NS1 was tested for its capacity to activate human complement in its membrane-associated and soluble forms. Plasma samples from 163 patients with DV infection and from 19 patients with other febrile illnesses were prospectively analyzed for viral load and for levels of NS1 and complement-activation products. Blood and pleural fluids from 9 patients with DSS were also analyzed.


RESULTS
Soluble NS1 activated complement to completion, and activation was enhanced by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against NS1. Complement was also activated by cell-associated NS1 in the presence of specific antibodies. Plasma levels of NS1 and terminal SC5b-9 complexes correlated with disease severity. Large amounts of NS1, complement anaphylatoxin C5a, and the terminal complement complex SC5b-9 were present in pleural fluids from patients with DSS.


CONCLUSIONS
Complement activation mediated by NS1 leads to local and systemic generation of anaphylatoxins and SC5b-9, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of the vascular leakage that occurs in patients with DHF/DSS.

TI  - Vav proteins do not influence dengue virus replication but are associated with induction of phospho-ERK, IL-6, and viperin mRNA following DENV infection in vitro
JF  - Microbiology Spectrum
VL  - 12
AB  - ABSTRACT Vav proteins are guanine exchange factors that activate Rac1/RhoA signaling to regulate many biological processes including inflammatory responses. Here, the expression and functional significance of Vav’s were investigated during dengue virus (DENV) infection. In primary monocyte-derived macrophages, Vav1, −2, and −3 mRNA levels demonstrate variable responses to DENV infection and correlate with DENV-induced host inflammatory (IL-6 and TNF-α), antiviral (viperin), or cell adhesion [intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1)] mRNA induction. Strong positive correlations were seen in particular for Vav2 with TNF-α and Vav3 with IL-6 mRNA. In the retinal pigmented epithelial cell line, ARPE-19, Vav2 was the main Vav expressed and was not affected by DENV infection. Heterologous Vav1 expression in ARPE-19 cells induced an increase in basal IL-6 mRNA but did not enhance DENV-induced mRNA responses. DENV RNA and DENV-induced viperin and IL-6 mRNA responses were also unaffected by Vav2 siRNA knockdown. Treatment of DENV-infected ARPE-19 cells with EHop-016 to block Vav signaling did not affect DENV RNA levels but increased DENV-mediated induction of IL-6 mRNA. More detailed assessment of DENV-induced responses to azathioprine, a clinically used immunosuppressant that can also block Vav signaling and act as a nucleoside analog, similarly demonstrated no change in DENV RNA levels but resulted in inhibition of DENV-induced phospho-ERK and increased DENV-induced-IL-6 and viperin mRNA in ARPE-19 cells. Thus, levels of Vav are associated with DENV-induced inflammatory responses, and blocking Vav signaling pathways does not compromise control of viral replication but may influence DENV-induced host responses. IMPORTANCE Dengue disease is characterized by an inflammatory-mediated immunopathology, with elevated levels of circulating factors including TNF-α and IL-6. If the damaging inflammatory pathways could be blocked without loss of antiviral responses or exacerbating viral replication, then this would be of potential therapeutic benefit. The study here has investigated the Vav guanine exchange factors as a potential alternative signaling pathway that may drive dengue virus (DENV)-induced inflammatory responses, with a focus on Vav1 and 2. While Vav proteins were positively associated with mRNA for inflammatory cytokines, blocking Vav signaling didn’t affect DENV replication but prevented DENV-induction of p-ERK and enhanced IL-6 (inflammatory) and viperin (antiviral) mRNA. These initial data suggest that Vav proteins could be a target that does not compromise control of viral replication and should be investigated further for broader impact on host inflammatory responses, in settings such as antibody-dependent enhancement of infection and in different cell types.

TI  - Vectorial Capacity of Aedes aegypti for Dengue Virus Type 2 Is Reduced with Co-infection of Metarhizium anisopliae
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 7
AB  - Background Aedes aegypti, is the major dengue vector and a worldwide public health threat combated basically by chemical insecticides. In this study, the vectorial competence of Ae. aegypti co-infected with a mildly virulent Metarhizium anisopliae and fed with blood infected with the DENV-2 virus, was examined. Methodology/Principal Findings The study encompassed three bioassays (B). In B1 the median lethal time (LT50) of Ae. aegypti exposed to M. anisopliae was determined in four treatments: co-infected (CI), single-fungus infection (SF), single-virus infection (SV) and control (C). In B2, the mortality and viral infection rate in midgut and in head were registered in fifty females of CI and in SV. In B3, the same treatments as in B1 but with females separated individually were tested to evaluate the effect on fecundity and gonotrophic cycle length. Survival in CI and SF females was 70% shorter than the one of those in SV and control. Overall viral infection rate in CI and SV were 76 and 84% but the mortality at day six post-infection was 78% (54% infected) and 6% respectively. Survivors with virus in head at day seven post-infection were 12 and 64% in both CI and SV mosquitoes. Fecundity and gonotrophic cycle length were reduced in 52 and 40% in CI compared to the ones in control. Conclusion/Significance Fungus-induced mortality for the CI group was 78%. Of the survivors, 12% (6/50) could potentially transmit DENV-2, as opposed to 64% (32/50) of the SV group, meaning a 5-fold reduction in the number of infective mosquitoes. This is the first report on a fungus that reduces the vectorial capacity of Ae. aegypti infected with the DENV-2 virus.

TI  - Very-long-chain fatty acid metabolic capacity of 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 12 (HSD17B12) promotes replication of hepatitis C virus and related flaviviruses
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 10
AB  - Flaviviridae infections represent a major global health burden. By deciphering mechanistic aspects of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-host interactions, one could discover common strategy for inhibiting the replication of related flaviviruses. By elucidating the HCV interactome, we identified the 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 12 (HSD17B12) as a human hub of the very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) synthesis pathway and core interactor. Here we show that HSD17B12 knockdown (KD) impairs HCV replication and reduces virion production. Mechanistically, depletion of HSD17B12 induces alterations in VLCFA-containing lipid species and a drastic reduction of lipid droplets (LDs) that play a critical role in virus assembly. Oleic acid supplementation rescues viral RNA replication and production of infectious particles in HSD17B12 depleted cells, supporting a specific role of VLCFA in HCV life cycle. Furthermore, the small-molecule HSD17B12 inhibitor, INH-12, significantly reduces replication and infectious particle production of HCV as well as dengue virus and Zika virus revealing a conserved requirement across Flaviviridae virus family. Overall, the data provide a strong rationale for the advanced evaluation of HSD17B12 inhibition as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral strategy for the treatment of Flaviviridae infections.

TI  - Vimentin Inhibits Dengue Virus Type 2 Invasion of the Blood-Brain Barrier
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes dengue fever, which is prevalent in the tropical and subtropical regions, and in recent years, has resulted in several major epidemics. Vimentin, a cytoskeletal component involved in DENV infection, is significantly reorganized during infection. However, the mechanism underlying the association between DENV infection and vimentin is still poorly understood. We generated vimentin-knockout (Vim-KO) human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and a Vim-KO SV129 suckling mouse model, combining the dynamic vimentin changes observed in vitro and differences in disease course in vivo, to clarify the role of vimentin in DENV-2 infection. We found that the phosphorylation and solubility of vimentin changed dynamically during DENV-2 infection of HBMECs, suggesting the regulation of vimentin by DENV-2 infection. The similar trends observed in the phosphorylation and solubility of vimentin showed that these characteristics are related. Compared with that in control cells, the DENV-2 viral load was significantly increased in Vim-KO HBMECs, and after DENV-2 infection, Vim-KO SV129 mice displayed more severe disease signs than wild-type SV129 mice, as well as higher viral loads in their serum and brain tissue, demonstrating that vimentin can inhibit DENV-2 infection. Moreover, Vim-KO SV129 mice had more disordered cerebral cortical nerve cells, confirming that Vim-KO mice were more susceptible to DENV-2 infection, which causes severe brain damage. The findings of our study help clarify the mechanism by which vimentin inhibits DENV-2 infection and provides guidance for antiviral treatment strategies for DENV infections.

TI  - Vimentin as a Multifaceted Player and Potential Therapeutic Target in Viral Infections
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 21
AB  - Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein that plays key roles in integration of cytoskeletal functions, and therefore in basic cellular processes such as cell division and migration. Consequently, vimentin has complex implications in pathophysiology. Vimentin is required for a proper immune response, but it can also act as an autoantigen in autoimmune diseases or as a damage signal. Although vimentin is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, it can also appear at extracellular locations, either in a secreted form or at the surface of numerous cell types, often in relation to cell activation, inflammation, injury or senescence. Cell surface targeting of vimentin appears to associate with the occurrence of certain posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and/or oxidative damage. At the cell surface, vimentin can act as a receptor for bacterial and viral pathogens. Indeed, vimentin has been shown to play important roles in virus attachment and entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), dengue and encephalitis viruses, among others. Moreover, the presence of vimentin in specific virus-targeted cells and its induction by proinflammatory cytokines and tissue damage contribute to its implication in viral infection. Here, we recapitulate some of the pathophysiological implications of vimentin, including the involvement of cell surface vimentin in interaction with pathogens, with a special focus on its role as a cellular receptor or co-receptor for viruses. In addition, we provide a perspective on approaches to target vimentin, including antibodies or chemical agents that could modulate these interactions to potentially interfere with viral pathogenesis, which could be useful when multi-target antiviral strategies are needed.

JF  - Molecular bioSystems
VL  - 6 5
SP  - 795
EP  - 806
AB  - Our previous study using expression proteomics demonstrated that many proteins, particularly five forms of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), were up-regulated in human endothelial cells upon dengue virus infection. To address functional significance of these proteins in response to dengue virus infection, we performed a functional proteomics study to identify hnRNPs-interacting proteins in the infected EA.hy926 cells. Immunoprecipitation followed by 2-D PAGE and mass spectrometric analyses revealed 18 and 13 interacting partners of hnRNP C1/C2 and hnRNP K, respectively. Interestingly, vimentin was a common partner for both hnRNP C1/C2 and K. The interaction between vimentin and these hnRNPs was confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis and also by double immunofluorescence staining. Disruption of vimentin intermediate filament by acrylamide not only dissociated these complexes but also reduced nuclear hnRNPs expression, whereas cytosolic hnRNPs expression was unchanged. We also demonstrated that vimentin was strongly associated with dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1). Disruption of vimentin intermediate filament not only dissociated this complex but also reduced dengue NS1 expression, as well as viral replication and release. Our data report for the first time that vimentin interacts with hnRNPs and dengue NS1, and plays a crucial role in replication and release of dengue virus.

TI  - Viperin Is Induced following Dengue Virus Type-2 (DENV-2) Infection and Has Anti-viral Actions Requiring the C-terminal End of Viperin
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 7
AB  - The host protein viperin is an interferon stimulated gene (ISG) that is up-regulated during a number of viral infections. In this study we have shown that dengue virus type-2 (DENV-2) infection significantly induced viperin, co-incident with production of viral RNA and via a mechanism requiring retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). Viperin did not inhibit DENV-2 entry but DENV-2 RNA and infectious virus release was inhibited in viperin expressing cells. Conversely, DENV-2 replicated to higher tires earlier in viperin shRNA expressing cells. The anti-DENV effect of viperin was mediated by residues within the C-terminal 17 amino acids of viperin and did not require the N-terminal residues, including the helix domain, leucine zipper and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) motifs known to be involved in viperin intracellular membrane association. Viperin showed co-localisation with lipid droplet markers, and was co-localised and interacted with DENV-2 capsid (CA), NS3 and viral RNA. The ability of viperin to interact with DENV-2 NS3 was associated with its anti-viral activity, while co-localisation of viperin with lipid droplets was not. Thus, DENV-2 infection induces viperin which has anti-viral properties residing in the C-terminal region of the protein that act to restrict early DENV-2 RNA production/accumulation, potentially via interaction of viperin with DENV-2 NS3 and replication complexes. These anti-DENV-2 actions of viperin show both contrasts and similarities with other described anti-viral mechanisms of viperin action and highlight the diverse nature of this unique anti-viral host protein.

TI  - Viral Evasion of the Complement System and Its Importance for Vaccines and Therapeutics
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 11
AB  - The complement system is a key component of innate immunity which readily responds to invading microorganisms. Activation of the complement system typically occurs via three main pathways and can induce various antimicrobial effects, including: neutralization of pathogens, regulation of inflammatory responses, promotion of chemotaxis, and enhancement of the adaptive immune response. These can be vital host responses to protect against acute, chronic, and recurrent viral infections. Consequently, many viruses (including dengue virus, West Nile virus and Nipah virus) have evolved mechanisms for evasion or dysregulation of the complement system to enhance viral infectivity and even exacerbate disease symptoms. The complement system has multifaceted roles in both innate and adaptive immunity, with both intracellular and extracellular functions, that can be relevant to all stages of viral infection. A better understanding of this virus-host interplay and its contribution to pathogenesis has previously led to: the identification of genetic factors which influence viral infection and disease outcome, the development of novel antivirals, and the production of safer, more effective vaccines. This review will discuss the antiviral effects of the complement system against numerous viruses, the mechanisms employed by these viruses to then evade or manipulate this system, and how these interactions have informed vaccine/therapeutic development. Where relevant, conflicting findings and current research gaps are highlighted to aid future developments in virology and immunology, with potential applications to the current COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Viral RNA switch mediates the dynamic control of flavivirus replicase recruitment by genome cyclization
JF  - eLife
VL  - 5
AB  - Viral replicase recruitment and long-range RNA interactions are essential for RNA virus replication, yet the mechanism of their interplay remains elusive. Flaviviruses include numerous important human pathogens, e.g., dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Here, we revealed a highly conserved, conformation-tunable cis-acting element named 5′-UAR-flanking stem (UFS) in the flavivirus genomic 5′ terminus. We demonstrated that the UFS was critical for efficient NS5 recruitment and viral RNA synthesis in different flaviviruses. Interestingly, stabilization of the DENV UFS impaired both genome cyclization and vRNA replication. Moreover, the UFS unwound in response to genome cyclization, leading to the decreased affinity of NS5 for the viral 5′ end. Thus, we propose that the UFS is switched by genome cyclization to regulate dynamic RdRp binding for vRNA replication. This study demonstrates that the UFS enables communication between flavivirus genome cyclization and RdRp recruitment, highlighting the presence of switch-like mechanisms among RNA viruses.

TI  - Viral interactions with host factors (TIM-1, TAM -receptors, Glut-1) are related to the disruption of glucose and ascorbate transport and homeostasis, causing the haemorrhagic manifestations of viral haemorrhagic fevers.
JF  - F1000Research
VL  - 12
AB  - The haemorrhagic features of viral haemorrhagic fevers may be caused by common patterns of metabolic disturbances of the glucose and ascorbate homeostasis. Haemorrhages and vasculature disfunctions are a clinical feature not only of viral haemorrhagic fevers, but also in scurvy, diabetes and thrombotic microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. Interestingly, the expression of glucose and ascorbate transporter Glut-1 on the erythrocyte membrane is associated with the inability to synthesize ascorbate and is restricted to that very species that are susceptible to filoviruses (primates, humans and fruit bats). Glut-1 may play a pivotal role in haemorrhagic fever pathogenesis. TIM-1 and TAM receptors have been recognized to enhance entry of Ebola, Lassa and Dengue viruses and viral interferences with TIM-1 could disturb its function, disturbing the expression of Glut-1. In those species not able to synthesize ascorbate and expressing Glut-1 on erythrocytes virus could interact with Glut-1 or other functionally related protein, and the influx of glucose into the cells would be severely impaired. As a consequence, transient hyperglycemia and a marked oxidative stress coupled with the high levels of glucose in plasma would be established, and then promote the activation of NF–κB transcription, exacerbating a pro-inflammatory response mediated by cytokines and chemokines: The inability to synthesize ascorbate is an Achilles Heel when trying to counteract the oxidative stress.

AB  - Arboviruses have been a huge threat for human health since the discovery of yellow fever virus in 1901. Arboviruses are arthropod born viruses, mainly transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks, responsible for more than thousands of deaths annually. The Flavivirideae family is probably the most clinically relevant, as it is composed of very important agents, such as dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and, recently, Zika virus. Intriguingly, despite their structural and genomic similarities, flaviviruses may cause conditions ranging from mild infections with fever, cutaneous rash, and headache, to very severe cases, such as hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, Guillain‐Barré syndrome, and microcephaly. These differences may greatly rely on viral burden, tissue tropism, and mechanisms of immune evasion that may depend on both viral and host genetic factors. Unfortunately, very little is known about the biology of these factors, and how they orchestrate these differences. In this context, viral structural proteins and host cellular receptors may have a great relevance, as their interaction dictates not only viral tissue tropism, but also a plethora on intracellular mechanisms that may greatly account for either failure or success of infection. A great number of viral receptors have been described so far, although there is still a huge gap in understanding their overall role during infection. Here we discuss some important aspects triggered after the interaction of flaviviruses and host membrane receptors, and how they change the overall outcome of the infection.

TI  - Viral replication and paracrine effects result in distinct, functional responses of dendritic cells following infection with dengue 2 virus
JF  - Journal of Leukocyte Biology
VL  - 84
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), a re‐emerging arbovirus, readily infects dendritic cells (DC) in culture and in vivo. However, there have been contradictory reports regarding the effect of DENV infection on DC activation and maturation. DC undergo a series of functional changes following exposure to infectious agents, including cytokine production and costimulatory and MHC molecule induction, culminating in stimulation of adaptive immune responses. Immunological memory to primary DENV infection critically influences disease severity during subsequent infections with heterologous serotypes. To explore these phenomena, we examined DENV infection‐dependent and ‐independent effects on DC secretory, phenotypic, and allostimulatory functions. DENV infection of DC resulted in the secretion of a broad array of cytokines and chemokines. Type I IFN produced by DC inhibited propagation of infection and induced the chemokine IFN‐γ‐inducible protein 10 (IP‐10; CXCL10). Based on intracellular cytokine staining, infected DC produced less IP‐10 but more TNF‐α than uninfected bystander cells in the same culture. DENV exposure activated surface molecule expression on infected and bystander cells; infected DC had enhanced programmed death ligand 2 (PD‐L2) and MHC II expression but reduced levels of PD‐L1, CD80, CD86, and MHC I relative to bystander DC. Dengue‐infected DC cultures stimulated resting allogeneic CD4 T cell proliferation, although an increasing multiplicity of infection was associated with decreasing stimulatory capacity of DC. These data demonstrate that functional maturation of DC in response to dengue infection is modified by the presence of virus through IFN‐dependent and ‐independent mechanisms with consequences for the development of adaptive immunity.

TI  - Virion-associated phosphatidylethanolamine promotes TIM1-mediated infection by Ebola, dengue, and West Nile viruses
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 112
SP  - 14682
EP  - 14687
AB  - Significance Many viruses use phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors to gain entry into target cells, and phagocytes use these receptors to clear apoptotic cells. PS receptors mediate these activities by binding PS on the viruses or apoptotic cells. We demonstrate here that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is also a ligand for PS receptors, and that PE plays a key role in apoptotic cell clearance and infection of various pathogenic viruses, including West Nile, dengue, and Ebola viruses. This finding provides significant insights; it clarifies how PS receptors promote viral infection, suggests PE is a useful broad-spectrum antiviral target, and deepens our understanding of apoptosis and the process by which apoptotic cells are cleared. Phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors contribute to two crucial biological processes: apoptotic clearance and entry of many enveloped viruses. In both cases, they recognize PS exposed on the plasma membrane. Here we demonstrate that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is also a ligand for PS receptors and that this phospholipid mediates phagocytosis and viral entry. We show that a subset of PS receptors, including T-cell immunoglobulin (Ig) mucin domain protein 1 (TIM1), efficiently bind PE. We further show that PE is present in the virions of flaviviruses and filoviruses, and that the PE-specific cyclic peptide lantibiotic agent Duramycin efficiently inhibits the entry of West Nile, dengue, and Ebola viruses. The inhibitory effect of Duramycin is specific: it inhibits TIM1-mediated, but not L-SIGN-mediated, virus infection, and it does so by blocking virus attachment to TIM1. We further demonstrate that PE is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells, and promotes their phagocytic uptake by TIM1-expressing cells. Together, our data show that PE plays a key role in TIM1-mediated virus entry, suggest that disrupting PE association with PS receptors is a promising broad-spectrum antiviral strategy, and deepen our understanding of the process by which apoptotic cells are cleared.

TI  - Virulence attenuation of Dengue virus due to augmented glycosaminoglycan-binding affinity and restriction in extraneural dissemination.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 87 Pt 10
SP  - 2791
EP  - 801
AB  - To gain insight into the role of cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in dengue virus (DEN) cell tropism and virulence, DEN-2 mouse brain-adapted vaccine candidate, neurovirulent prototype strain (NGC) and low-passage strain, PUO-218, were passaged in BHK-21 and SW13 cells to isolate variants with high affinity for GAG. Sequence comparisons of parent and passage variants revealed five GAG-binding determinants, which all cluster in a surface-exposed region in domain II of the three-dimensional structure of the DEN envelope protein. Using an infectious cDNA clone of NGC and an NGC/PUO-218 prM-E chimeric clone, it was demonstrated that the GAG-binding determinants augment the specific infectivity for BHK-21 and/or SW13 cells by 10- to 170-fold and in some cases marginally reduce that for Vero cells. This altered cell tropism was due to a greater dependence of the variants on cell surface GAG for attachment/entry, given their increased susceptibility to heparin inhibition. The effect of the GAG-binding determinants on virulence was examined in mice deficient in alpha/beta/gamma interferon responses. High GAG affinity strongly correlated with low neuroinvasiveness due to rapid virus clearance from the blood. It was speculated that this mechanism accounts for the attenuation in primates of some DEN vaccine candidates. Interestingly, the GAG-binding variants did not display marked attenuation of neurovirulence and the opposing effect of enhanced neurovirulence was associated with one determinant (Lys126) already present in mouse brain-adapted NGC. This discrepancy of attenuated neuroinvasiveness and augmented neurovirulence may be reconciled by the existence of different mechanisms of virus dissemination in the brain and in extraneural tissues.

TI  - Virulence difference of five type I dengue viruses and the intrinsic molecular mechanism
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 13
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most important vector-borne virus globally. The safe and effective vaccines are still under development and there are no antiviral drugs for DENV induced diseases. In this study, we obtained five DENV1 isolates (DENV1 A to E) from the outbreak of dengue fever in 2014 of Guangzhou, China, and analyzed their replication efficiency and virulence in vitro and in vivo. The results suggested that among the five DENV1 strains, DENV1 B has the highest replication efficiency in both human and mosquito cells in vitro, also causes the highest mortality to suckling mice. Further study suggested that nonstructural proteins from DENV1B have higher capacity to suppress host interferon signaling. In addition, the NS2B3 protease from DENV1B has higher enzymatic activity compared with that from DENV1 E. Finally, we identified that the 64th amino acid of NS2A and the 55th amino acid of NS2B were two virulence determining sites for DENV1. This study provided new evidences of the molecular mechanisms of DENV virulence.

TI  - Virus Overlay Protein Binding Assay (VOPBA) Reveals Serotype Specific Heterogeneity of Dengue Virus Binding Proteins on HepG2 Human Liver Cells
JF  - Intervirology
VL  - 47
SP  - 370
EP  - 373
AB  - Objective: This study sought to investigate the presence of dengue virus binding proteins expressed on the surface of HepG2 cells and to determine if there were serotype specific differences in binding. Methods: HepG2 cell membrane proteins were extracted and separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with dengue virus serotypes 2, 3 and 4 under varying hybridization conditions. The positions of dengue virus binding proteins were established with a pan-specific anti-dengue virus monoclonal antibody. Results: Dengue virus binding proteins were seen at approximately 78–80, 90, 98, and 102 kD for dengue serotype 2, 90, 130 and 182 kD for dengue serotype 3, and 90 and 130 kD for dengue serotype 4. Binding of the serotypes 3 and 4 was significantly altered by the hybridization conditions, while serotype 2 was affected to a lesser extent. Conclusions: The virus overlay assay used here provides further evidence that there is a serotype specific component regulating the entry of the dengue virus into cells. Given that several virus binding proteins are seen for each serotype, multiple proteins may be required to facilitate the entry of the virus into some cell types.

VL  - 76
SP  - 12242
EP  - 12249
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DV) replication, antibody-enhanced viral infection, and cytokine responses of human primary B lymphocytes (cells) were characterized and compared with those of monocytes. The presence of a replication template (negative-strand RNA intermediate), viral antigens including core and nonstructural proteins, and increasing amounts of virus with time postinfection indicated that DV actively replicated in B cells. Virus infection also induced B cells to produce interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, which have been previously implicated in virus pathogenesis. In addition, a heterologous antibody was able to enhance both virus and cytokine production in B cells. Furthermore, the levels of virus replication, antibody-enhanced virus replication, and cytokine responses observed in B cells were not statistically different from those in monocytes. These results suggest that B cells may play an important role in DV pathogenesis.

TI  - Virus infection participates in the occurrence and development of human diseases through monoamine oxidase
JF  - Reviews in Medical Virology
VL  - 33
AB  - Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is a membrane‐bound mitochondrial enzyme that maintains the steady state of neurotransmitters and other biogenic amines in biological systems through catalytic oxidation and deamination. MAO dysfunction is closely related to human neurological and psychiatric diseases and cancers. However, little is known about the relationship between MAO and viral infections in humans. This review summarises current research on how viral infections participate in the occurrence and development of human diseases through MAO. The viruses discussed in this review include hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, human immunodeficiency virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Epstein‐Barr virus, and human papillomavirus. This review also describes the effects of MAO inhibitors such as phenelzine, clorgyline, selegiline, M‐30, and isatin on viral infectious diseases. This information will not only help us to better understand the role of MAO in the pathogenesis of viruses but will also provide new insights into the treatment and diagnosis of these viral diseases.

AB  - Significance A fraction of the 400 million people infected with dengue annually progresses to severe dengue (SD). Yet, there are currently no biomarkers to predict disease progression. We profiled the landscape of host transcripts and viral RNA in thousands of single blood cells from dengue patients prior to progressing to SD. We discovered cell type-specific immune activation and candidate predictive biomarkers. We also determined preferential virus association with specific cell populations, particularly naive B cells and monocytes. We explored immune activation of bystander cells, clonality and somatic evolution of adaptive immune repertoires, as well as viral genomics. This multifaceted approach could advance understanding of pathogenesis of any viral infection, map an atlas of infected cells, and promote the development of prognostics. Dengue virus (DENV) infection can result in severe complications. However, the understanding of the molecular correlates of severity is limited, partly due to difficulties in defining the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that contain DENV RNA in vivo. Accordingly, there are currently no biomarkers predictive of progression to severe dengue (SD). Bulk transcriptomics data are difficult to interpret because blood consists of multiple cell types that may react differently to infection. Here, we applied virus-inclusive single-cell RNA-seq approach (viscRNA-Seq) to profile transcriptomes of thousands of single PBMCs derived early in the course of disease from six dengue patients and four healthy controls and to characterize distinct leukocyte subtypes that harbor viral RNA (vRNA). Multiple IFN response genes, particularly MX2 in naive B cells and CD163 in CD14+ CD16+ monocytes, were up-regulated in a cell-specific manner before progression to SD. The majority of vRNA-containing cells in the blood of two patients who progressed to SD were naive IgM B cells expressing the CD69 and CXCR4 receptors and various antiviral genes, followed by monocytes. Bystander, non-vRNA–containing B cells also demonstrated immune activation, and IgG1 plasmablasts from two patients exhibited clonal expansions. Lastly, assembly of the DENV genome sequence revealed diversity at unexpected sites. This study presents a multifaceted molecular elucidation of natural dengue infection in humans with implications for any tissue and viral infection and proposes candidate biomarkers for prediction of SD.

TI  - Virus-specific T lymphocytes home to the skin during natural dengue infection
JF  - Science Translational Medicine
VL  - 7
SP  - 278ra35
EP  - 278ra35
AB  - Circulating virus-specific T lymphocytes may contribute to immune surveillance against dengue in the skin. Getting under dengue virus’s skin Dengue virus infection is transmitted by mosquitoes, suggesting that a vaccine targeting the immune response to the skin could have protective effects. Rivino et al. examined individuals with natural dengue infection to determine whether skin-mediated immunity indeed contributes to the fight against dengue. They found that dengue infection induced highly activated CD8+ T cells that express the skin-homing marker cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA). CLA expression by these cells correlated with their ability to traffic to the skin during dengue infection. Notably, CLA was not up-regulated in bystander HCMV-restricted cells in these individuals, suggesting that the skin-targeted homing is pathogen-specific. These data support a role for skin-directed immunosurveillance against dengue and reinforce a skin-targeted vaccine strategy for this virus. Dengue, which is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease afflicting human populations, causes a spectrum of clinical symptoms that include fever, muscle and joint pain, maculopapular skin rash, and hemorrhagic manifestations. Patients infected with dengue develop a broad antigen-specific T lymphocyte response, but the phenotype and functional properties of these cells are only partially understood. We show that natural infection induces dengue-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes that are highly activated and proliferating, exhibit antiviral effector functions, and express CXCR3, CCR5, and the skin-homing marker cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA). In the same patients, bystander human cytomegalovirus –specific CD8+ T cells are also activated during acute dengue infection but do not express the same tissue-homing phenotype. We show that CLA expression by circulating dengue-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells correlates with their in vivo ability to traffic to the skin during dengue infection. The juxtaposition of dengue-specific T cells with virus-permissive cell types at sites of possible dengue exposure represents a previously uncharacterized form of immune surveillance for this virus. These findings suggest that vaccination strategies may need to induce dengue-specific T cells with similar homing properties to provide durable protection against dengue viruses.

TI  - Vitamin D modulates inflammatory response of DENV-2-infected macrophages by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory-liked miRNAs
JF  - Pathogens and Global Health
VL  - 117
SP  - 167
EP  - 180
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue disease caused by dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common vector-borne viral disease worldwide. Currently, no treatment is available to fight dengue symptoms. We and others have demonstrated the antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of VitD3 as a possible therapy for DENV infection. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs responsible for the regulation of cell processes including antiviral defense. Previous transcriptomic analysis showed that VitD3 regulates the expression of genes involved in stress and immune response by inducing specific miRNAs. Here, we focus on the effects of VitD3 supplementation in the regulation of the expression of inflammatory-liked miR-182-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR125b-5p, miR146a-5p, and miR-155-5p during DENV-2 infection of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Further, we evaluated the effects of inhibition of these miRNAs in the innate immune response. Our results showed that supplementation with VitD3 differentially regulated the expression of these inflammatory miRNAs. We also observed that inhibition of miR-182-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-155-5p, led to decreased production of TNF-α and TLR9 expression, while increased the expression of SOCS-1, IFN-β, and OAS1, without affecting DENV replication. By contrast, over-expression of miR-182-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-155-5p significantly decreased DENV-2 infection rates and also DENV-2 replication in MDMs. Our results suggest that VitD3 immunomodulatory effects involve regulation of inflammation-linked miRNAs expression, which might play a key role in the inflammatory response during DENV infection.

TI  - Vitamin D-Regulated MicroRNAs: Are They Protective Factors against Dengue Virus Infection?
JF  - Advances in Virology
VL  - 2016
AB  - Over the last few years, an increasing body of evidence has highlighted the critical participation of vitamin D in the regulation of proinflammatory responses and protection against many infectious pathogens, including viruses. The activity of vitamin D is associated with microRNAs, which are fine tuners of immune activation pathways and provide novel mechanisms to avoid the damage that arises from excessive inflammatory responses. Severe symptoms of an ongoing dengue virus infection and disease are strongly related to highly altered production of proinflammatory mediators, suggesting impairment in homeostatic mechanisms that control the host's immune response. Here, we discuss the possible implications of emerging studies anticipating the biological effects of vitamin D and microRNAs during the inflammatory response, and we attempt to extrapolate these findings to dengue virus infection and to their potential use for disease management strategies.

TI  - Vitamin D-induced LL-37 modulates innate immune responses of human primary macrophages during DENV-2 infection.
JF  - Pathogens and disease
AB  - Epidemics of dengue, an acute and potentially severe disease caused by mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV), pose a major challenge to clinicians and health care services across the sub(tropics). Severe disease onset is associated with a dysregulated inflammatory response to the virus and there are currently no drugs to alleviate disease symptoms. LL-37 is a potent antimicrobial peptide with a wide range of immunoregulatory properties. In this study, we assessed the effect of LL-37 on DENV-2-induced responses in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). We show that simultaneous exposure of exogenous LL-37 and DENV-2 resulted in reduced replication of the virus in MDMs, while the addition of LL-37 post-exposure to DENV-2 did not. Interestingly, the latter condition reduced the production of IL-6 and increased the expression of genes involved in virus sensing and antiviral response. Finally, we demonstrate that low endogenous levels and limited production of LL-37 in MDMs in response to DENV-2 infection can be increased by differentiating MDMs in the presence of Vitamin D (VitD3). Taken together, this study demonstrates that in addition to its antimicrobial properties, LL-37 has immunomodulatory properties in the curse of DENV infection and its production can be increased by VitD3.

TI  - West Nile virus and dengue virus capsid protein negates the antiviral activity of human Sec3 protein through the proteasome pathway
JF  - Cellular Microbiology
VL  - 15
AB  - Flavivirus capsid (C) protein is a key structural component of virus particles. The non‐structural role of C protein in the pathogenesis of arthropod‐borne flaviviruses is not clearly deciphered. This study showed that West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV) utilized C protein to reduce human Sec3p (hSec3p) levels at post‐transcriptional level through activation of chymotrypsin‐like proteolytic function of 20S proteasome. Mutagenesis studies confirmed amino acids 14, 109–114 of WNV C protein and 13, 102–107 of DENV C protein played an important role in activating the proteolytic function of 20S proteasome. Amino acid residues at 14 (WNV) and 13 (DENV) of C protein were important for C protein‐hSec3p binding and physical interaction between C protein and hSec3p was essential to execute hSec3p degradation. Degradation motif required to degrade hSec3p resided between amino acid residues 109–114 of WNV C protein and 102–107 of DENV C protein. Proteasomes, hSec3p binding motif and degradation motif on C protein must be intact for efficient flavivirus production. Clinical isolates of DENV showed more pronounced effect in manipulating the proteasomes and reducing hSec3p levels. This study portrayed the non‐structural function of C protein that helped the flavivirus to nullify the antiviral activity of hSec3p by accelerating its degradation and facilitating efficient binding of elongation factor 1α with flaviviral RNA genome.

TI  - Widespread signatures of local mRNA folding structure selection in four Dengue virus serotypes
JF  - BMC Genomics
VL  - 16
SP  - S4
EP  - S4
AB  - It is known that mRNA folding can affect and regulate various gene expression steps both in living organisms and in viruses. Previous studies have recognized functional RNA structures in the genome of the Dengue virus. However, these studies usually focused either on the viral untranslated regions or on very specific and limited regions at the beginning of the coding sequences, in a limited number of strains, and without considering evolutionary selection. Here we performed the first large scale comprehensive genomics analysis of selection for local mRNA folding strength in the Dengue virus coding sequences, based on a total of 1,670 genomes and 4 serotypes. Our analysis identified clusters of positions along the coding regions that may undergo a conserved evolutionary selection for strong or weak local folding maintained across different viral variants. Specifically, 53-66 clusters for strong folding and 49-73 clusters for weak folding (depending on serotype) aggregated of positions with a significant conservation of folding energy signals (related to partially overlapping local genomic regions) were recognized. In addition, up to 7% of these positions were found to be conserved in more than 90% of the viral genomes. Although some of the identified positions undergo frequent synonymous / non-synonymous substitutions, the selection for folding strength therein is preserved, and thus cannot be trivially explained based on sequence conservation alone. The fact that many of the positions with significant folding related signals are conserved among different Dengue variants suggests that a better understanding of the mRNA structures in the corresponding regions may promote the development of prospective anti- Dengue vaccination strategies. The comparative genomics approach described here can be employed in the future for detecting functional regions in other pathogens with very high mutations rates.

TI  - Wolbachia Biocontrol Strategies for Arboviral Diseases and the Potential Influence of Resident Wolbachia Strains in Mosquitoes
JF  - Current Tropical Medicine Reports
VL  - 3
SP  - 20
EP  - 25
AB  - Arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes are a major cause of human disease worldwide. The absence of vaccines and effective vector control strategies has resulted in the need for novel mosquito control strategies. The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia has been proposed to form the basis for an effective mosquito biocontrol strategy. Resident strains of Wolbachia inhibit viral replication in Drosophila fruit flies and induce a reproductive phenotype known as cytoplasmic incompatibility that allows rapid invasion of insect populations. Transinfection of Wolbachia strains into the principle mosquito vector of dengue virus, Stegomyia aegypti, has resulted in dengue-refractory mosquito lines with minimal effects on mosquito fitness. Wolbachia strains have now been established in wild St. aegypti populations through open releases in dengue-endemic countries. In this review, we outline the current state of Wolbachia-based biocontrol strategies for dengue and discuss the potential impact of resident Wolbachia strains for additional target mosquito species that transmit arboviruses.

TI  - Wolbachia Infection Reduces Blood-Feeding Success in the Dengue Fever Mosquito, Aedes aegypti
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 3
AB  - Background The mosquito Aedes aegypti was recently transinfected with a life-shortening strain of the endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis (wMelPop) as the first step in developing a biocontrol strategy for dengue virus transmission. In addition to life-shortening, the wMelPop-infected mosquitoes also exhibit increased daytime activity and metabolic rates. Here we sought to quantify the blood-feeding behaviour of Wolbachia-infected females as an indicator of any virulence or energetic drain associated with Wolbachia infection. Methodology/Principal Findings In a series of blood-feeding trials in response to humans, we have shown that Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes do not differ in their response time to humans, but that as they age they obtain fewer and smaller blood meals than Wolbachia-uninfected controls. Lastly, we observed a behavioural characteristic in the Wolbachia infected mosquitoes best described as a “bendy” proboscis that may explain the decreased biting success. Conclusions/Significance Taken together the evidence suggests that wMelPop infection may be causing tissue damage in a manner that intensifies with mosquito age and that leads to reduced blood-feeding success. These behavioural changes require further investigation with respect to a possible physiological mechanism and their role in vectorial capacity of the insect. The selective decrease of feeding success in older mosquitoes may act synergistically with other Wolbachia-associated traits including life-shortening and viral protection in biocontrol strategies.

TI  - Wolbachia Inhibits Binding of Dengue and Zika Viruses to Mosquito Cells
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - As traditional approaches to the control of dengue and Zika are insufficient, significant efforts have been made to develop utilization of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia to reduce the ability of mosquitoes to transmit pathogens. Although Wolbachia is known to inhibit flaviviruses in mosquitoes, including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), it remains unclear how the endosymbiont interferes with viral replication cycle. In this study, we have carried out viral binding assays to investigate the impact of the Wolbachia strain wAlbB on the attachment of DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) and ZIKV to Aedes aegypti Aag-2 cells. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to silence a variety of putative mosquito receptors of DENV that were differentially regulated by wAlbB in Aag-2 cells, in order to identify host factors involved in the inhibition of viral binding. Our results showed that, in addition to suppression of viral replication, Wolbachia strongly inhibited binding of both DENV-2 and ZIKV to Aag-2 cells. Moreover, the expression of two putative mosquito DENV receptors – dystroglycan and tubulin – was downregulated by wAlbB, and their knock-down resulted in the inhibition of DENV-2 binding to Aag-2 cells. These results will aid in understanding the Wolbachia-DENV interactions in mosquito and the development of novel control strategies for mosquito-borne diseases.

JF  - Applied and Environmental Microbiology
VL  - 82

EP  - 3120
AB  - ABSTRACT Certain strains of the intracellular endosymbiont Wolbachia can strongly inhibit or block the transmission of viruses such as dengue virus (DENV) by Aedes mosquitoes, and the mechanisms responsible are still not well understood. Direct infusion and liquid chromatography-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry-based lipidomics analyses were conducted using Aedes albopictus Aa23 cells that were infected with the wMel and wMelPop strains of Wolbachia in comparison to uninfected Aa23-T cells. Substantial shifts in the cellular lipid profile were apparent in the presence of Wolbachia. Most significantly, almost all sphingolipid classes were depleted, and some reductions in diacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines were also observed. These lipid classes have previously been shown to be selectively enriched in DENV-infected mosquito cells, suggesting that Wolbachia may produce a cellular lipid environment that is antagonistic to viral replication. The data improve our understanding of the intracellular interactions between Wolbachia and mosquitoes. IMPORTANCE Mosquitoes transmit a variety of important viruses to humans, such as dengue virus and Zika virus. Certain strains of the intracellular bacterial genus called Wolbachia found in or introduced into mosquitoes can block the transmission of viruses, including dengue virus, but the mechanisms responsible are not well understood. We found substantial shifts in the cellular lipid profiles in the presence of these bacteria. Some lipid classes previously shown to be enriched in dengue virus-infected mosquito cells were depleted in the presence of Wolbachia, suggesting that Wolbachia may produce a cellular lipid environment that inhibits mosquito-borne viruses.

TI  - Wolbachia and dengue virus infection in the mosquito Aedes fluviatilis (Diptera: Culicidae)
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue represents a serious threat to human health, with billions of people living at risk of the disease. Wolbachia pipientis is a bacterial endosymbiont common to many insect species. Wolbachia transinfections in mosquito disease vectors have great value for disease control given the bacterium’s ability to spread into wild mosquito populations, and to interfere with infections of pathogens, such as dengue virus. Aedes fluviatilis is a mosquito with a widespread distribution in Latin America, but its status as a dengue vector has not been clarified. Ae. fluviatilis is also naturally infected by the wFlu Wolbachia strain, which has been demonstrated to enhance infection with the avian malarial parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum. We performed experimental infections of Ae. fluviatilis with DENV-2 and DENV-3 isolates from Brazil via injection or oral feeding to provide insight into its competence for the virus. We also examined the effect of the native Wolbachia infection on the virus using a mosquito line where the wFlu infection had been cleared by antibiotic treatment. Through RT-qPCR, we observed that Ae. fluviatilis could become infected with both viruses via either method of infection, although at a lower rate than Aedes aegypti, the primary dengue vector. We then detected DENV-2 and DENV-3 in the saliva of injected mosquitoes, and observed that injection of DENV-3-infected saliva produced subsequent infections in naïve Ae. aegypti. However, across our data we observed no difference in prevalence of infection and viral load between Wolbachia-infected and -uninfected mosquitoes, suggesting that there is no effect of wFlu on dengue virus. Our results highlight that Ae. fluviatilis could potentially serve as a dengue vector under the right circumstances, although further testing is required to determine if this occurs in the field.

TI  - Wolbachia induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent activation of the Toll pathway to control dengue virus in the mosquito Aedes aegypti
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 109
SP  - E23
EP  - E31
AB  - Wolbachia are maternally transmitted symbiotic bacteria that can spread within insect populations because of their unique ability to manipulate host reproduction. When introduced to nonnative mosquito hosts, Wolbachia induce resistance to a number of human pathogens, including dengue virus (DENV), Plasmodium, and filarial nematodes, but the molecular mechanism involved is unclear. In this study, we have deciphered how Wolbachia infection affects the Aedes aegypti host in inducing resistance to DENV. The microarray assay indicates that transcripts of genes with functions related to immunity and reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions are up-regulated in Ae. aegypti infected with Wolbachia. Infection with this bacterium leads to induction of oxidative stress and an increased level of reactive oxygen species in its mosquito host. Reactive oxygen species elevation is linked to the activation of the Toll pathway, which is essential in mediating the expression of antioxidants to counterbalance oxidative stress. This immune pathway also is responsible for activation of antimicrobial peptides—defensins and cecropins. We provide evidence that these antimicrobial peptides are involved in inhibition of DENV proliferation in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. Utilization of transgenic Ae. aegypti and the RNAi depletion approach has been instrumental in proving the role of defensins and cecropins in the resistance of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti to DENV. These results indicate that a symbiotic bacterium can manipulate the host defense system to facilitate its own persistent infection, resulting in a compromise of the mosquito's ability to host human pathogens. Our discoveries will aid in the development of control strategies for mosquito-transmitted diseases.

TI  - Wolbachia strain wMel induces cytoplasmic incompatibility and blocks dengue transmission in Aedes albopictus
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 109
SP  - 255
EP  - 260
AB  - Wolbachia inherited bacteria are able to invade insect populations using cytoplasmic incompatibility and provide new strategies for controlling mosquito-borne tropical diseases, such as dengue. The overreplicating wMelPop strain was recently shown to strongly inhibit the replication of dengue virus when introduced into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, as well as to stimulate chronic immune up-regulation. Here we show that stable introduction of the wMel strain of Drosophila melanogaster into Aedes albopictus, a vector of dengue and other arboviruses, abolished the transmission capacity of dengue virus-challenged mosquitoes. Immune up-regulation was observed in the transinfected line, but at a much lower level than that previously found for transinfected Ae. aegypti. Transient infection experiments suggest that this difference is related to Ae. albopictus immunotolerance of Wolbachia, rather than to the Wolbachia strain used. This study provides an example of strong pathogen inhibition in a naturally Wolbachia-infected mosquito species, demonstrating that this inhibition is not limited to naturally naïve species, and suggests that the Wolbachia strain is more important than host background for viral inhibition. Complete bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility was observed with WT strains infected with the naturally occurring Ae. albopictus Wolbachia, and this provides a mechanism for introducing wMel into natural populations of this species.

JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 110
SP  - 10276
EP  - 10281
AB  - The endosymbiont Wolbachia is common among insects and known for the reproductive manipulations it exerts on hosts as well as inhibition of virus replication in their hosts. Recently, we showed that Wolbachia uses host microRNAs to manipulate host gene expression for its efficient maintenance in the dengue mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. Cytosine methylation is mediated by a group of proteins called DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases, which are structurally and functionally conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. The biological functions of cytosine methylation include host defense, genome stability, gene regulation, developmental promotion of organs, and lifespan regulation. Ae. aegypti has only one DNA methyltransferase gene (AaDnmt2) belonging to the cytosine methyltransferase family 2, which is the most deeply conserved and widely distributed gene among metazoans. Here, we show that in mosquitoes the introduced endosymbiont, Wolbachia, significantly suppresses expression of AaDnmt2, but dengue virus induces expression of AaDnmt2. Interestingly, we found that aae-miR-2940 microRNA, which is exclusively expressed in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, down-regulates the expression of AaDnmt2. Reversely, overexpression of AaDnmt2 in mosquito cells led to inhibition of Wolbachia replication, but significantly promoted replication of dengue virus, suggesting a causal link between this Wolbachia manipulation and the blocking of dengue replication in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. In addition, our findings provide an explanation for hypomethylation of the genome in Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti.

AB  - The obligate endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis is found in a wide range of invertebrates where they are best known for manipulating host reproduction. Recent studies have shown that Wolbachia also can modulate the lifespan of host insects and interfere with the development of human pathogens in mosquito vectors. Despite considerable study, very little is known about the molecular interactions between Wolbachia and its hosts that might mediate these effects. Using microarrays, we show that the microRNA (miRNA) profile of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is significantly altered by the wMelPop-CLA strain of W. pipientis. We found that a host miRNA (aae-miR-2940) is induced after Wolbachia infection in both mosquitoes and cell lines. One target of aae-miR-2940 is the Ae. aegypti metalloprotease gene. Interestingly, expression of the target gene was induced after Wolbachia infection, ectopic expression of the miRNA independent of Wolbachia, or transfection of an artificial mimic of the miRNA into mosquito cells. We also confirmed the interaction of aae-miR-2940 with the target sequences using GFP as a reporter gene. Silencing of the metalloprotease gene in both Wolbachia-infected cells and adult mosquitoes led to a significant reduction in Wolbachia density, as did inhibition of the miRNA in cells. These results indicate that manipulation of the mosquito metalloprotease gene via aae-miR-2940 is crucial for efficient maintenance of the endosymbiont. This report shows how Wolbachia alters the host miRNA profile and provides insight into the mechanisms of host manipulation used by this widespread endosymbiont.

AB  - ABSTRACT Following transfer into the primary arbovirus vector Aedes aegypti, several strains of the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia have been shown to inhibit the transmission of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses, important human pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In addition to pathogen inhibition, many Wolbachia strains manipulate host reproduction, resulting in an invasive capacity of the bacterium in insect populations. This has led to the deployment of Wolbachia as a dengue control tool, and trials have reported significant reductions in transmission in release areas. Here, we discuss the possible mechanisms of Wolbachia-virus inhibition and the implications for long-term success of dengue control. We also consider the evidence presented in several reports that Wolbachia may cause an enhancement of replication of certain viruses under particular conditions, and conclude that these should not cause any concerns with respect to the application of Wolbachia to arbovirus control.

TI  - Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking in mosquito cells is dependent on XRN1-mediated viral RNA degradation and influenced by viral replication rate
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - Wolbachia is currently being developed as a novel tool to block the transmission of dengue viruses (DENV) by Aedes aegypti. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the DENV-blocking phenotype in mosquitoes, including competition for fatty acids like cholesterol, manipulation of host miRNAs and upregulation of innate immune pathways in the mosquito. We examined the various stages in the DENV infection process to better understand the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking (WMVB). Our results suggest that infection with Wolbachia does not inhibit DENV binding or cell entry, but reduces virus replication. In contrast to a previous report, we also observed a similar reduction in replication of West Nile virus (WNV). This reduced replication is associated with rapid viral RNA degradation in the cytoplasm. We didn’t find a role for host miRNAs in WMVB. Further analysis showed that the 3’ end of the virus subgenomic RNA was protected and accumulated over time suggesting that the degradation is XRN1-mediated. We also found that sub genomic flavivirus RNA accumulation inactivated XRN1 in mosquito cells in the absence of Wolbachia and led to enhancement of RNA degradation in its presence. Depletion of XRN1 decreased WMVB which was associated with a significant increase in DENV RNA. We also observed that WMVB is influenced by virus MOI and rate of virus replication. A comparatively elevated blocking was observed for slowly replicating DENV, compared to WNV. Similar results were obtained while analysing different DENV serotypes.

TI  - Wolbachia’s Deleterious Impact on Aedes aegypti Egg Development: The Potential Role of Nutritional Parasitism
JF  - Insects
VL  - 11
AB  - Simple Summary Mosquito-borne viral diseases such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya cause a significant global health burden and are currently increasing in outbreak frequency and geographical reach. Wolbachia pipientis, an endosymbiotic bacterium, offers a solution to this. When Wolbachia is introduced into the main mosquito vector of these viruses, Aedes aegypti, it alters the mosquito’s reproductive biology, as well as reducing the ability of the mosquitoes to transmit viruses. These traits can be leveraged to reduce virus transmission within a community by mass releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. However, Wolbachia has some negative effects on Aedes aegypti fitness, particularly egg longevity, and the reason behind this remains ambiguous. Insect fitness is very important for the success for Wolbachia-biocontrol strategies as they rely on the released insects being competitive with the wild mosquito population. This review summarises the fitness effects of Wolbachia on Aedes aegypti and investigates the possible contribution of Wolbachia as a nutritional parasite in lowering host fitness. It proposes the next stages of research that can be conducted to address nutritional parasitism to aid in the expansion of Wolbachia-based disease management programs worldwide. Abstract The artificial introduction of the endosymbiotic bacterium, Wolbachia pipientis, into Aedes (Ae.) aegypti mosquitoes reduces the ability of mosquitoes to transmit human pathogenic viruses and is now being developed as a biocontrol tool. Successful introgression of Wolbachia-carrying Ae. aegypti into native mosquito populations at field sites in Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia has been associated with reduced disease prevalence in the treated community. In separate field programs, Wolbachia is also being used as a mosquito population suppression tool, where the release of male only Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti prevents the native mosquito population from producing viable eggs, subsequently suppressing the wild population. While these technologies show great promise, they require mass rearing of mosquitoes for implementation on a scale that has not previously been done. In addition, Wolbachia induces some negative fitness effects on Ae. aegypti. While these fitness effects differ depending on the Wolbachia strain present, one of the most consistent and significant impacts is the shortened longevity and viability of eggs. This review examines the body of evidence behind Wolbachia’s negative effect on eggs, assesses nutritional parasitism as a key cause and considers how these impacts could be overcome to achieve efficient large-scale rearing of these mosquitoes.

TI  - XAF1 contributes to dengue virus‐induced apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells

VL  - 27

EP  - 1073
AB  - The mechanism of vascular leakage in severe dengue infection remains unclear. Here, we used primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the EA.hy926 cell line to study the molecular events that occur after dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) infection. DENV2‐induced apoptosis was confirmed using nuclear staining, TUNEL assay, and electron microscopy. A genome‐wide transcriptome analysis was performed using a microarray of DENV2‐infected HUVECs. Notably, interferon‐inducible genes were differentially expressed after DENV2 infection. Prominent among these genes was the X chromosome‐linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)‐associated factor 1 (XAF1; up‐regulated 1.2‐fold in the microarray analysis and ~8‐fold by qRT‐PCR after DENV2 infection). XAF1 protein levels were up‐regulated after DENV2 infection in both HUVECs and EA.hy926 cells. Evidence indicated interaction between XAF1 and XIAP during DENV2 infection based on their cellular localization, as observed by confocal microscopy and the coimmunoprecipitation of XIAP with an anti‐XAF1 antibody. Next, recombinant EA.hy926 cell lines in which XAF1 was either knocked down or overexpressed were constructed. The expression levels of the apoptosis‐related genes caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, and poly‐(ADP‐ribose) polymerase (PARP) were down‐regulated in the XAF1 knockdown (24–48 h postinfection) but were up‐regulated in XAF1 overexpressing cells (36 h postinfection). This is the first study of the role of XAF1 in promoting apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells after DENV2 infection.—Long, X., Li, Y., Qi, Y., Xu, J., Wang, Z., Zhang, X., Zhang, D., Zhang, L., Huang, J.

TI  - XBP1-Mediated BiP/GRP78 Upregulation Copes with Oxidative Stress in Mosquito Cells during Dengue 2 Virus Infection
JF  - BioMed Research International
VL  - 2017
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENVs) cause dengue fever which is an important mosquito-borne disease in tropical areas. Generally, DENV does not cause cellular damage in mosquito cells. However, alterations in cytosolic calcium ions ([Ca2+]cyt) and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), as well as accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide anions (O2∙−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), can be detected in C6/36 cells with DENV2 infection. Evident upregulation of BiP/GRP78 also appeared at 24 h postinfection in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells. As expression of BiP/GRP78 mRNA was reduced when the transcription factor X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP1) was knocked down in C6/36 cells, it demonstrated that BiP/GRP78 is the target gene regulated by the XBP1 signal pathway. We further demonstrated that the expression and splicing activity of XBP1 were upregulated in parallel with DENV2 infection in C6/36 cells. In C6/36 cells with BiP/GRP78 overexpression, oxidative stress indicators including [Ca2+]cyt, MMP, O2∙−, and H2O2 were all pushed back to normal. Taken together, DENV2 activates XBP1 at earlier stage of infection, followed by upregulating BiP/GRP78 in mosquito cells. This regulatory pathway contributes a cascade in relation to oxidative stress alleviation. The finding provides insights into elucidating how mosquitoes can healthily serve as a vector of arboviruses in nature.

TI  - Y Box-binding Protein-1 Binds to the Dengue Virus 3′-Untranslated Region and Mediates Antiviral Effects*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 282
SP  - 30497
EP  - 30508
AB  - Dengue virus, a member of the family Flaviviridae, poses a serious public health threat worldwide. Dengue virus is a positive-sense RNA virus that harbors a genome of ∼10.7 kb. Replication of dengue virus is mediated coordinately by cis-acting genomic sequences, viral proteins, and host cell factors. We have isolated and identified several host cell factors from baby hamster kidney cell extracts that bind with high specificity and high affinity to sequences within the untranslated regions of the dengue virus genome. Among the factors identified, Y box-binding protein-1 (YB-1) and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2/B1, and hnRNP Q, bind to the dengue virus 3′-untranslated region. Further analysis indicated that YB-1 binds to the dengue virus 3′ stem loop, a conserved structural feature located at the 3′ terminus of the 3′-untranslated region of many flaviviruses. Analysis of the impact of YB-1 on replication of dengue virus in YB-1+/+ and YB-1–/– mouse embryo fibroblasts indicated that host YB-1 mediates an antiviral effect. Further studies demonstrated that this antiviral impact is due, at least in part, to a repressive role of YB-1 on dengue virus translation via a mechanism that requires viral genomic sequences. These results suggest a novel role for YB-1 as an antiviral host cell factor.

TI  - Y-Box Binding Protein 1 Interacts with Dengue Virus Nucleocapsid and Mediates Viral Assembly
JF  - mBio
VL  - 13
AB  - The global incidence of dengue virus (DENV) infections has steadily increased over the past decades representing an enormous challenge for public health. During infection, DENV viral RNA interacts with numerous host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that aid viral replication and thus constitute potential molecular targets to curb infection. ABSTRACT Infection with dengue virus (DENV) induces vast rearrangements of the endoplasmic reticulum, which allows the compartmentalization of viral RNA replication and particle assembly. Both processes occur in concert with viral and cellular proteins. Prior studies from our group suggest that the host RNA-binding protein (RBP) Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) is required for a late step in the DENV replication cycle. Here we report that YBX1 interacts with the viral nucleocapsid, distributes to DENV assembly sites and is required for efficient assembly of intracellular infectious virions and their secretion. Genetic ablation of YBX1 decreased the spatial proximity between capsid and envelope, increased the susceptibility of envelope to proteinase K mediated degradation, resulted in the formation of rough empty-looking particles, and decreased the secretion of viral particles. We propose a model wherein YBX1 enables the interaction between the viral nucleocapsid with the structural protein E, which is required for proper assembly of intracellular virus particles and their secretion. IMPORTANCE The global incidence of dengue virus (DENV) infections has steadily increased over the past decades representing an enormous challenge for public health.

These results provide important insights into DENV assembly, revealing novel functions of host RBPs during viral infection and opening new avenues for antiviral intervention.

EP  - 1360
AB  - Zika virus has emerged in the Americas, where dengue virus is endemic. Among the 4 serotypes of dengue virus, antibody-dependent enhancement is thought to enhance viral replication and disease severity. Reports suggest that anti-dengue virus antibody may enhance Zika virus replication. We investigated whether Zika virus antibodies enhance dengue virus replication, by exposing C57Bl/6 mice to Zika virus. Polyclonal serum was verified for strong Zika virus-neutralizing, dengue virus-subneutralizing capacity. Then we determined the enhancement capabilities of Zika virus-immune serum for dengue virus in vitro. We showed that Zika virus antibodies have the ability to enhance dengue virus infections, which is important, because in many Zika virus-affected areas, dengue virus is expected to remain endemic.

JF  - Reviews in medical virology
VL  - 35 1
SP  - e70014
EP  - 
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are two major mosquito-borne flaviviruses that pose a significant threat to the global public health system, particularly in tropical regions. The clinical outcomes related to these viral pathogens can vary from self-limiting asymptomatic infections to various forms of life-threatening pathological conditions such as haemorrhagic disorders. In addition to the direct effects of the viral pathogens, immune processes play also a significant function in the development of diseases mediated by ZIKV and DENV. Studing these processes is important for developing safer vaccines and targeted therapeutic strategies. These viruses have been reported to trigger various autoimmune disorders affecting different parts of human organ systems. It also has been shown that preexisting immunity to ZIKV or DENV can impact the outcome of subsequent infections caused by another virus. ZIKV and DENV infection can promote the development of autoimmune disorders by different mechanisms, such as molecular mimicry and autoantibody formation. The present review provides an overview of various autoimmune disorders associated with ZIKV and DENV infection and their potential underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Zika but not Dengue virus infection limits NF-κB activity in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and suppresses their ability to activate T cells
JF  - Nature Communications
VL  - 16
AB  - Understanding flavivirus immunity is critical for the development of pan-flavivirus vaccines. Dendritic cells (DC) coordinate antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses, and they can be targeted by flaviviruses as a mechanism of immune evasion. Using an unbiased genome-wide approach designed to specifically identify flavivirus-modulated pathways, we found that, while dengue virus (DENV) robustly activates DCs, Zika virus (ZIKV) causes minimal activation of genes involved in DC activation, maturation, and antigen presentation, reducing cytokine secretion and the stimulation of allogeneic and peptide-specific T cell responses. Mechanistically, ZIKV inhibits DC maturation by suppressing NF-κB p65 recruitment and the subsequent transcription of proinflammatory and DC maturation-related genes. Thus, we identify a divergence in the effects of ZIKV and DENV on the host T cell response, highlighting the need to factor such differences into the design of anti-flavivirus vaccines.

TI  - Zinc Chelation Specifically Inhibits Early Stages of Dengue Virus Replication by Activation of NF-κB and Induction of Antiviral Response in Epithelial Cells
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 10
AB  - Zinc is an essential micronutrient which regulates diverse physiological functions and has been shown to play a crucial role in viral infections. Zinc has a necessary role in the replication of many viruses, however, antiviral action of zinc has also been demonstrated in in vitro infection models most likely through induction of host antiviral responses. Therefore, depending on the host machinery that the virus employs at different stages of infection, zinc may either facilitate, or inhibit virus infection. In this study, we show that zinc plays divergent roles in rotavirus and dengue virus infections in epithelial cells. Dengue virus infection did not perturb the epithelial barrier functions despite the release of virus from the basolateral surface whereas rotavirus infection led to disruption of epithelial junctions. In rotavirus infection, zinc supplementation post-infection did not block barrier disruption suggesting that zinc does not affect rotavirus life-cycle or protects epithelial barriers post-infection suggesting the involvement of cellular pathways in the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation in enteric infections. Zinc depletion by N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN) inhibited dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection but had no effect on rotavirus. Time-of-addition experiments suggested that zinc chelation affected both early and late stages of dengue virus infectious cycle and zinc chelation abrogated dengue virus RNA replication. We show that transient zinc chelation induces ER stress and antiviral response by activating NF-kappaB leading to induction of interferon signaling. These results suggest that modulation of zinc homeostasis during virus infection could be a component of host antiviral response and altering zinc homeostasis may act as a potent antiviral strategy against flaviviruses.

TI  - Zinc Finger Protein ZFP36L1 Inhibits Flavivirus Infection by both 5′-3′ XRN1 and 3′-5′ RNA-Exosome RNA Decay Pathways
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 96
AB  - Cellular RNA-binding proteins are among the first lines of defense against various viruses, particularly RNA viruses. ZFP36L1 belongs to the CCCH-type zinc-finger protein family and has RNA-binding activity; it has been reported to bind directly to the AU-rich elements (AREs) of a subset of cellular mRNAs and then lead to mRNA decay by recruiting mRNA-degrading enzymes. ABSTRACT Zinc-finger protein 36, CCCH type-like 1 (ZFP36L1), containing tandem CCCH-type zinc-finger motifs with an RNA-binding property, plays an important role in cellular RNA metabolism mainly by RNA decay pathways. Recently, we demonstrated that human ZFP36L1 has potent antiviral activity against influenza A virus infection. However, its role in the host defense response against flaviviruses has not been addressed. Here, we demonstrate that ZFP36L1 functions as a host innate defender against flaviviruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DENV). Overexpression of ZFP36L1 reduced JEV and DENV infection, and ZFP36L1 knockdown enhanced viral replication. ZFP36L1 destabilized the JEV genome by targeting and degrading viral RNA mediated by both 5′-3′ XRN1 and 3′-5′ RNA-exosome RNA decay pathways. Mutation in both zinc-finger motifs of ZFP36L1 disrupted RNA-binding and antiviral activity. Furthermore, the viral RNA sequences specifically recognized by ZFP36L1 were mapped to the 3′-untranslated region of the JEV genome with the AU-rich element (AUUUA) motif. We extend the function of ZFP36L1 to host antiviral defense by directly binding and destabilizing the viral genome via recruiting cellular mRNA decay machineries. IMPORTANCE Cellular RNA-binding proteins are among the first lines of defense against various viruses, particularly RNA viruses. ZFP36L1 belongs to the CCCH-type zinc-finger protein family and has RNA-binding activity; it has been reported to bind directly to the AU-rich elements (AREs) of a subset of cellular mRNAs and then lead to mRNA decay by recruiting mRNA-degrading enzymes. However, the antiviral potential of ZFP36L1 against flaviviruses has not yet been fully demonstrated. Here, we reveal the antiviral potential of human ZFP36L1 against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DENV). ZFP36L1 specifically targeted the ARE motif within viral RNA and triggered the degradation of viral RNA transcripts via cellular degrading enzymes 5′-3′ XRN1 and 3′-5′ RNA exosome. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how human ZFP36L1 serves as a host antiviral factor to restrict flavivirus replication.

EP  - 97
AB  - INTRODUCTION
Dengue infection demonstrates a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations from mild disease (dengue fever) to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever, but the immunopathogenic mechanisms involved in disease severity are not clear.


OBJECTIVE
Differentially expressed genes associated to immune response were identified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Colombian children with dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microarray analysis was used as a tool to establish and compare transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of six children in acute phase of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The commercial gene chip used was Affymnetrix GeneChip HG_U133_Plus_2.


RESULTS
Dengue hemorrhagic fever patients expressed interleukin 6, chemokines, complement proteins and pentraxin 3, along with the lymphocyte inhibitors lymphocyte-activation gene 3 and cathepsin L1. An interaction model for these genes showed tissue factor playing a central role in the network generated. In contrast, dengue fever patients expressed cytokines, complement and the leukotrienes inhibitors lactotransferrin, C1 inhibitor, and leukotriene-B (4-omega-hydroxylase 2).


CONCLUSIONS
These results indicate that in dengue fever, cytokine and complement inhibitors are able to limit endothelial damage and prevent increases in vascular permeability, whereas dengue- hemorrhagic fever patients have immune cell dysfunction and unregulated complement and cytokine action. This leads to "hypercoagulation" and endothelial damage, thereby increasing disease severity. Verification of the pathogenic role of the identified molecules will contribute to understanding of dengue pathogenesis and lead to rational development of therapeutic drugs.

EP  - 143
AB  - INTRODUCTION
Dengue virus replication has been considered mainly cytoplasmic, however, studies indicate that some flaviviruses may use the intranuclear pathway as part of the machinery that the virus uses to increase infection capacity in the host cell. This paper describes alterations at nuclear level in the cell infected with dengue, which are likely involved in the virus replication processes.


OBJECTIVE
This paper addresses the ultrastructural observations of C6/36 cells of the Aedes albopictus mosquito infected with dengue virus type 2.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
C6/36 cells were infected in culture medium with the serum of a patient positively diagnosed for dengue 2. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 10 days and the cytopathic effect was assessed. The cells were processed for immunofluorescence assays and transmission electron microscopy.


RESULTS
The immunofluorescence assays confirmed the presence of viral protein E associated with cellular syncytia in the culture. In the ultrastructural study, the infected cells showed vesicular-tubular structures and dilated cisterns of the endoplasmic reticulum at the cytoplasmic level. Viral particles were found exclusively in cytoplasm localized within the vacuoles. Nuclei of cellular syncytia showed membrane structures arranged in a circular shape and, in some cases, these syncytia displayed lysis; in no case viral particles were observed at the nuclear level.


CONCLUSIONS
The ultrastructural alterations of nuclei in cells infected with the dengue virus using electron microscopy techniques had not been reported before, as far as we know. It is likely that such modifications are associated with replicative processes at an intranuclear level as an alternate replication mechanism.

AB  - Dengue fever, caused by dengue virus (DENV) infection, is one of the most important diseases in the world, not only due to the high morbidity/mortality rates it causes, but also because of its great economic and social impact in tropical/subtropical countries. DENV infection has a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infection or infection with mild symptoms to severe dengue that can lead to death. At present, no etiological treatment or effective globally distributed vaccine against the four DENV serotypes exists. Despite great efforts made to understand the mechanism associated with DENV disease pathogenesis the causes leading to severe dengue presentation have not been clarified. Some hypotheses seek to give a biological and physiological explanation to the clinical manifestations that appear during the infection. Based on the evidence that after contact with dendritic cells DENV alters the functionality of these cells, this review aims to describe the most relevant findings regarding the importance of dendritic cells in the context of DENV infection and progression of the illness.

AB  - INTRODUCTION
The genetic makeup of the host contributes to the clinical profile of dengue. This could be due to the effect of variants in the genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the association between the variants of three polymorphisms in TNFA, IL6 and IFNG candidate genes with dengue severity in a sample of Colombian population.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We evaluated the rs1800750, rs2069843, and rs2069705 polymorphisms in TNFA, IL6 and IFNG candidate genes, respectively, in 226 patients with dengue infection. The genotypes were typed using both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). To determine the risk of different dengue phenotypes, we compared allele frequencies with chi-square and genotypes and haplotypes using logistic regression. Finally, these analyzes were adjusted with data from self-identification or the ancestral genetic component.


RESULTS
The A allele in the rs2069843 polymorphism, adjusted by self-identification, was associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever cases in Afro-Colombians. In the entire sample, this polymorphism, adjusted by the ancestral genetic component, was reproducible. In addition, there were significant associations between GGT and GAC allelic combinations of rs1800750, rs2069843, and rs2069705 in dengue hemorrhagic fever patients, with and without adjustment by ancestral genetic component. Additionally, the AGC allelic combination produced 58.03 pg/ml of interleukin-6 more than the GGC combination, regardless of European, Amerindian and African genetic components.


CONCLUSIONS
The variants of GGT and GAC polymorphisms of rs1800750, rs2069843, and rs2069705 in the TNFA, IL6 and IFNG genes, respectively, were correlated with the susceptibility to dengue severity in a sample of Colombian population.

AB  - Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that represents an important emerging infectious disease and is an international health concern. Currently, there is no vaccine or effective antiviral therapy to prevent or to treat dengue virus infection. The slow progress in developing antiviral agents might be alleviated by the availability of efficient high-throughput anti-dengue virus screening assays. In this study, we report an immunofluorescence image-based assay suitable for identification of small molecule inhibitors of dengue virus infection and replication. Using this assay, we have discovered that inhibitors of the c-Src protein kinase exhibit a potent inhibitory effect on dengue virus (serotypes 1–4) and murine flavivirus Modoc. Mechanism of action studies demonstrated that the c-Src protein kinase inhibitor dasatinib prevents the assembly of dengue virions within the virus-induced membranous replication complex. These results demonstrate that this cell-based screen may provide a powerful means to identify new potential targets for anti-dengue drug development while simultaneously providing pharmacological probes to investigate dengue virus–host cell interactions at the biochemical level. Given the simplicity and excellent reproducibility of the assay, it should be useful in high-throughput screens of both small molecule and RNAi libraries when implemented on a robotic image-based high-throughput screen (HTS) platform. Given the reasonable clinical safety of inhibitors such as dasatinib and AZD0530, inhibitors of c-Src protein kinase may have the potential to become a new class of anti-dengue viral therapeutic agents.

TI  - cDNA‐AFLP analysis of differential gene expression in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) upon dengue virus infection
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 79
AB  - In infectious diseases, the disease pathogenesis is the outcome of the interaction between the genome of the host and the genome of the pathogen. Despite the wide distribution of dengue infections in the world, and the large number of annual infections, few studies have investigated how the dengue genome alters the global transcriptional profile of the host cell. To investigate alterations in the liver cell transcriptome in response to dengue virus infection, liver cells (HepG2) were infected with dengue serotype 2 at MOI 5 and at 3 days post‐infection RNA extracted and analyzed by cDNA‐AFLP in parallel with mock‐infected cells. From 73 primer combinations over 5,000 transcription‐derived fragments (TDFs) were observed, of which approximately 10% were regulated differentially in response to infection. Sixty‐five TDFs were subsequently cloned and sequenced and 27 unique gene transcripts identified. Semi‐quantitative reverse transcription (RT)‐PCR was used to validate the expression of 12 of these genes and 10 transcripts (CK2, KIAA509, HSP70, AK3L, NIPA, PHIP, RiboS4, JEM‐1, MALT1, and HSI12044) were confirmed to be differentially regulated, with four transcripts (HSP70, NIPA, RiboS4, and JEM‐1) showing a greater than twofold regulation. These results suggest that the expression of a large number of genes is altered in response to dengue virus infection of liver cells, and that cDNA‐AFLP is a useful tool for obtaining information on both characterized and as yet uncharacterized transcripts whose expression is altered during the infection process.

TI  - miR-142 Targets TIM-1 in Human Endothelial Cells: Potential Implications for Stroke, COVID-19, Zika, Ebola, Dengue, and Other Viral Infections
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 23
AB  - T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) has been recently identified as one of the factors involved in the internalization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human cells, in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), neuropilin-1, and others. We hypothesized that specific microRNAs could target TIM-1, with potential implications for the management of patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). By combining bioinformatic analyses and functional assays, we identified miR-142 as a specific regulator of TIM-1 transcription. Since TIM-1 has been implicated in the regulation of endothelial function at the level of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its levels have been shown to be associated with stroke and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, we validated miR-142 as a functional modulator of TIM-1 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). Taken together, our results indicate that miR-142 targets TIM-1, representing a novel strategy against cerebrovascular disorders, as well as systemic complications of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.

TI  - miR-146a Inhibits dengue-virus-induced autophagy by targeting TRAF6
JF  - Archives of Virology
VL  - 162
SP  - 3645
EP  - 3659
AB  - During dengue virus (DENV) infection, the virus manipulates different cellular pathways to assure productive replication, including autophagy. However, it remains unclear how this autophagic process is regulated. Here, we have demonstrated a novel role for the microRNA miR-146a in negatively regulating the cellular autophagic pathway in DENV-infected A549 cells and THP-1 cells. Overexpression of miR-146a significantly blocked DENV2-induced autophagy, and LNA-mediated inhibition of miR-146a counteracted these effects. Moreover, co-overexpression of TRAF6, a target of miR-146a, significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-146a on autophagy. Notably, treatment with recombinant IFN-β fully restored the autophagic activity in TRAF6-silenced cells. Furthermore, our data showed that, in DENV2-infected A549 cells, autophagy promoted a pro-inflammatory response to significantly increase TNF-α and IL-6 production. Taken together, our results define a novel role for miR-146a as a negative regulator of DENV-induced autophagy and identify TRAF6 as a key target of this microRNA in modulating the DENV-autophagy interaction.

TI  - miR-281, an abundant midgut-specific miRNA of the vector mosquito Aedes albopictus enhances dengue virus replication
JF  - Parasites & Vectors
VL  - 7
AB  - Emerging evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in host-virus interaction. We previously reported that some miRNAs were differentially expressed in sugar-fed and blood-fed females of Aedes albopictus (Ae. albopictus). Here, we analysis the role in the host-virus system of an abundant midgut-specific miRNA in the mosquito Ae. albopictus. The expression profiles of miR-281 in different body parts of Ae. albopictus and following dengue virus infection were determined using RT-qPCR and Northern blot. miR-281 mimics, antagomiRs and corresponding negative controls were designed and their overexpression and knock-down efficiency were analyzed by qRT-PCR after transfecting the mosquito cell lines C6/36, and also by injecting female mosquitoes. Dengue virus serotype-2 (DENV-2) viral genomic RNA abundance was determined by RT-qPCR. The levels of DENV-2 E protein were detected using Western blot. Virus titers were tested using TCID50. RNAhybrid was used to predict targets of miR-281 in the DENV-2 genome. The EGFP plasmid-based reporter system was used to investigate the interaction between miR-281 and the predicted binding site in the C6/36 cell line. miR-281 is specifically expressed in the female midgut where dengue virus first invades. After DENV-2 infection, this miRNA is up-regulated in response to viral infection. Functional intervention analyses in vitro with specifically designed miR-281 mimics and corresponding antagomiRs indicated that miR-281 enhances DENV-2 viral replication. Further depletion of miR-281 in female mosquitoes by injection of its specific antagomiRs led to a significant reduction in DENV-2 abundance. The interaction between miR-281 and its predicted target sequence, the DENV-2 genomic 5'-untranslated region (UTR), is confirmed in the context of a plasmid-based reporter system. These findings confirm that miR-281, an abundant midgut-specific miRNA, facilitates DENV-2 replication.

TI  - miR-383 Regulates Hepatic Lipid Homeostasis and Response to Dengue Virus Infection.
JF  - ACS infectious diseases
AB  - Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs), as endogenous noncoding RNAs that inhibit mRNA translation, have been identified to broadly possess functional roles in regulating cellular signaling and metabolic processes due to their chemical and biological properties. In addition, they have emerged to be of critical importance in modulating host-virus interactions, especially for RNA viruses. Herein, we discovered that miR-383-5p targets certain lipid and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways and restricts Dengue virus (DENV) infection in hepatic cells. Global transcriptomics analysis of Huh7 human hepatoma cells overexpressing miR-383-5p revealed enrichment of lipid and cholesterol metabolic processes. Bioinformatics analysis of genes repressed in miR-383-5p overexpressing cells divulged the repression of a key target PLA2G4A, a pro-viral host factor essential for the production of infectious DENV particles. Our study demonstrated the effectiveness of miRNA mimics as tools to study cellular signaling pathways that contribute to viral pathogenesis. Overall, our study identifies miR-383-5p as an interesting host factor during DENV propagation and highlights a potential therapeutic role in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and an antiviral response to DENV.

TI  - miR-573 rescues endothelial dysfunction during dengue infection under PPARγ regulation
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Early prognosis of abnormal vasculopathy is essential for effective clinical management of severe dengue patients. An exaggerated interferon (IFN) response and release of vasoactive factors from endothelial cells cause vasculopathy. This study shows that dengue 2 (DENV2) infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) results in differentially regulated miRNAs important for endothelial function. miR-573 was significantly down-regulated in DENV2-infected HUVEC due to decreased Peroxisome Proliferator Activator Receptor Gamma (PPARγ) activity. Restoring miR-573 expression decreased endothelial permeability by suppressing the expression of vasoactive angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2). We also found that miR-573 suppressed the proinflammatory IFN response through direct downregulation of toll like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression. Our study provides a novel insight into miR-573 mediated regulation of endothelial function during DENV2 infection which can be further translated into a potential therapeutic and prognostic agent for severe dengue patients.

TI  - miR-927 has pro-viral effects during acute and persistent infection with dengue virus type 2 in C6/36 mosquito cells.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is an important flavivirus that is transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes, where it can establish a persistent infection underlying vertical and horizontal transmission. However, the exact mechanism of persistent DENV infection is not well understood. Recently miR-927 was found to be upregulated in C6/36-HT cells at 57 weeks of persistent infection (C6-L57), suggesting its participation during this type of infection. The aim of this study was to determine the role of miR-927 during infection with DENV type 2. The results indicate an overexpression of miR-927 in C6-L57 cells and acutely infected cells according to the time of infection and the m.o.i. used. The downregulation of miR-927 in C6-L57 cells results in a reduction of both viral titre and viral genome copy number. The overexpression of miR-927 in C6-L40 and C6/36 cells infected at an m.o.i. of 0.1 causes an increase in both viral titre and viral genome copy number, suggesting a pro-viral activity of miR-927. In silico prediction analysis reveals target mRNAs for miR-927 are implicated in post-translational modifications (SUMO), translation factors (eIF-2B), the innate immune system (NKIRAS), exocytosis (EXOC-2), endocytosis (APM1) and the cytoskeleton (FLN). The expression levels of FLN were the most affected by both miR-927 overexpression and inhibition, and FLN was determined to be a direct target of miR-927 by a dual-luciferase gene reporter assay. FLN has been associated with the regulation of the Toll pathway and either overexpression or downregulation of miR-927 resulted in expression changes of antimicrobial peptides (Cecropins A and G, and Defensin D) involved in the Toll pathway response.

TI  - miRNA Genes of an Invasive Vector Mosquito, Aedes albopictus
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 8
AB  - Aedes albopictus, a vector of Dengue and Chikungunya viruses, is a robust invasive species in both tropical and temperate environments. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and biological processes including embryonic development, innate immunity and infection. While a number of miRNAs have been discovered in some mosquitoes, no comprehensive effort has been made to characterize them from different developmental stages from a single species. Systematic analysis of miRNAs in Ae. albopictus will improve our understanding of its basic biology and inform novel strategies to prevent virus transmission. Between 10–14 million Illumina sequencing reads per sample were obtained from embryos, larvae, pupae, adult males, sugar-fed and blood-fed adult females. A total of 119 miRNA genes represented by 215 miRNA or miRNA star (miRNA*) sequences were identified, 15 of which are novel. Eleven, two, and two of the newly-discovered miRNA genes appear specific to Aedes, Culicinae, and Culicidae, respectively. A number of miRNAs accumulate predominantly in one or two developmental stages and the large number that showed differences in abundance following a blood meal likely are important in blood-induced mosquito biology. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the targets of all Ae. albopictus miRNAs provides a useful starting point for the study of their functions in mosquitoes. This study is the first systematic analysis of miRNAs based on deep-sequencing of small RNA samples of all developmental stages of a mosquito species. A number of miRNAs are related to specific physiological states, most notably, pre- and post-blood feeding. The distribution of lineage-specific miRNAs is consistent with mosquito phylogeny and the presence of a number of Aedes-specific miRNAs likely reflects the divergence between the Aedes and Culex genera.

TI  - miRNome analysis reveals mir-155-5p as a protective factor to dengue infection in a resistant Thai cohort
JF  - Medical Microbiology and Immunology
VL  - 214
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a global health threat, with approximately 390 million infections annually, ranging from mild dengue fever to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. MicroRNA (miRNA) are crucial post-transcriptional regulators which may regulate host resistance to DENV infection. This study aimed to identify miRNAs involved in natural resistance to DENV infection. Individuals from a dengue-endemic area were classified as susceptible (SD) or resistant (RD) according to their anti-DENV antibody status. RD individuals were seronegative despite high local DENV infection prevalence. Monocytes susceptibility to DENV infection was assessed in vitro. The miRNome profiles of the monocytes from 7 individuals per group were assessed upon mock or DENV-2 infection. The antiviral effect of differentially expressed miRNAs was analyzed using miRNA mimics in HeLa cells followed by infection with DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 serotypes. We performed RNA-seq on miRNA mimic-transfected cells to identify miRNA-targeted genes interacting with DENV proteins. Monocytes from RD individuals exhibit lower DENV-2 production in vitro. The miRNAs miR-155, miR-132-3p, miR-576-5p were overexpressed in monocytes from RD group upon DENV-2 infection. The transfection of miR-155-5p mimic reduced DENV infection and viral production in HeLa cells, regulating 18 genes interacting with DENV proteins and downregulating target genes involved in interferon response, TP53 regulation, apoptosis, and vesicle trafficking (e.g. HSD17B12, ANXA2). Therefore, we show that monocytes from RD individuals show a distinct miRNA expression profile and reduced viral production. In vitro miR-155-5p upregulation induces an antiviral state, revealing potential therapeutic targets to treat dengue.

Dengue epidemics have spread from the southern coastal regions to the relatively northern and western regions since 1990s. Dengue has become an emerging public health problem in the southern coastal regions. microRNAs (miRNAs) are short non‐coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post‐transcriptional level. A highly abundant miRNA, miR‐252, was induced more than threefold after dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV‐2) infection in the Ae. albopictus C6/36 cell line. Transfection with miR‐252 inhibitor resulted in the increase of DENV‐2 RNA copies and the up‐regulation of DENV‐2 envelop protein (E protein) expression, whereas over expression of miR‐252 with its mimic decreased DENV RNA copies and the down‐regulation of E protein expression. MiR‐252 mimic reduced luciferase activity of a luciferase reporter that contained the predicted miR‐252 target on the DENV‐2 envelope gene sequence. The present results indicated that the miR‐252 of Ae. albopictus could regulate the gene expression of DENV‐2 E protein and may act as a cellular antiviral regulator in Ae. albopictus. J. Med.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a small envelope virus of Flaviviridae that is mainly transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. It can cause dengue fever with mild clinical symptoms or even life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). At present, there are no specific drugs or mature vaccine products to treat DENV. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of important non-coding small molecular RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. It is involved in and regulates a series of important life processes, such as growth and development, cell differentiation, cell apoptosis, anti-virus, and anti-tumor. miRNAs also play important roles in interactions between host and viral genome transcriptomes. Host miRNAs can directly target the genome of the virus or regulate host factors to promote or inhibit virus replication. Understanding the expression and function of miRNAs during infection with DENV and the related signal molecules of the miRNA-mediated regulatory network will provide new insights for the development of miRNA-based therapies.

TI  - piRNA Profiling of Dengue Virus Type 2-Infected Asian Tiger Mosquito and Midgut Tissues
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 10
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a competent vector for the majority of arboviruses. The mosquito innate immune response is a primary determinant for arthropod-borne virus transmission, and the midgut is the first barrier to pathogen transmission. Mosquito antiviral immunity is primarily mediated by the small interfering RNA pathway. However, the roles that the P-element induced wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway play in antiviral immunity in Ae. albopictus and its midgut still need further exploration. This study aimed to explore the profiles of both viral-derived and host-originated piRNAs in the whole body and midgut infected with Dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) in Ae. albopictus, and to elucidate gene expression profile differences of the PIWI protein family between adult females and their midguts. A deep sequencing-based method was used to identify and analyze small non-coding RNAs, especially the piRNA profiles in DENV-2-infected Ae. albopictus and its midgut. The top-ranked, differentially-expressed piRNAs were further validated using Stem-loop qRT-PCR. Bioinformatics analyses and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) methods were used to detect PIWI protein family members, and their expression profiles. DENV-2 derived piRNAs (vpiRNA, 24–30 nts) were observed in both infected Ae. albopictus and its midgut; however, only vpiRNA in the whole-body library had a weak preference for adenine at position 10 (10A) in the sense molecules as a feature of secondary piRNA. These vpiRNAs were not equally distributed, instead they were derived from a few specific regions of the genome, especially several hot spots, and displayed an obvious positive strand bias. We refer to the differentially expressed host piRNAs after DENV infection as virus-induced host endogenous piRNAs (vepiRNAs). However, we found that vepiRNAs were abundant in mosquito whole-body tissue, but deficient in the midgut. A total of eleven PIWI family genes were identified in Ae. albopictus; however, only AalPiwi5–7 and AalAgo3(1–2) were readily detected in the midgut. The characteristics of piRNAs in DENV-2-infected Ae. albopictus adult females were similar to those previously described for flavivirus infections but were not observed in the midgut. The reduced levels of vepiRNAs and incomplete expression of PIWI pathway genes in midgut samples from DENV-2-infected Ae. albopictus suggests that viral regulation of host piRNAs may not be an important factor in the midgut.

TI  - α-Glucosidase Inhibitors Reduce Dengue Virus Production by Affecting the Initial Steps of Virion Morphogenesis in the Endoplasmic Reticulum

AB  - ABSTRACT We report that endoplasmic reticulum α-glucosidase inhibitors have antiviral effects on dengue (DEN) virus. We found that glucosidase inhibition strongly affects productive folding pathways of the envelope glycoproteins prM (the intracellular glycosylated precursor of M [membrane protein]) and E (envelope protein): the proper folding of prM bearing unprocessed N-linked oligosaccharide is inefficient, and this causes delayed formation of prME heterodimer. The complexes formed between incompletely folded prM and E appear to be unstable, leading to a nonproductive pathway. Inhibition of α-glucosidase-mediated N-linked oligosaccharide trimming may thus prevent the assembly of DEN virus by affecting the early stages of envelope glycoprotein processing.
