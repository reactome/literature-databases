TI  - A Review: Understanding Molecular Mechanisms of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement in Viral Infections
JF  - Vaccines
VL  - 11
AB  - Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of an infection has been of interest in the investigation of many viruses. It is associated with the severity of the infection. ADE is mediated by non-neutralizing antibodies, antibodies at sub-neutralizing concentrations, or cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies. Treatments like plasma therapy, B cell immunizations, and antibody therapies may trigger ADE. It is seen as an impediment to vaccine development as well. In viruses including the Dengue virus (DENV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, Zika virus, and influenza virus, the likely mechanisms of ADE are postulated and described. ADE improves the likelihood of productively infecting cells that are expressing the complement receptor or the Fc receptor (FcR) rather than the viral receptors. ADE occurs when the FcR, particularly the Fc gamma receptor, and/or complement system, particularly Complement 1q (C1q), allow the entry of the virus-antibody complex into the cell. Moreover, ADE alters the innate immune pathways to escape from lysis, promoting viral replication inside the cell that produces viral particles. This review discusses the involvement of FcR and the downstream immunomodulatory pathways in ADE, the complement system, and innate antiviral signaling pathways modification in ADE and its impact on facilitating viral replication. Additionally, we have outlined the modes of ADE in the cases of different viruses reported until now.

TI  - Amplificación de la infección dependiente de anticuerpos en la inmunopatogénesis del dengue grave, implicaciones para el desarrollo y uso de las vacunas
JF  - Acta Biológica Colombiana
AB  - Actualmente, la infección por el virus de dengue (DENV) es uno de los problemas más importantes de salud pública en países tropicales y endémicos como Colombia, pues en tanto puede ser producida por cuatro diferentes serotipos virales, durante las infecciones secundarias se presentan frecuentemente cuadros más severos que incluso pueden llevar a desenlaces fatales. El centro de la fisiopatología del dengue grave es el daño producido al endotelio, que se traduce en un aumento en la permeabilidad vascular que se evidencia como fuga plasmática, descontrol en la coagulación y daño de órganos. Aunque hay varias teorías que explican la enfermedad severa, el fenómeno denominado amplificación de la infección dependiente de anticuerpos (antibody dependent enhancement, ADE) es el más conocido. En este, se postula que el virus causante de una infección secundaria es reconocido, pero no neutralizado, por anticuerpos generados en la infección previa e internalizado en las células susceptibles usando receptores Fc-gamma, lo cual aumenta la replicación viral e induce modificaciones en la respuesta inmune celular que contribuyen al desarrollo de dengue grave. En este escrito, se realiza una revisión de los hallazgos sobre los mecanismos involucrados en el fenómeno de ADE y cómo pueden contribuir a la progresión hacia dengue grave, describiendo los conceptos de ADE extrínseco e intrínseco, además de como este fenómeno debe ser tenido en cuenta para el diseño, desarrollo e implementación de una vacuna para dengue, en tanto es capaz de afectar su eficacia y seguridad.

TI  - Anti-Idiotypic Antibodies Specific to prM Monoantibody Prevent Antibody Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 7
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) co-circulates as four serotypes (DENV1-4). Primary infection only leads to self-limited dengue fever. But secondary infection with another serotype carries a higher risk of increased disease severity, causing life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Serotype cross-reactive antibodies facilitate DENV infection in Fc-receptor-bearing cells by promoting virus entry via Fcγ receptors (FcγR), a process known as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). Most studies suggested that enhancing antibodies were mainly specific to the structural premembrane protein (prM) of DENV. However, there is still no effective drugs or vaccines to prevent ADE. In this study, we firstly confirmed that both DENV-2 infected human sera (anti-DENV-2) and DENV-2 prM monoclonal antibody (prM mAb) could significantly enhance DENV-1 infection in K562 cells. Then we developed anti-idiotypic antibodies (prM-AIDs) specific to prM mAb by immunizing of Balb/c mice. Results showed that these polyclonal antibodies can dramatically reduce ADE phenomenon of DENV-1 infection in K562 cells. To further confirm the anti-ADE effect of prM-AIDs in vivo, interferon-α and γ receptor-deficient mice (AG6) were used as the mouse model for DENV infection. We found that administration of DENV-2 prM mAb indeed caused a higher DENV-1 titer as well as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and alaninea minotransferase (ALT) in mice infected with DENV-1, similar to clinical ADE symptoms. But when we supplemented prM-AIDs to DENV-1 challenged AG6 mice, the viral titer, IL-10 and ALT were obviously decreased to the negative control level. Of note, the number of platelets in peripheral blood of prM-AIDs group were significantly increased at day 3 post infection with DENV-1 compared that of prM-mAb group. These results confirmed that our prM-AIDs could prevent ADE not only in vitro but also in vivo, suggested that anti-idiotypic antibodies might be a new choice to be considered to treat DENV infection.

TI  - Anti-Prm Antibody as an Autoantibody in Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - American Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 4
SP  - 60
EP  - 68
AB  - We have reported that anti-prM antibody is an enhancing antibody that enhances DV infection of non-Fc receptor bearing cells by dual specificity. We identified the epitope recognized by this anti-prM antibody, M3, which is located at the a.a.53-67of the prM protein nearby the prM/M cleavage junction and these anti-M3 antibodies could be detected in dengue patients sera. Surprisingly, this anti-prM antibody not only recognizes the prM protein of dengue virions, but also cross-reacts with epithelial cells, endothelial cells as well as T cells. The binding of anti-prM antibody to endothelial cells was dose-dependent and could be blocked by M3 peptides. Human M3-specific antibodies from dengue patient sera were demonstrated to be able to bind to endothelial cells and mediate ADE infection on K562 cells. Furthermore, the anti-prM antibody will mediate the antibody - dependent cell phagocytosis, leading to the similar severe form of DHF/DSS. In conclusion, anti-prM antibody plays two roles in the pathogenesis of dengue virus infection: to be an enhancing antibody and an autoantibody as well.

TI  - Anti-platelet and anti-endothelial cell autoantibodies in Vietnamese infants and children with dengue hemorrhagic fever
JF  - American Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 4
SP  - 41
EP  - 49
AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a serious public health problem. Increased vascular permeability and thrombocytopenia are the hallmarks of DHF. The mechanisms involved in DHF/Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) pathogenesis is not fully understood. This study gives evidence of the presence of antibodies which cross-reacted with platelets, and endothelial cells in the sera of Vietnamese infants and children with DHF/DSS. The anti-platelet, anti-endothelial cell IgM levels were higher in the sera of DHF/DSS infants and children, compared with controls. However, the levels of these autoantibodies were not correlated with the severity of DHF (non-shock DHF vs DSS). The antiplatelet, and anti-endothelial cell autoantibodies may play a role in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS in infants and children with predominantly primary, and secondary dengue infections, respectively. The epitopes shared by surface molecules of platelets and endothelial cells and dengue virus antigens need to be identified and avoided in designing the safe candidate vaccines.

TI  - Antibodies from dengue patient sera cross‐react with endothelial cells and induce damage
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 69
AB  - Dengue virus infection causes a wide range of diseases from the mild febrile illness dengue fever to the life‐threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Vascular leakage and hemorrhagic syndrome are the clinical features associated with dengue infection, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the cross‐reactivity of dengue patient sera with endothelial cells was demonstrated. There were higher percentages of endothelial cells reactive with dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome patient sera than those with dengue fever patient sera. The percentages of endothelial cells reactive with patient serum IgM were higher than those with IgG. Further studies showed that the endothelial cell binding activity was inhibited by pretreatment with dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). The antibodies against NS1 produced after dengue virus infection may, at least in part, account for the cross‐reactivity of patient sera with endothelial cells. Furthermore, dengue patient sera induced endothelial cell apoptosis via a caspase‐dependent pathway that was also inhibited by NS1 pretreatment. In addition to apoptosis, patient sera caused cell lysis in the presence of complement, and DHF/DSS patient sera showed higher percentages of cytotoxicity than dengue fever patient sera. Thus, the generation of cross‐reactive autoantibodies against endothelial cells would lead to their dysfunction, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of dengue virus infection. J. Med.

TI  - Antibody-Dependent Enhancement Infection Facilitates Dengue Virus-Regulated Signaling of IL-10 Production in Monocytes
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 8
AB  - Background Interleukin (IL)-10 levels are increased in dengue virus (DENV)-infected patients with severe disorders. A hypothetical intrinsic pathway has been proposed for the IL-10 response during antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DENV infection; however, the mechanisms of IL-10 regulation remain unclear. Principle Finding We found that DENV infection and/or attachment was sufficient to induce increased expression of IL-10 and its downstream regulator suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 in human monocytic THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes. IL-10 production was controlled by activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB), primarily through protein kinase A (PKA)- and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/PKB-regulated pathways, with PKA activation acting upstream of PI3K/PKB. DENV infection also caused glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β inactivation in a PKA/PI3K/PKB-regulated manner, and inhibition of GSK-3β significantly increased DENV-induced IL-10 production following CREB activation. Pharmacological inhibition of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) activity significantly decreased DENV-induced IL-10 production, whereas silencing Syk-associated C-type lectin domain family 5 member A caused a partial inhibition. ADE of DENV infection greatly increased IL-10 expression by enhancing Syk-regulated PI3K/PKB/GSK-3β/CREB signaling. We also found that viral load, but not serotype, affected the IL-10 response. Finally, modulation of IL-10 expression could affect DENV replication. Significance These results demonstrate that, in monocytes, IL-10 production is regulated by ADE through both an extrinsic and an intrinsic pathway, all involving a Syk-regulated PI3K/PKB/GSK-3β/CREB pathway, and both of which impact viral replication.

TI  - Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Virus Infection in Primary Human Macrophages; Balancing Higher Fusion against Antiviral Responses
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 6
AB  - The dogma is that the human immune system protects us against pathogens. Yet, several viruses, like dengue virus, antagonize the hosts’ antibodies to enhance their viral load and disease severity; a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. This study offers novel insights in the molecular mechanism of antibody-mediated enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus infection in primary human macrophages. No differences were observed in the number of bound and internalized DENV particles following infection in the absence and presence of enhancing concentrations of antibodies. Yet, we did find an increase in membrane fusion activity during ADE of DENV infection. The higher fusion activity is coupled to a low antiviral response early in infection and subsequently a higher infection efficiency. Apparently, subtle enhancements early in the viral life cycle cascades into strong effects on infection, virus production and immune response. Importantly and in contrast to other studies, the antibody-opsonized virus particles do not trigger immune suppression and remain sensitive to interferon. Additionally, this study gives insight in how human macrophages interact and respond to viral infections and the tight regulation thereof under various conditions of infection.

TI  - Antibody-Dependent Enhancement: A Challenge for Developing a Safe Dengue Vaccine
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - In 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration accorded restricted approval to Sanofi Pasteur's Dengvaxia, a live attenuated vaccine (LAV) for dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease, caused by four antigenically distinct dengue virus serotypes (DENV 1-4). The reason for this limited approval is the concern that this vaccine sensitized some of the dengue-naïve recipients to severe dengue fever. Recent knowledge about the nature of the immune response elicited by DENV viruses suggests that all LAVs have inherent capacity to predominantly elicit antibodies (Abs) against the pre-membrane (prM) and fusion loop epitope (FLE) of DENV. These antibodies are generally cross-reactive among DENV serotypes carrying a higher risk of promoting Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). ADE is a phenomenon in which suboptimal neutralizing or non-neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies bind to virus and facilitate Fcγ receptor mediated enhanced entry into host cells, followed by its replication, and thus increasing the cellular viral load. On the other hand, antibody responses directed against the host-cell receptor binding domain of DENV envelope domain-III (EDIII), exhibit a higher degree of type-specificity with lower potential of ADE. The challenges associated with whole DENV-based vaccine strategies necessitate re-focusing our attention toward the designed dengue vaccine candidates, capable of inducing predominantly type-specific immune responses. If the designed vaccines elicited predominantly EDIII-directed serotype specific antibodies in the absence of prM and FLE antibodies, this could avoid the ADE phenomenon largely associated with the prM and FLE antibodies. The generation of type-specific antibodies to each of the four DENV serotypes by the designed vaccines could avoid the immune evasion mechanisms of DENVs. For the enhanced vaccine safety, all dengue vaccine candidates should be assessed for the extent of type-specific (minimal ADE) vs. cross-reactive (ADE promoting) neutralizing antibodies. The type-specific EDIII antibodies may be more directly related to protection from disease in the absence of ADE promoted by the cross-reactive antibodies.

EP  - 51
AB  - Serum specimens collected during a prospective study of dengue infections among schoolchildren in Bangkok were tested for their ability to enhance dengue 2 (DEN-2) virus growth in human monocytes in vitro. Two groups of dengue-immune sera were compared: 32 dengue antibody positive serum specimens from children who subsequently developed asymptomatic secondary dengue infections; and 9 dengue antibody positive serum specimens from children who subsequently developed severe symptomatic secondary dengue infections, 8 of which were clinically diagnosed as dengue hemorrhagic fever. Antibody-dependent enhancement of virus growth was quantitated by measurement of virus yields in supernatant fluids of normal human monocyte cultures that were infected with DEN-2 virus in the presence of undiluted test serum. Only 4 of 32 (12%) preinfection sera from asymptomatic children, but 6 of 9 (67%) preinfection sera from symptomatic children, had significant enhancing activity (P less than 0.001). High serum DEN-2 antibody dependent enhancing activity is a significant (relative risk = 6.2) risk factor for severe illness among children in a dengue hemorrhagic fever endemic region. Dengue antibodies can be neutralizing and therefore protective, or they can be enhancing and increase the risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever.

TI  - Antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection in U937 cells requires cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 91 Pt 2
SP  - 394
EP  - 403
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue fever and the more severe forms of the infection known as dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Secondary infections with a serotype different from the primary infection are considered a risk factor for the development of DHF/DSS. One explanation for the increased risk of DHF/DSS development after heterologous secondary infections is the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) hypothesis. This hypothesis postulates that pre-existing non-neutralizing antibodies will form immune complexes with the new serotype-infecting virus that in turn will have enhanced capacity to infect macrophages and other Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR)-bearing cells. Despite the evidence supporting the ADE hypothesis, the molecular mechanisms of ADE are not fully understood. In this work, we present evidence which indicates that intact lipid rafts are required for the ADE infection of U937 cells with DENV. Flow cytometry analysis to measure the percentage of infected cells showed that treatment of differentiated U937 cells with nystatin (30 microg ml(-1)), filipin (10 microg ml(-1)) or beta-methyl cyclodextrin (30 mM) significantly reduces (P<0.05) the ADE of DENV-4 infection in vitro without any effect on viability or the number of FcgammaR-bearing cells. Later cholesterol replenishment by supplementing treated cell cultures with bovine fetal serum for 24 h re-established lipid raft integrity and reversed the alteration of the ADE in vitro (P<0.05). Our results suggest that ADE of U937 infection by DENV requires the presence of cholesterol and cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains.

TI  - Antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection inhibits RLR-mediated Type-I IFN-independent signalling through upregulation of cellular autophagy
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 6
AB  - Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus (DENV) infection is identified as the main risk factor of severe Dengue diseases. Through opsonization by subneutralizing or non-neutralizing antibodies, DENV infection suppresses innate cell immunity to facilitate viral replication. However, it is largely unknown whether suppression of type-I IFN is necessary for a successful ADE infection. Here, we report that both DENV and DENV-ADE infection induce an early ISG (NOS2) expression through RLR-MAVS signalling axis independent of the IFNs signaling. Besides, DENV-ADE suppress this early antiviral response through increased autophagy formation rather than induction of IL-10 secretion. The early induced autophagic proteins ATG5-ATG12 participate in suppression of MAVS mediated ISGs induction. Our findings suggest a mechanism for DENV to evade the early antiviral response before IFN signalling activation. Altogether, these results add knowledge about the complexity of ADE infection and contribute further to research on therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection mediated by bispecific antibodies against cell surface molecules other than Fc gamma receptors.
JF  - Journal of immunology
VL  - 147 9
SP  - 3139
EP  - 44
AB  - It is known that antibodies to dengue viruses at subneutralizing concentrations enhance dengue virus infection of Fc gamma R+ cells. This phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) occurs when virus-antibody complexes bind to the Fc gamma R via the Fc portion of the Ig. It has been hypothesized that ADE may be responsible for the pathogenesis of the severe manifestations of dengue virus infection including dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. To further analyze the mechanisms of ADE, we prepared bispecific antibodies by chemically cross-linking antidengue virus antibodies to antibodies specific for Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII and the non-Fc R molecules beta2 microglobulin, CD15 or CD33 and examined whether these bispecific antibodies could enhance infection. Bispecific antibodies targeting dengue virus to Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII enhanced dengue virus infection, consistent with previous reports using conventional antibodies. Furthermore, bispecific antibodies targeting dengue virus to beta2 microglobulin, CD15 or CD33 also enhanced dengue virus infection. Bispecific antibody mediated ADE was inhibited by pretreating the cells with the appropriate blocking mAb. These results indicate that cell surface molecules other than Fc gamma R can mediate ADE and suggest that the Fc gamma R does not provide a unique signal necessary for enhanced infection. We hypothesize that directing dengue virus to the cell surface by a bispecific antibody facilitates the interaction between dengue virus and its receptor, thereby increasing its infectivity.

VL  - 358

EP  - 932
AB  - Too much or too little—better than some Dengue fever is caused by a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus resembling Zika virus. Both viruses can cause severe diseases in humans with catastrophic sequelae. It has been suspected in humans, and shown in animal models, that the host's immune responses can make disease worse. Katzelnick et al. examined data from a long-term study of Nicaraguan children exposed to dengue virus (see the Perspective by Feinberg and Ahmed). They confirmed that antibody-dependent enhancement of disease occurs at a specific range of antibody concentrations. Low levels of antibody did not enhance disease, intermediate levels exacerbated disease, and high antibody titers protected against severe disease. These findings have major implications for vaccines against flaviviruses. Indeed, recent vaccine trials have shown evidence of severe disease in some recipients who were previously exposed to virus. Science, this issue p. 929; see also p. 865 A long-term Nicaraguan pediatric cohort reveals that a narrow range of preexisting antibody titers increases the risk of severe dengue disease. For dengue viruses 1 to 4 (DENV1-4), a specific range of antibody titer has been shown to enhance viral replication in vitro and severe disease in animal models. Although suspected, such antibody-dependent enhancement of severe disease has not been shown to occur in humans. Using multiple statistical approaches to study a long-term pediatric cohort in Nicaragua, we show that risk of severe dengue disease is highest within a narrow range of preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers. By contrast, we observe protection from all symptomatic dengue disease at high antibody titers. Thus, immune correlates of severe dengue must be evaluated separately from correlates of protection against symptomatic disease. These results have implications for studies of dengue pathogenesis and for vaccine development, because enhancement, not just lack of protection, is of concern.

TI  - Antiplatelet autoantibodies elicited by dengue virus non‐structural protein 1 cause thrombocytopenia and mortality in mice
JF  - Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis
VL  - 5
AB  - Background: The mechanisms responsible for thrombocytopenia associated with dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhage fever (DHF) remain unclear. Objective: In this study, we investigated the pathogenic effects of dengue virus (DENV) non‐structural protein 1 (NS1) on the elicitation of platelet cross‐reactive antibodies. Results: The results showed that anti‐DENV NS1 immunoglobulins (Igs) derived from both patients with DF/DHF and recombinant NS1‐immunized rabbits could opsonize normal human platelets and enhance platelet–macrophage engagements in vitro. In addition, treatments with anti‐NS1 Igs abnormally activated human platelets and induced thrombocytopenia in mice. These prothrombotic characteristics of anti‐NS1 Ig might increase the disease burden of coagulant‐aberrant DHF patients. To test this hypothesis, we injected anti‐NS1 Igs into C57BL/6J mice that were preconditioned into a hypercoagulable state by warfarin treatments. When given before but not after platelet‐lysate pre‐adsorption, the anti‐NS1 Igs injection treatments significantly increased mortality, fibrin deposition in lung, and plasma D‐dimer levels, but significantly decreased anticoagulant proteins C, protein S and antithrombin III. Conclusions: These results suggest that the platelet‐bound antibody fractions of anti‐NS1 Ig are prothrombotic, which might exacerbate the severity of disease in hosts with an imbalanced coagulant system.

TI  - Association Between a History of Dengue Fever and the Risk of Systemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases: A Nationwide, Population-Based Case-Control Study
JF  - Frontiers in Medicine
VL  - 8
AB  - Purpose: To determine the association between a history of clinically diagnosed dengue infection and the risk of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs). Methods: Using claims data from the 1997–2013 Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database, we included 74,422 patients who were diagnosed with SARDs and 297,688 patients without SARDs who were matched (in a 1:4 ratio) for age, sex, year of SARDs index date, and city of residence. The associations between the development of SARDs and a history of dengue infection (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 061) were investigated using conditional logistic regression analysis shown as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjusting for potential confounders. Results: We included 17,126 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 15,531 patients with Sjogren's syndrome (SS), 37,685 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 1,911 patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), 1,277 patients with dermatomyositis (DM), and 892 patients with polymyositis (PM). SLE (OR, 4.55; 95% CI, 2.77–7.46; p <0.001) risk was significantly associated with a history of dengue infection. However, no statistically significant association was found between dengue infection and SS (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.88–2.26; p = 0.155), RA (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.70–1.50; p = 0.888), SSc (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 0.38–10.29; p = 0.420), DM (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.04–7.27; p = 0.641), or PM (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 0.23–18.79; p = 0.513). Conclusion: This study revealed that a history of dengue infection was significantly associated with the risk of SLE, but not SS, RA, SSc, DM, or PM.

TI  - Autoantibody Profiling in Plasma of Dengue Virus–Infected Individuals
JF  - Pathogens
VL  - 9
AB  - Dengue is an arboviral disease caused by dengue virus (DENV) with high prevalence in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Autoimmune syndromes following dengue can be observed in long term follow up. Anti-DENV antibodies are cross-reactive with surface antigens on endothelial cells or platelets and could be involved in the pathogenesis of dengue. However, no studies have analyzed the autoantibody repertoire and its roles in dengue pathogenesis. Hence, we aimed to describe the autoantibody profile in dengue patients with different disease severities. We utilized a protein array with 128 putative autoantigens to screen for IgM and IgG reactivity in plasma obtained from healthy donors (n = 8), asymptomatic individuals infected with DENV (n = 11) and hospitalized dengue patients (n = 21). Even though the patient cohort is small, we show that 80 IgM and 6 IgG autoantibodies were elevated in DENV infected patients compared to age-matched healthy donors. Individuals undergoing a primary DENV infection showed higher amounts of IgG autoantibodies, not IgM autoantibodies, compared to individuals undergoing secondary infection. No differences were observed between asymptomatic and hospitalized dengue patients. Nineteen autoantibodies, which react against several coagulation and complement components, correlated with platelet counts in severe dengue patients. This current study provides a framework to explore a possible role of candidate autoantibodies in dengue immunopathogenesis.

VL  - 19 2
SP  - 127
EP  - 32
AB  - The pathogenic mechanisms of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) caused by dengue virus (DV) infection remain unresolved. Patients with DHF/DSS are characterized by several manifestations, including severe thrombocytopenia, vascular leakage, and hepatomegaly. In addition to the effect of virus load and virus variation, abnormal immune responses of the host after DV infection may also account for the progression of DHF/DSS. Actually, viral autoimmunity is involved in the pathogenesis of numerous viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus, human hepatitis C virus, human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein- Barr virus, and DV. In this review, we discuss the implications of autoimmunity in dengue pathogenesis. Antibodies directed against DV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) showed cross-reactivity with human platelets and endothelial cells, which lead to platelet and endothelial cell damage and inflammatory activation. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that anti-DV NS1 is involved in the pathogenesis of DF and DHF/DSS, and this may provide important information in dengue vaccine development.

TI  - Autophagy Facilitates Antibody-Enhanced Dengue Virus Infection in Human Pre-Basophil/Mast Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - Background Dengue virus (DENV) infection can cause severe hemorrhagic disease in humans. Although the pathogenic mechanisms underlying severe DENV disease remain unclear, one of the possible contributing factors is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) which occurs when sub-neutralizing antibodies derived from a previous DENV infection enhance viral infection through interaction between virus-antibody complexes and FcR-bearing cells, such as macrophages and basophil/mast cells. Although recent reports showed that DENV induces autophagy, the relationship between antibody-enhanced DENV infection and autophagy is not clear. Methodology/Principal Findings We showed that sub-neutralizing antibodies derived from dengue patient sera enhanced DENV infection and autophagy in the KU812 pre-basophil-like cell line as well as the HMC-1 immature mast cell line. Antibody-enhanced DENV infection of KU812 cells increased the number of autophagosome vesicles, LC3 punctation, LC3-II accumulation, and p62 degradation over that seen in cells infected with DENV alone. The percentages of DENV envelope (E) protein-positive cells and LC3 puncta following antibody-enhanced DENV infection of KU812 cells were reduced by the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. Antibody-enhanced DENV infection of HMC-1 cells showed co-localization of DENV E protein and dsRNA with autophagosomes, which was inhibited by 3-MA treatment. Furthermore, DENV infection and replication were reduced when KU812 cells were transfected with the autophagy-inhibiting Atg4BC74A mutant. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate a significant induction of autophagy in antibody-enhanced DENV infection of pre-basophil-like KU812 and immature mast cell-like HMC-1 cells. Also, autophagy plays an important role in DENV infection and replication in these cells. Given the importance of ADE and FcR-bearing cells such as monocytes, macrophages and basophil/mast cells in dengue disease, the results provide insights into dengue pathogenesis and therapeutic means of control.

TI  - B cell receptor dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 20
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue, a mosquito-borne disease that represents a significant and growing public health burden around the world. A unique pathophysiological feature of dengue is immune-mediated enhancement, wherein preexisting immunity elicited by a primary infection can enhance the severity of a subsequent infection by a heterologous DENV serotype. A leading mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), where sub-neutralizing concentrations of DENV-specific IgG antibodies facilitate entry of DENV into FcγR expressing cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Accordingly, this model posits that phagocytic mononuclear cells are the primary reservoir of DENV. However, analysis of samples from individuals experiencing acute DENV infection reveals that B cells are the largest reservoir of infected circulating cells, representing a disconnect in our understanding of immune-mediated DENV tropism. In this study, we demonstrate that the expression of a DENV-specific B cell receptor (BCR) renders cells highly susceptible to DENV infection, with the infection-enhancing activity of the membrane-restricted BCR correlating with the ADE potential of the IgG version of the antibody. In addition, we observed that the frequency of DENV-infectable B cells increases in previously flavivirus-naïve volunteers after a primary DENV infection. These findings suggest that BCR-dependent infection of B cells is a novel mechanism immune-mediated enhancement of DENV-infection.

JF  - American Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 4
SP  - 85
EP  - 91
AB  - Infection with dengue virus (DV) causes diseases ranging from self-limited dengue fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Vascular leakage, thrombocytopenia and bleeding are the clinical manifestations associated with dengue hemorrhage. We previously showed that anti-DV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antibodies (Abs) cross-reacted with endothelial cells. The potential target proteins on endothelial cell surface recognized by anti-DV NS1 Abs showed sequence homology with the C-terminal amino acids (a.a.) 311-352 of DV NS1. In this study, the role of NS1 C-terminal region in dengue autoimmunity was investigated. We deleted the a.a. 277-352 of DV NS1 to prepare truncated NS1 (tNS1) and generated anti-DV tNS1 Abs in mice. The endothelial cell-binding activity of anti-DV tNS1 Abs was lower than that of anti-DV NS1 Abs. In addition, the endothelial cell-binding activity of anti-DV NS1 Abs was inhibited by preabsorption with DV NS1 but not with DV tNS1 proteins. The anti-P311 (a.a. 311-330) and anti-P331 (a.a. 331-350) titers of dengue patient sera were positively correlated with their endothelial cell-binding activity. Dengue patient sera showed lower binding activity to DV tNS1 than to DV NS1 proteins. The endothelial cell-binding activity of dengue patient sera was inhibited by preabsorption with P311 and P331. This study helps to understand the molecular mechanisms of autoimmunity mediated by anti-DV NS1 Abs and to provide the potential implications of tNS1 in dengue vaccine strategies.

TI  - CD8+ T Cells Prevent Antigen-Induced Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Disease in Mice
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 193
SP  - 4117
EP  - 4124
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) causes pathologies ranging from the febrile illness dengue fever to the potentially lethal severe dengue disease. A major risk factor for developing severe dengue disease is the presence of subprotective DENV-reactive Abs from a previous infection (or from an immune mother), which can induce Ab-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE). However, infection in the presence of subprotective anti–DENV Abs does not always result in severe disease, suggesting that other factors influence disease severity. In this study we investigated how CD8+ T cell responses influence the outcome of Ab-mediated severe dengue disease. Mice were primed with aluminum hydroxide–adjuvanted UV-inactivated DENV prior to challenge with DENV. Priming failed to induce robust CD8+ T cell responses, and it induced nonneutralizing Ab responses that increased disease severity upon infection. Transfer of exogenous DENV-activated CD8+ T cells into primed mice prior to infection prevented Ab-dependent enhancement and dramatically reduced viral load. Our results suggest that in the presence of subprotective anti–DENV Abs, efficient CD8+ T cell responses reduce the risk of Ab-mediated severe dengue disease.

JF  - Journal of Virology

EP  - 1683
AB  - ABSTRACT Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is implicated in severe, usually secondary, dengue virus (DV) infections. Preexisting heterotypic antibodies, via their Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR) interactions, may increase disease severity through enhanced target cell infection. Greater numbers of infected target cells may contribute to higher viremia and excess cytokine levels often observed in severe disease. Monocytes, macrophages, and immature and mature dendritic cells (DC) are considered major cellular targets of DV. Apheresis of multiple donors allowed isolation of autologous primary myeloid target cell types for head-to-head comparison of infection rates, viral output, and cytokine production under direct infection (without antibody) or ADE conditions (with antibody). All studied cell types except immature DC supported ADE. All cells undergoing ADE secreted proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]) at enhancement titers, but distinct cell-type-specific patterns were observed for other relevant proteins (alpha/beta interferon [IFN-α/β] and IL-10). Macrophages produced type I interferons (IFN-α/β) that were modulated by ADE. Mature DC mainly secreted IFN-β. Interestingly, only monocytes secreted IL-10, and only upon antibody-enhanced infection. While ADE infection rates were remarkably consistent in monocytes (10 to 15%) across donors, IL-10 protein levels varied according to previously described regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-10 promoter region. The homozygous GCC haplotype was associated with high-level IL-10 secretion, while the ACC and ATA haplotypes produced intermediate and low levels of IL-10, respectively. Our data suggest that ADE effects are cell type specific, are influenced by host genetics, and, depending on relative infection rates, may further contribute to the complexity of DV pathogenesis.

AB  - Dengue fever is gaining increased attention as a major global health problem. It occurs annually in 50–100 million people in more than 100 countries, and places half a million people at risk of life-threatening diseases: dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). The pathogenic mechanisms causing DHF/DSS are not clearly understood. This article reviews cellular and molecular mechanisms that might be responsible for the initiation of the pathogenic processes, including hypotheses for DHF/DSS, dengue-permissive target cells, putative dengue receptors, neutralizing and enhancing antibodies to dengue virus, mechanisms of vascular plasma leakage, innate immune response in dengue infection and antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue infection. While reviewing the literature, the article also gives the author’s opinion on perceived areas of importance for future research in human dengue pathogenesis.

TI  - Conventional and antibody-enhanced DENV infection of human macrophages induces differential immunotranscriptomic profiles
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 99
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which coexists as four genetically and immunologically distinct serotypes (DENV-1 to -4). In secondary heterologous DENV infection, pre-existing immunity is believed to contribute to severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Although the elevated pathology observed in ADE conditions has been described, the cell-intrinsic mechanisms governing this process remain unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages infected by DENV-2 in ADE compared to conventional infection conditions. Unsupervised analysis of scRNAseq data enabled the identification of two distinct cell populations in a heterogeneous cell culture, likely representing infected and bystander/uninfected cells. Differential gene expression and ingenuity pathway analyses revealed a number of significantly upregulated and downregulated genes and gene networks between cells infected by ADE compared to conventional infection. Specifically, these pathways indicated mechanisms such as suppressed interferon signaling and inflammatory chemokine transcription in cells infected via ADE. Further analysis revealed that transcriptomic changes were independent of viral RNA within infected cells, suggesting that the observed changes are reflective of cell-intrinsic responses and not simply a function of per-cell viral burden. The interpreted “bystander” cell population also demonstrated distinct profiles in ADE conditions, indicating an immunologically activated phenotype enriched for the expression of gene networks involved with protein translation, cytokine production, and antigen presentation. Together, these findings support the concept that DENV infection via ADE induces a qualitatively different transcriptomic response in infected cells, contributing to our understanding of ADE as a mechanistic driver of disease and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne human pathogen with a significant and growing global health burden. Although correlates of severe dengue disease are poorly understood, pre-existing immunity to DENV has been associated with severe disease risk and known to contribute to an alternative route of viral entry termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct transcriptomic processes involved in antibody-mediated DENV entry compared to conventional receptor-mediated entry. These data provide meaningful insight into the discrete processes contributing to DENV pathogenesis in ADE conditions.

TI  - Correlation between serum levels of anti-endothelial cell autoantigen and anti-dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 antibodies in dengue patients.
JF  - The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene
VL  - 92 5
SP  - 989
EP  - 95
AB  - We have previously shown that anti-dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (anti-DENV NS1) antibodies cross-react with endothelial cells, and several autoantigens have been identified. This study shows that the antibody levels against these self-proteins are higher in sera from patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) than those in control sera. Anti-protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and anti-heat shock protein 60 (anti-HSP60) IgM levels correlated with both anti-endothelial cells and anti-DENV NS1 IgM titers. A cross-reactive epitope on the NS1 amino acid residues 311-330 (P311-330) had been predicted. We further found that there were higher IgM and IgG levels against P311-330 in DHF patients' sera than those in the control sera. In addition, correlations were observed between anti-PDI with anti-P311-330 IgM and IgG levels, respectively. Therefore, our results indicate that DENV NS1 P311-330 is a major epitope for cross-reactive antibodies to PDI on the endothelial cell surface, which may play an important role in DENV infection-induced autoimmunity.

JF  - FEMS immunology and medical microbiology

EP  - 6
AB  - During dengue virus infection a unique cytokine, cytotoxic factor (hCF), is produced that is pathogenesis-related and plays a key role in the development of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). However, what regulates the adverse effects of hCF is not known. We have previously shown that anti-hCF antibodies raised in mice, neutralise the pathogenic effects of hCF. In this study we have investigated the presence and levels of hCF-autoantibodies in sera of patients with various severity of dengue illness (n=136) and normal healthy controls (n=50). The highest levels of hCF-autoantibodies (mean+/-S.D.=36+/-20 U ml(-1)) were seen in patients with mild illness, the dengue fever (DF), and 48 out of 50 (96%) of the sera were positive. On the other hand the hCF-autoantibody levels declined sharply with the development of DHF and the levels were lowest in patients with DHF grade IV (mean+/-S.D.=5+/-2 U ml(-1); P=<0.001 as compared to DF). Only one of the 13 DHF grade IV patients had an antibody level above the 'cut-off' value (mean plus 3 S.D. of the control sera). The analysis of data with respect to different days of illness further showed that the highest levels of hCF-autoantibodies were present in DF patients at >9 days of illness. Moreover, the DF patients at all time points, i.e. 1-4, 5-8 and >9 days of illness had significantly higher levels of hCF-autoantibodies (P<0.001) than patients with DHF grade I, II, III and IV. In addition DHF grade I and grade II patients had significantly more positive specimens than DHF grade III and grade IV patients at all time points. These results suggest that elevated levels of hCF-autoantibodies protect the patients against the development of severe forms of DHF and, therefore, it may be useful as a prognostic indicator.

TI  - DENV-specific IgA contributes protective and non-pathologic function during antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection
JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 19
AB  - Dengue represents a growing public health burden worldwide, accounting for approximately 100 million symptomatic cases and tens of thousands of fatalities yearly. Prior infection with one serotype of dengue virus (DENV) is the greatest known risk factor for severe disease upon secondary infection with a heterologous serotype, a risk which increases as serotypes co-circulate in endemic regions. This disease risk is thought to be mediated by IgG-isotype antibodies raised during a primary infection, which poorly neutralize heterologous DENV serotypes and instead opsonize virions for uptake by FcγR-bearing cells. This antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection leads to a larger proportion of susceptible cells infected, higher viremia and greater immunopathology. We have previously characterized the induction of a serum IgA response, along with the typical IgM and IgG responses, during dengue infection, and have shown that DENV-reactive IgA can neutralize DENV and competitively antagonize IgG-mediated ADE. Here, we evaluate the potential for IgA itself to cause ADE. We show that IgG, but not IgA, mediated ADE of infection in cells expressing both FcαR and FcγRs. IgG-mediated ADE stimulated significantly higher pro-inflammatory cytokine production by primary human macrophages, while IgA did not affect, or slightly suppressed, this production. Mechanistically, we show that DENV/IgG immune complexes bind susceptible cells significantly more efficiently than DENV/IgA complexes or virus alone. Finally, we show that over the course of primary dengue infection, the expression of FcγRI (CD64) increases during the period of acute viremia, while FcγRIIa (CD32) and FcαR (CD89) expression decreases, thereby further limiting the ability of IgA to facilitate ADE in the presence of DENV. Overall, these data illustrate the distinct protective role of IgA during ADE of dengue infection and highlight the potential therapeutic and prognostic value of DENV-specific IgA.

TI  - DNA-immunisation with dengue virus E protein domains I/II, but not domain III, enhances Zika, West Nile and Yellow Fever virus infection
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 12
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), the causative agent of dengue disease, is among the most important mosquito-borne pathogens worldwide. DENV is composed of four closely related serotypes and belongs to the Flaviviridae family alongside other important arthropod-borne viral pathogens such as Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Yellow Fever virus (YFV). After infection, the antibody response is mostly directed to the viral E glycoprotein which is composed of three structural domains named DI, DII and DIII that share variable degrees of homology among different viruses. Recent evidence supports a close serological interaction between ZIKV and DENV. The possibility of worse clinical outcomes as a consequence of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) due to cross-reactive antibodies with poor neutralisation activity is a matter of concern. We tested polyclonal sera from groups of female Balb/C mice vaccinated with DNA constructs expressing DI/DII, DIII or the whole sE from different DENV serotypes and compared their activity in terms of cross-reactivity, neutralisation of virus infection and ADE. Our results indicate that the polyclonal antibody responses against the whole sE protein are highly cross-reactive with strong ADE and poor neutralisation activities due to DI/DII immunodominance. Conversely, anti-DIII polyclonal antibodies are type-specific, with no ADE towards ZIKV, WNV and YFV, and strong neutralisation activity restricted only to DENV.

TI  - Deletion of the C-Terminal Region of Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1 (NS1) Abolishes Anti-NS1-Mediated Platelet Dysfunction and Bleeding Tendency1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 183
SP  - 1797
EP  - 1803
AB  - The mechanisms underlying dengue hemorrhagic disease are incompletely understood. We previously showed that anti-dengue virus (DV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) Abs cross-react with human platelets and inhibit platelet aggregation. Based on sequence homology alignment, the cross-reactive epitopes reside in the C-terminal region of DV NS1. In this study, we compared the effects of Abs against full-length DV NS1 and NS1 lacking the C-terminal aa 271 to 352 (designated ΔC NS1). Anti-ΔC NS1 Abs exhibited lower platelet binding activity than that of anti-full-length NS1. Anti-full-length NS1 but not anti-ΔC NS1 Abs inhibited platelet aggregation, which was shown to involve integrin αIIbβ3 inactivation. We found that the bleeding time in full-length NS1-hyperimmunized mice was longer than that in the normal control mice. By contrast, ΔC NS1-hyperimmunized mice showed a bleeding time similar to that of normal control mice. Passively administered anti-DV NS1, but not anti-ΔC NS1, Ab level decreased markedly in serum and this decrease was correlated with Ab binding to platelets. A transient platelet loss in the circulation was observed after anti-DV NS1, but not anti-ΔC NS1, Ab administration. In summary, platelet dysfunction and bleeding tendency are induced by anti-full-length DV NS1 but not by anti-ΔC NS1 Abs. These findings may be important not only for understanding dengue hemorrhagic disease pathogenesis but also for dengue vaccine development.

AB  - Nineteen monoclonal antibodies produced to dengue type 4 virus (DEN-4) strain 4328-S were tested for their ability to mediate antibody-dependent infection enhancement (ADE) with seven DEN-2 strains in P-388D1 mouse macrophage-like cells. In this first study of the distribution of enhancing epitopes on multiple DEN-2 strains reacted with monoclonal antibodies to a different serotype (DEN-4), DEN-4 monospecific antibodies produced ADE with DEN-2 viruses, indicating the presence of DEN-4-like determinants on DEN-2 viruses. Analysis differentiated at least one and possibly more DEN-2 strain subgroups, one of which (isolates AHF-110 and AHF-191) was previously identified by DEN-2 monoclonal antibody analysis. The study demonstrates the heterogeneous distribution of dengue complex and DEN-4 epitopes on DEN-2 strains. Monoclonal antibodies are valuable tools for study of the biology of ADE and its relation to dengue shock syndrome.

TI  - Dengue Antibody-Dependent Enhancement: Knowns and Unknowns
JF  - Microbiology Spectrum
VL  - 2
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue provides the most abundant example in human medicine and the greatest human illness burden caused by the phenomenon of intrinsic antibody-dependent infection enhancement (iADE). In this immunopathological phenomenon infection of monocytes or macrophages using infectious immune complexes suppresses innate antiviral systems, permitting logarithmic intracellular growth of dengue virus. The four dengue viruses evolved from a common ancestor yet retain similar ecology and pathogenicity, but although infection with one virus provides short-term cross-protection against infection with a different type, millions of secondary dengue infections occur worldwide each year. When individuals are infected in the virtual absence of cross-protective dengue antibodies, the dengue vascular permeability syndrome (DVPS) may ensue. This occurs in around 2 to 4% of second heterotypic dengue infections. A complete understanding of the biologic mechanism of iADE, dengue biology, and the mechanism of host responses to dengue infection should lead to a comprehensive and complete understanding of the pathogenesis of DVPS. A crucial emphasis must be placed on understanding ADE. Clinical and epidemiological observations of DVPS define the research questions and provide research parameters. This article will review knowledge related to dengue ADE and point to areas where there has been little research progress. These observations relate to the two stages of dengue illnesses: afferent phenomena are those that promote the success of the microorganism to infect and survive; efferent phenomena are those mounted by the host to inhibit infection and replication and to eliminate the infectious agent and infected tissues. Data will be discussed as “knowns” and “unknowns.”

TI  - Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1–Induced Antibodies Cross-React with Human Plasminogen and Enhance Its Activation
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 196
SP  - 1218
EP  - 1226
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease, and it can cause life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Abnormal activation of the coagulation and fibrinolysis system is one of the hallmarks of DHF/DSS. However, the mechanism underlying hemorrhage in DHF/DSS remains elusive. In previous studies, plasminogen (Plg) cross-reactive Abs, which can recognize DENV nonstructural protein (NS) 1, have been found in dengue patients. However, it is unclear whether these Abs are indeed induced by DENV NS1. Thus, we immunized mice with recombinant NS1 from both bacteria and drosophila to determine whether NS1 can induce Plg cross-reactive Abs. The results from the NS1-immunized mouse sera indicated that NS1 immunization induced Abs that could cross-react with Plg. To study the effects of these NS1-induced Plg cross-reactive Abs on fibrinolysis, we isolated several Plg cross-reactive anti-NS1 mAbs from these mice and found that some of them could enhance Plg activation. In addition, epitope mapping with a phage-displayed random peptide library revealed that one of these mAbs (2A5) could recognize NS1 C-terminal residues 305–311, which share sequence homology with Plg residues 590–597. A synthetic peptide of NS1 residues 305–311 could inhibit the binding of both 2A5 and its Fab to Plg and its enhanced activation. Thus, our results suggest that DENV NS1 can induce Plg cross-reactive Abs through molecular mimicry, which can enhance Plg activation and may contribute to the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS.

TI  - Dengue Virus prM-Specific Human Monoclonal Antibodies with Virus Replication-Enhancing Properties Recognize a Single Immunodominant Antigenic Site
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 780
EP  - 789
AB  - ABSTRACT The proposed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) mechanism for severe dengue virus (DENV) disease suggests that non-neutralizing serotype cross-reactive antibodies generated during a primary infection facilitate entry into Fc receptor bearing cells during secondary infection, resulting in enhanced viral replication and severe disease. One group of cross-reactive antibodies that contributes considerably to this serum profile target the premembrane (prM) protein. We report here the isolation of a large panel of naturally occurring human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) obtained from subjects following primary DENV serotype 1, 2, or 3 or secondary natural DENV infections or following primary DENV serotype 1 live attenuated virus vaccination to determine the antigenic landscape on the prM protein that is recognized by human antibodies. We isolated 25 prM-reactive human MAbs, encoded by diverse antibody-variable genes. Competition-binding studies revealed that all of the antibodies bound to a single major antigenic site on prM. Alanine scanning-based shotgun mutagenesis epitope mapping studies revealed diverse patterns of fine specificity of various clones, suggesting that different antibodies use varied binding poses to recognize several overlapping epitopes within the immunodominant site. Several of the antibodies interacted with epitopes on both prM and E protein residues. Despite the diverse genetic origins of the antibodies and differences in the fine specificity of their epitopes, each of these prM-reactive antibodies was capable of enhancing the DENV infection of Fc receptor-bearing cells. IMPORTANCE Antibodies may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of enhanced DENV infection and disease during secondary infections. A substantial proportion of enhancing antibodies generated in response to natural dengue infection are directed toward the prM protein. The fine specificity of human prM antibodies is not understood. Here, we isolated a panel of dengue prM-specific human monoclonal antibodies from individuals after infection in order to define the mode of molecular recognition by enhancing antibodies. We found that only a single antibody molecule can be bound to each prM protein at any given time. Distinct overlapping epitopes were mapped, but all of the epitopes lie within a single major antigenic site, suggesting that this antigenic domain forms an immunodominant region of the protein. Neutralization and antibody-dependent enhanced replication experiments showed that recognition of any of the epitopes within the major antigenic site on prM was sufficient to cause enhanced infection of target cells.

TI  - Dengue Virus-Induced Autoantibodies Bind to Plasminogen and Enhance Its Activation
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 187
SP  - 6483
EP  - 6490
AB  - Dengue virus infection can lead to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in patients. Abnormal activation of the coagulation and fibrinolysis system is one of the hallmarks associated with DHF/DSS patients. However, the mechanisms that cause pathology in DHF/DSS patients are still unclear. Because conversion of plasminogen (Plg) to plasmin (Plm) is the first step in the activation of fibrinolysis, Abs against Plg found in DHF/DSS patients may be important. Therefore, to investigate the specificity, function, and possible origin of these Abs, we generated several Plg cross-reactive mAbs from DENV-immunized mice. An IgG mAb, 6H11, which recognizes an epitope associated with a dengue envelope protein, demonstrated a high level of cross-reactivity with Plg. The 6H11 Ab was further characterized with regard to its effect on Plg activation. Using Plm-specific chromogenic substrate S-2251, we found that mAb 6H11 demonstrated serine protease activity and could convert Plg directly to Plm. The serine protease activity of mAb 6H11 was further confirmed using serine protease chromogenic substrate S-2288. In addition, we found several Plg cross-reactive mAbs that could enhance urokinase-induced Plg activation. Lastly, mAb 6H11 could induce Plm activity and increase the level of D-dimer (a fibrin degradation product) in both human and mouse platelet-poor plasma. Taken together, these data suggest DENV-induced Plg cross-reactive Abs may enhance Plg conversion to Plm, which would be expected to contribute to hyperfibrinolysis in DHF/DSS patients.

TI  - Dengue Viruses Are Enhanced by Distinct Populations of Serotype Cross-Reactive Antibodies in Human Immune Sera
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses of global importance. DENV exist as four serotypes, DENV1-DENV4. Following a primary infection, individuals produce DENV-specific antibodies that bind only to the serotype of infection and other antibodies that cross-react with two or more serotypes. People exposed to a secondary DENV infection with another serotype are at greater risk of developing more severe forms of dengue disease. The increased risk of severe dengue in people experiencing repeat DENV infections appear to be due, at least in part, to the ability of pre-existing serotype cross-reactive antibodies to form virus-antibody complexes that can productively infect Fcγ receptor-bearing target cells. While the theory of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is supported by several human and small animal model studies, the specific viral antigens and epitopes recognized by enhancing human antibodies after natural infections have not been fully defined. We used antibody-depletion techniques to remove DENV-specific antibody sub-populations from primary DENV-immune human sera. The effects of removing specific antibody populations on ADE were tested both in vitro using K562 cells and in vivo using the AG129 mouse model. Removal of serotype cross-reactive antibodies ablated enhancement of heterotypic virus infection in vitro and antibody-enhanced mortality in vivo. Further depletion studies using recombinant viral antigens showed that although the removal of DENV E-specific antibodies using recombinant E (rE) protein resulted in a partial reduction in DENV enhancement, there was a significant residual enhancement remaining. Competition ADE studies using prM-specific Fab fragments in human immune sera showed that both rE-specific and prM-specific antibodies in primary DENV-immune sera significantly contribute to enhancement of heterotypic DENV infection in vitro. Identification of the targets of DENV-enhancing antibodies should contribute to the development of safe, non-enhancing vaccines against dengue.

TI  - Dengue immune sera enhance Zika virus infection in human peripheral blood monocytes through Fc gamma receptors
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 13
AB  - Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) has most often been associated with dengue virus (DENV). Studies using leukemia cell lines suggest that DENV specific antibodies can enhance Zika virus (ZIKV) infectivity, and vice versa. To examine the mechanisms of ADE of ZIKV infection in primary human cells, we assessed 40 serum samples obtained from convalescent DENV-1 or DENV-3 infected subjects. All sera tested exhibited high binding potency, while modest or none neutralization activities against ZIKV. Primary CD14+ monocytes, rather than B and T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), were found to be the mediators of the enhancement of ZIKV infectivity by DENV immune sera. Monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (DCs), but not mature DCs were highly permissive to ZIKV infection, whereas neither immature nor mature DCs could mediate enhanced ZIKV infection in the presence of DENV immune sera. In addition, antibody blocking of either FcγRI (CD64), or FcγRII (CD32), or FcγRIII (CD16) resulted in diminished ADE of ZIKV infection. Our findings provide an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection, and inform rational vaccine design.

AB  - The immunopathogenesis of dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome is thought to be mediated by a variety of host factors. Enhancing antibodies are one of the key regulating molecules. These antibodies, via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, are able to facilitate dengue virus (DENV) growth in Fc-bearing host cells. The mechanism of ADE-enhanced DENV production is believed to be mediated through increasing the infected-cell mass. In the present work, the effect of ADE infection was explored further, focusing on the post-entry events of ADE infection. It was hypothesized that the higher virus production in ADE infection compared with DENV infection may be due to the ability of this infection pathway to suppress key antiviral molecules. Therefore, the influence of ADE infection on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-12 (IL-12), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6 and IL-10, was investigated and it was found that DENV infection via the Fc receptor-mediated pathway was able to suppress the transcription and translation of IL-12, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. In contrast, infection via this route facilitated expression and synthesis of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Moreover, this study demonstrates that the ADE infection pathway also suppresses an innate anti-DENV mediator, nitric oxide radicals, by disrupting the transcription of the iNOS gene transcription factor, IRF-1, and blocking the activation of STAT-1. In conclusion, ADE infection not only facilitates the entry process, but also modifies innate and adaptive intracellular antiviral mechanisms, resulting in unrestricted DENV replication in THP-1 cells.

AB  - Summary Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) typically occurs during secondary infections with dengue viruses (DENVs). Although it is generally accepted that antibody-dependent enhancement is the primary reason why patients with secondary infection are at an increased risk of developing DHF, a growing body of evidence shows that other mechanisms, such as the elicitation of antiplatelet autoantibodies by DENV nonstructural protein NS1, also play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of DHF. In this study, we developed a “two-hit” model of secondary DENV infection to examine the respective roles of DENV (first hit) and antiplatelet Igs (second hit) on the induction of haemorrhage. Mice were first exposed to DENV and then exposed to antiplatelet or anti-NS1 Igs 24 hours later. The two-hit treatment induced substantial haemorrhage, coagulopathy, and cytokine surge, and additional treatment with antagonists of TNF-α, IL-1, caspase-1, and FcүRIII ameliorated such effects. In addition, knockout mice lacking the Fcү receptor III, Toll-like receptor 3, and inflammasome components Nlrp3 and caspase-1 exhibited considerably fewer pathological alterations than did wild type controls. These findings may provide new perspectives for developing feasible approaches to treat patients with DHF.

TI  - Dengue virus antibody database: Systematically linking serotype-specificity with epitope mapping in dengue virus
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 11
AB  - Background A majority infections caused by dengue virus (DENV) are asymptomatic, but a higher incidence of severe illness, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever, is associated with secondary infections, suggesting that pre-existing immunity plays a central role in dengue pathogenesis. Primary infections are typically associated with a largely serotype-specific antibody response, while secondary infections show a shift to a broadly cross-reactive antibody response. Methods/Principal findings We hypothesized that the basis for the shift in serotype-specificity between primary and secondary infections can be found in a change in the antibody fine-specificity. To investigate the link between epitope- and serotype-specificity, we assembled the Dengue Virus Antibody Database, an online repository containing over 400 DENV-specific mAbs, each annotated with information on 1) its origin, including the immunogen, host immune history, and selection methods, 2) binding/neutralization data against all four DENV serotypes, and 3) epitope mapping at the domain or residue level to the DENV E protein. We combined epitope mapping and activity information to determine a residue-level index of epitope propensity and cross-reactivity and generated detailed composite epitope maps of primary and secondary antibody responses. We found differing patterns of epitope-specificity between primary and secondary infections, where secondary responses target a distinct subset of epitopes found in the primary response. We found that secondary infections were marked with an enhanced response to cross-reactive epitopes, such as the fusion-loop and E-dimer region, as well as increased cross-reactivity in what are typically more serotype-specific epitope regions, such as the domain I-II interface and domain III. Conclusions/Significance Our results support the theory that pre-existing cross-reactive memory B cells form the basis for the secondary antibody response, resulting in a broadening of the response in terms of cross-reactivity, and a focusing of the response to a subset of epitopes, including some, such as the fusion-loop region, that are implicated in poor neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.

JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 7
AB  - Secondary infection with a heterologous dengue virus (DENV) serotype increases the risk of severe dengue, through a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). During ADE, DENV is opsonized with non- or sub-neutralizing antibody levels that augment entry into monocytes and dendritic cells through Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs). We previously reported that co-ligation of leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor-B1 (LILRB1) by antibody-opsonized DENV led to recruitment of SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) to dephosphorylate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and reduce interferon stimulated gene induction. Here, we show that LILRB1 also signals through SHP-1 to attenuate the otherwise rapid acidification for lysosomal enzyme activation following FcγR-mediated uptake of DENV. Reduced or slower trafficking of antibody-opsonized DENV to lytic phagolysosomal compartments, demonstrates how co-ligation of LILRB1 also permits DENV to overcome a cell-autonomous immune response, enhancing intracellular survival of DENV. Our findings provide insights on how antiviral drugs that modify phagosome acidification should be used for viruses such as DENV.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) was discovered in 1947 and was thought to lead to relatively mild disease. The recent explosive outbreak of ZIKV in South America has led to widespread concern, with reports of neurological sequelae ranging from Guillain Barré syndrome to microcephaly. ZIKV infection has occurred in areas previously exposed to dengue virus (DENV), a flavivirus closely related to ZIKV. Here we investigated the serological cross-reaction between the two viruses. Plasma immune to DENV showed substantial cross-reaction to ZIKV and was able to drive antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of ZIKV infection. Using a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to DENV, we showed that most antibodies that reacted to DENV envelope protein also reacted to ZIKV. Antibodies to linear epitopes, including the immunodominant fusion-loop epitope, were able to bind ZIKV but were unable to neutralize the virus and instead promoted ADE. Our data indicate that immunity to DENV might drive greater ZIKV replication and have clear implications for disease pathogenesis and future vaccine programs for ZIKV and DENV.

JF  - Viral immunology
VL  - 26 3

EP  - 91
AB  - It has been previously shown that anti-dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein NS1 antibodies could act as autoantibodies that direct against one or more of the host's own proteins, which has potential implications for dengue hemorrhagic fever pathogenesis. In the present study, we have employed suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) to identify the differentially expressed genes from human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) in response to anti-dengue virus type 2 NS1 antibodies (anti-DENV2 NS1 Abs). A total of 35 clones from the SSH cDNA library were randomly selected for further analysis using bioinformatics tools after vector screening. After searching for sequence homology in NCBI GenBank database with BLASTN and BLASTX programs, 23 obtained sequences with significant matches (E-values <1×10(-4)) in the SSH library. The predicted genes in the subtracted library include immune response molecules (CD59 antigen preproprotein preproprotein, MURR1), signal transduction molecules (Nuclear casein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase substrate 1), calcium-binding proteins (S100A6, Annexin A2 isoform 1/2), and cell-membrane component (Yip1 domain family). From these clones, 5 upregulated genes were selected for differential expression profiling by real-time RT-PCR to confirm their upregulated status. The results confirmed their differential upregulation, and thus verified the success of SSHs and the likely involvement of these genes in dengue pathogenesis.

TI  - Does prior dengue virus exposure worsen clinical outcomes of Zika virus infection? A systematic review, pooled analysis and lessons learned
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 13
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) recently caused a pandemic complicated by Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and birth defects. ZIKV is structurally similar to the dengue viruses (DENV) and in vitro studies suggest antibody dependent enhancement occurs in ZIKV infections preceded by DENV; however, the clinical significance of this remains unclear. We undertook a PRISMA-adherent systematic review of all current human and non-human primate (NHP) data to determine if prior infection with DENV, compared to DENV-naïve hosts, is associated with a greater risk of ZIKV clinical complications or greater ZIKV peak viremia in vivo. We identified 1146 studies in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the grey literature, of which five studies were eligible. One human study indicated no increase in the risk of GBS in ZIKV infections with prior DENV exposure. Two additional human studies showed a small increase in ZIKV viremia in those with prior DENV exposure; however, this was not statistically significant nor was it associated with an increase in clinical severity or adverse pregnancy outcomes. While no meta-analysis was possible using human data, a pooled analysis of the two NHP studies leveraging extended data provided only weak evidence of a 0.39 log10 GE/mL rise in ZIKV viremia in DENV experienced rhesus macaques compared to those with no DENV exposure (p = 0.22). Using a customized quality grading criteria, we further show that no existing published human studies have offered high quality measurement of both acute ZIKV and antecedent DENV infections. In conclusion, limited human and NHP studies indicate a small and non-statistically significant increase in ZIKV viremia in DENV-experienced versus DENV-naïve hosts; however, there is no evidence that even a possible small increase in ZIKV viremia would correlate with a change in ZIKV clinical phenotype. More data derived from larger sample sizes and improved sero-assays are needed to resolve this question, which has major relevance for clinical prognosis and vaccine design.

AB  - A mathematical model to describe the dynamic of a multiserotype infectious disease at the population level is studied. Applied to dengue fever epidemiology, we analyse a mathematical model with time delay to describe the cross-immunity protection period, including a key parameter for the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect, the well-known features of dengue fever infection. Numerical experiments are performed to show the stability of the coexistence equilibrium, which is completely determined by the basic reproduction number and by the invasion reproduction number, as well as the bifurcation structures for different scenarios of dengue fever transmission in a population. The model shows a rich dynamical behavior, from fixed points and periodic oscillations up to chaotic behaviour with complex attractors.

JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 169
SP  - 657
EP  - 664
AB  - The onset of vascular leakage and hemorrhagic diathesis is one of the life-threatening complications occurring in dengue patients, yet the pathogenic mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we demonstrated that Abs against dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) generated in mice cross-reacted with human endothelial cells and mouse vessel endothelium. After binding, mouse anti-NS1 Abs induced endothelial cell apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner. Inducible NO synthase expression could be observed; it showed a time- and dose-dependent correlation with NO production. Endothelial cell apoptosis, characterized by exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface and nuclear DNA fragmentation, was blocked by treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. Further studies demonstrated that the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL decreased in both mRNA and protein levels, whereas p53 and Bax increased after anti-NS1 treatment. Cytochrome c release was also observed. All of these effects could be inhibited by Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. Taken together, anti-NS1 Abs act as autoantibodies that cross-react with noninfected endothelial cells and trigger the intracellular signaling leading to the production of NO and to apoptosis. Endothelial cell damage may cause vascular leakage that contributes to the pathogenesis of dengue disease.

TI  - Endothelial Cell Sensitization by Death Receptor Fractions of an Anti–Dengue Nonstructural Protein 1 Antibody Induced Plasma Leakage, Coagulopathy, and Mortality in Mice
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 195
SP  - 2743
EP  - 2753
AB  - The mechanisms leading to the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) remain elusive. DHF preferentially occurs during secondary dengue infections, suggesting that aberrant immune responses are involved in its development. We previously demonstrated that the autoantibodies elicited by dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1; anti–NS1 Igs) induce plasma leakage and mortality in mice with warfarinized anticoagulant suppression. However, the involved pathogenic Ig fractions of anti–NS1 Igs remain unclear. In this study, the autoreactive Igs in patients with DHF and in NS1-immunized rabbits crossreacted with TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 1 (death receptor [DR]4). Challenges with the DENV in a subcytotoxic dose sensitized endothelial cells to apoptosis. Treatments with the autoantibodies induced proapoptotic activities and suppressed the surface expression of endothelial anticoagulant thrombomodulin. Combined treatments comprising the DENV and DR4 affinity-purified fractions of anti–NS1 IgGs (anti–NS1-DR4 Ig), but not preimmune control IgGs, in subcytotoxic doses led to apoptosis in endothelial cells. Treatments with the anti–NS1-DR4 Ig led to plasma leakage, coagulopathy, and morality in mice with warfarinized anticoagulant suppression. These results suggest that DR4-induced endothelial cell sensitization through NS1-elicited autoantibodies exacerbates anticoagulant suppression, vascular injury, and plasma leakage. Detecting and blocking anti–DR Igs in patients may be novel strategies for managing severe DENV infection.

AB  - The Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) hypothesis has been proposed to explain why more severe manifestations of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DHF/DSS) occur predominantly during secondary infections of Dengue Virus (DV) with different serotypes. However, the epitopes recognized by these enhancing antibodies are unclear. Recently, antipre-M monoclonal antibody (mAb 70-21), which recognized all DV serotypes without neutralizing activity, were generated and demonstrated as an enhancing antibody for DV infection. In the present study, the epitope recognized by mAb 70-21 was identified using a phage-displayed random-peptide library. After three rounds of biopanning, ELISA showed that immunopositive phage clones specifically bound to mAb 70-21 but not to serum or purified IgG from naive mice. DNA sequencing of these phage clones showed a consensus sequence, QNNLGPR. Like mAb70-21, these phageinduced antisera also enhanced the DV infection of cells. In addition, indirect fluorescent assays showed phage-induced antisera bound to human rhabdomyosarcoma or Vero cells. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation analysis showed that phage-induced antisera recognized hsp 60 in BHK cell lysate. Moreover, the sera levels of antibodies against the synthetic peptide QNNLGPR correlated with the disease severity of dengue patients. Taken together, these results suggest that antibodies which recognized epitopes shared by pre-M of DV and hsp 60 of host cells may enhance DV infection and be involved in the development of DHF or DSS.

TI  - Functional genomics screens reveal a role for TBC1D24 and SV2B in antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) can hijack non-neutralizing IgG antibodies to facilitate its uptake into target cells expressing Fc gamma receptors (FcgR) - a process known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Beyond a requirement for FcgR, host dependency factors for this non-canonical infection route remain unknown. To identify cellular factors exclusively required for ADE, here, we performed CRISPR knockout screens in an in vitro system permissive to infection only in the presence of IgG antibodies. Validating our approach, a top hit was FcgRIIa, which facilitates binding and internalization of IgG-bound DENV but is not required for canonical infection. Additionally, we identified host factors with no previously described role in DENV infection, including TBC1D24 and SV2B, both of which have known functions in regulated secretion. Using genetic knockout and trans-complemented cells, we validated a functional requirement for these host factors in ADE assays performed with monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal sera in multiple cell lines and using all four DENV serotypes. We show that knockout of TBC1D24 or SV2B impaired binding of IgG-DENV complexes to cells without affecting FcgRIIa expression levels. Thus, we identify cellular factors beyond FcgR that are required for ADE of DENV infection. Our findings represent a first step towards advancing fundamental knowledge behind the biology of ADE that can ultimately be exploited to inform vaccination and therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Generation of Anti-platelet Autoantibody During Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - American Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 4
SP  - 50
EP  - 59
AB  - Dengue virus infection causes dengue fever, Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). Thrombocytopenia is common in dengue fever and is always found in DHF/DSS. The pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia is poorly understood. To further understand the relationship between anti-dengue virus antibody and anti-platelet antibody, we generated monoclonal anti-dengue virus antibodies from the dengue virus infected mice that developed transient thrombocytopenia post dengue infection. The analysis of a panel of monoclonal anti-NS-1 antibodies reveals three different patterns of platelet binding: strong, intermediate, or dull. Their isotypes are different, some are IgM while others are IgG1. Most of anti-platelet antibodies are cross-reactive with NS-1 of dengue virus and can be competitively inhibited by recombinant NS-1 protein, suggesting a molecular mimicry between dengue virus NS-1 protein and platelet. A clone, 13-F4-G5, preferentially bound activated platelets, can recognize two or three proteins around 150 kD on platelets. The binding to platelet would lyse the platelet in the presence of complement or enhance the ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Furthermore, some of these monoclonal antibodies would also react with the cellular antigens of BHK. Based on the data, we conclude that dengue virus infection induces auto anti-platelet antibodies which thereafter may involve in the manifestation of thrombocytopenia. A molecular mimicry between NS-1 and platelet is demonstrated.

TI  - Generation of IgM anti‐platelet autoantibody in dengue patients
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 63
AB  - Dengue virus infection causes a wide range of diseases from dengue fever to life‐threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). The mechanisms involved in DHF/DSS pathogenesis remain unclear. Patient sera collected from an outbreak in southern Taiwan from November 1998 to January 1999 were studied. The presence of antibodies which cross‐reacted with platelets could be detected in patient sera, and the isotype of these autoantibodies was IgM. The anti‐platelet IgM levels were higher in DHF/DSS than in dengue fever patient sera in disease acute phase. These autoantibodies were still detectable in convalescent stage (1–3 weeks after acute phase) and even eight to nine months after illness. The platelet binding activity was not observed in other virus‐infected patient sera tested. Further investigation showed that dengue patient sera caused platelet lysis in the presence of complement. The platelet cytotoxicity induced by DHF/DSS patient sera was higher than that by dengue fever sera. Dengue patient sera also inhibited platelet aggregation which, however, appeared to be not related to DHF/DSS development. J. Med. Virol. 63:143–149, 2001. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

AB  - Infection with dengue virus (DENV) can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to death. It is estimated that the disease manifests only in 90 million cases out of the total 390 million yearly infections. Even though research has not yet elucidated which are the precise pathophysiological mechanisms that trigger severe forms of dengue, the infection elicits a critical immune response significant for dengue pathogenesis development. Understanding how the immune response to DENV is established and how it can resolve the infection or turn into an immunopathology is of great importance in DENV research. Currently, studies have extensively debated 2 hypotheses involving immune response: antibody-dependent enhancement and cytokine storm. However, despite its undeniable importance in severe forms of the disease, these 2 hypotheses are based on a primed immune status resulting from previous heterologous infection, abstaining them from explaining the severe forms of dengue in naive immune subjects, for example. Thus, it seems that a more intricate arrangement of causes and conditions must be achieved to severe dengue to occur. Among them, the cytokine network signature elicited, in association with viral aspects deserves special attention regarding the establishment of infection and evolution to pathogenesis. In this work, we intend to shed light on how those elements contribute to severe dengue development.

TI  - How Innate Immune Mechanisms Contribute to Antibody-Enhanced Viral Infections
JF  - Clinical and Vaccine Immunology
VL  - 17
SP  - 1829
EP  - 1835
AB  - ABSTRACT Preexisting antibodies may enhance viral infections. In dengue, nonneutralizing antibodies raised by natural infection with one of four dengue viruses (DENVs) may enhance infection with a different virus by a process we term “intrinsic antibody-dependent enhancement” (iADE). In addition, nonprotective antibodies raised by formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and measles virus vaccines have led to enhanced disease during breakthrough infections. Infections under iADE conditions not only facilitate the process of viral entry into monocytes and macrophages but also modify innate and adaptive intracellular antiviral mechanisms, suppressing type 1 interferon (IFN) production and resulting in enhanced DENV replication. The suppression observed in vitro has been documented in patients with severe (dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF]) but not in patient with mild (dengue fever [DF]) secondary dengue virus infections. Important veterinary viral infections also may exhibit iADE. It is thought that use of formalin deconforms viral epitopes of RSV, resulting in poor Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation; suboptimal maturation of dendritic cells with reduced production of activation factors CD40, CD80, and CD86; decreased germinal center formation in lymph nodes; and the production of nonprotective antibodies. These antibodies fail to neutralize RSV, allowing replication with secondary stimulation of RSV-primed Th2 cells producing more low-avidity antibody, resulting in immune complexes deposited into affected tissue. However, when formalin-inactivated RSV was administered with a TLR agonist to mice, they were protected against wild-type virus challenge. Safe and effective vaccines against RSV/measles virus and dengue virus may benefit from a better understanding of how innate immune responses can promote production of protective antibodies.

TI  - IFITM Proteins Restrict Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins restrict the entry processes of several pathogenic viruses, including the flaviviruses West Nile virus and dengue virus (DENV). DENV infects cells directly or via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in Fc-receptor-bearing cells, a process thought to contribute to severe disease in a secondary infection. Here we investigated whether ADE-mediated DENV infection bypasses IFITM-mediated restriction or whether IFITM proteins can be protective in a secondary infection. We observed that IFITM proteins restricted ADE-mediated and direct infection with comparable efficiencies in a myelogenous leukemia cell line. Our data suggest that IFITM proteins can contribute to control of secondary DENV infections.

The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is discussed in the context of dengue haemorrhagic fever and the dengue shock syndrome.

TI  - Intrinsic ADE: The Dark Side of Antibody Dependent Enhancement During Dengue Infection
JF  - Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology
VL  - 10
AB  - Dengue fever is an Aedes mosquito-borne illness caused by any one of the four different dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (1–4) and manifests in the form of symptoms ranging from mild or asymptomatic to severe disease with vascular leakage, leading to shock, and viral hemorrhagic syndrome. Increased risk of severe disease occurs during secondary infection with a virus serotype distinct from that of prior dengue infection. This occurs by antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, wherein sub-neutralizing antibodies against the virus particles opsonize dengue virus entry via formation of immune complexes that interact with fragment crystallizable gamma receptors (FcγR) on monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. The ADE phenomenon has two components: Extrinsic and Intrinsic ADE. While extrinsic ADE contributes to enhanced virus entry, intrinsic ADE results in heightened virus production by inhibition of type1 interferon and activation of interleukin-10 biosynthesis, thereby favoring a Th2 type immune response. Intrinsic ADE has greater contribution in enhancing Dengue replication as compared to extrinsic ADE. Detailed elucidation of intrinsic ADE during secondary dengue infection can increase our understanding of DENV-pathogenesis and aid in the development of host-targeting antivirals. Here we review literature focusing on intrinsic factors contributing to severe dengue pathology and suggest possible avenues for further research.

TI  - Kinetics of NS1 and anti-NS1 IgG following dengue infection reveals likely early formation of immune complexes in secondary infected patients
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 15
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a major health concern throughout the world infecting up to 390 million people globally each year. Infection with any one of the four DENV serotypes produces a spectrum of clinical illness ranging from a mild undifferentiated febrile disease through to severe dengue involving fever and haemorrhage. There is currently no antiviral treatment for dengue and only one licensed vaccine with limited distribution. This study characterises the kinetics of the serological dengue biomarker, NS1, and the appearance of anti-NS1 IgG, anti-E IgM and anti-E IgG responses in patients with primary and secondary infections. Blood samples were collected daily from a cohort of 52 Vietnamese patients during the acute phase of disease. NS1 was detected in 85% of patient samples from disease onset with detection decreasing throughout the acute phase of disease. Anti-NS1 IgG detected from the fourth day of illness and anti-E IgM and IgG from the third day of illness, were all observed to increase throughout the course of the disease. During secondary infection, NS1 levels rapidly decrease with the increasing levels of anti-NS1 IgG, suggesting the possibility of NS1 immune complex formation and a potential role in the pathogenesis of the severe forms of disease associated with secondary infections.

EP  - 2405
AB  - Antibodies are a critical component of the defense system against pathogenic microorganisms. This aspect is most drastically demonstrated in patients who are not able to mount sufficient antibody responses because of underlying genetic disorders, as exemplified by the OMEMM syndrome, X-linked agammaglobulineamia, or different hyper IgM syndromes (1, 2). Supplying these patients with pooled IgG preparations from healthy or hyperimmune donors is a very successful standard therapy for preventing infections, providing direct evidence for the important role of antibodies in the establishment of sterile immunity. With respect to blocking viral infections, IgG and IgA antibodies can inhibit the attachment of viruses to host cells, such as the blockade of binding of the HIV to T-helper cells, or by blocking the attachment of influenza virus to sugar structures on the cell surface. As will be discussed later, a notable exception to this rule is dengue virus, where preexisting antibodies may result in an antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) (3, 4). Although the process of virus neutralization was considered to be independent of the recruitment of effector pathways afforded by the innate immune system, recent evidence suggests that binding of IgG–virus immune complexes to innate immune effector cells via Fcγ-receptors (FcγR) is of great importance. Thus, neutralizing antibody dependent inhibition of HIV or influenza infection, as well as blocking the activity of bacterial toxins by passive immunotherapy, was shown to be critically dependent on activating FcγRs in vivo (5 …

TI  - Lethal Antibody Enhancement of Dengue Disease in Mice Is Prevented by Fc Modification
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 6
AB  - Immunity to one of the four dengue virus (DV) serotypes can increase disease severity in humans upon subsequent infection with another DV serotype. Serotype cross-reactive antibodies facilitate DV infection of myeloid cells in vitro by promoting virus entry via Fcγ receptors (FcγR), a process known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). However, despite decades of investigation, no in vivo model for antibody enhancement of dengue disease severity has been described. Analogous to human infants who receive anti-DV antibodies by transplacental transfer and develop severe dengue disease during primary infection, we show here that passive administration of anti-DV antibodies is sufficient to enhance DV infection and disease in mice using both mouse-adapted and clinical DV isolates. Antibody-enhanced lethal disease featured many of the hallmarks of severe dengue disease in humans, including thrombocytopenia, vascular leakage, elevated serum cytokine levels, and increased systemic viral burden in serum and tissue phagocytes. Passive transfer of a high dose of serotype-specific antibodies eliminated viremia, but lower doses of these antibodies or cross-reactive polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies all enhanced disease in vivo even when antibody levels were neutralizing in vitro. In contrast, a genetically engineered antibody variant (E60-N297Q) that cannot bind FcγR exhibited prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against ADE-induced lethal challenge. These observations provide insight into the pathogenesis of antibody-enhanced dengue disease and identify a novel strategy for the design of therapeutic antibodies against dengue.

TI  - Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B1 is critical for antibody-dependent dengue
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 111
SP  - 2722
EP  - 2727
AB  - Significance Dengue virus (DENV) infects almost 400 million people annually and some of these infections result in life threatening disease. An incomplete understanding of pathogenesis, particularly on how non- or subneutralizing levels of antibody augments DENV infection of cells expressing Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs), has hampered vaccine development. Here, we show that, to overcome the activating FcγR-dependent expression of type-I interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), DENV binds and activates the inhibitory receptor, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor-B1 (LILRB1). LILRB1 signals through its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif cytoplasmic tail to inhibit the expression of ISGs required for successful antibody-dependent DENV infection. Inhibition of DENV activation of LILRB1 could hence be a strategy for vaccine or therapeutic design. Viruses must evade the host innate defenses for replication and dengue is no exception. During secondary infection with a heterologous dengue virus (DENV) serotype, DENV is opsonized with sub- or nonneutralizing antibodies that enhance infection of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells via the Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR), a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection. However, this enhancement of DENV infection is curious as cross-linking of activating FcγRs signals an early antiviral response by inducing the type-I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Entry through activating FcγR would thus place DENV in an intracellular environment unfavorable for enhanced replication. Here we demonstrate that, to escape this antiviral response, antibody-opsonized DENV coligates leukocyte Ig-like receptor-B1 (LILRB1) to inhibit FcγR signaling for ISG expression. This immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif-bearing receptor recruits Src homology phosphatase-1 to dephosphorylate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). As Syk is a key intermediate of FcγR signaling, LILRB1 coligation resulted in reduced ISG expression for enhanced DENV replication. Our findings suggest a unique mechanism for DENV to evade an early antiviral response for enhanced infection.

JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 108
SP  - 12479
EP  - 12484
AB  - The interaction of antibodies, dengue virus (DENV), and monocytes can result in either immunity or enhanced virus infection. These opposing outcomes of dengue antibodies have hampered dengue vaccine development. Recent studies have shown that antibodies neutralize DENV by either preventing virus attachment to cellular receptors or inhibiting viral fusion intracellularly. However, whether the antibody blocks attachment or fusion, the resulting immune complexes are expected to be phagocytosed by Fc gamma receptor (FcγR)-bearing cells and cleared from circulation. This suggests that only antibodies that are able to block fusion intracellularly would be able to neutralize DENV upon FcγR-mediated uptake by monocytes whereas other antibodies would have resulted in enhancement of DENV replication. Using convalescent sera from dengue patients, we observed that neutralization of the homologous serotypes occurred despite FcγR-mediated uptake. However, FcγR-mediated uptake appeared to be inhibited when neutralized heterologous DENV serotypes were used instead. We demonstrate that this inhibition occurred through the formation of viral aggregates by antibodies in a concentration-dependent manner. Aggregation of viruses enabled antibodies to cross-link the inhibitory FcγRIIB, which is expressed at low levels but which inhibits FcγR-mediated phagocytosis and hence prevents antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection in monocytes.

JF  - Virology Journal
VL  - 9
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) are the most important arboviruses of humans and cause significant disease. Infection with DENV elicits antibody responses to the envelope glycoprotein, predominantly against immunodominant, cross-reactive, weakly-neutralizing epitopes. These weakly-neutralizing antibodies are implicated in enhancing infection via Fcγ receptor bearing cells and can lead to increased viral loads that are associated with severe disease. Here we describe results from the development and testing of cross-reactivity reduced DENV-2 DNA vaccine candidates that contain substitutions in immunodominant B cell epitopes of the fusion peptide and domain III of the envelope protein. Cross-reactivity reduced and wild-type vaccine candidates were similarly immunogenic in outbred mice and elicited high levels of neutralizing antibody, however mice immunized with cross-reactivity reduced vaccines produced significantly reduced levels of immunodominant cross-reactive antibodies. Sera from mice immunized with wild-type, fusion peptide-, or domain III- substitution containing vaccines enhanced heterologous DENV infection in vitro, unlike sera from mice immunized with a vaccine containing a combination of both fusion peptide and domain III substitutions. Passive transfer of immune sera from mice immunized with fusion peptide and domain III substitutions also reduced the development of severe DENV disease in AG129 mice when compared to mice receiving wild type immune sera. Reducing cross-reactivity in the envelope glycoprotein of DENV may be an approach to improve the quality of the anti-DENV immune response.

TI  - Maternal Antibody-Mediated Disease Enhancement in Type I Interferon-Deficient Mice Leads to Lethal Disease Associated with Liver Damage
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 10
AB  - Epidemiological studies have reported that most of the severe dengue cases occur upon a secondary heterologous infection. Furthermore, babies born to dengue immune mothers are at greater risk of developing severe disease upon primary infection with a heterologous or homologous dengue virus (DENV) serotype when maternal antibodies reach sub-neutralizing concentrations. These observations have been explained by the antibody mediated disease enhancement (ADE) phenomenon whereby heterologous antibodies or sub-neutralizing homologous antibodies bind to but fail to neutralize DENV particles, allowing Fc-receptor mediated entry of the virus-antibody complexes into host cells. This eventually results in enhanced viral replication and heightened inflammatory responses. In an attempt to replicate this ADE phenomenon in a mouse model, we previously reported that upon DENV2 infection 5-week old type I and II interferon (IFN) receptors-deficient mice (AG129) born to DENV1-immune mothers displayed enhancement of disease severity characterized by increased virus titers and extensive vascular leakage which eventually led to the animals’ death. However, as dengue occurs in immune competent individuals, we sought to reproduce this mouse model in a less immunocompromised background. Here, we report an ADE model that is mediated by maternal antibodies in type I IFN receptor-deficient A129 mice. We show that 5-week old A129 mice born to DENV1-immune mothers succumbed to a DENV2 infection within 4 days that was sub-lethal in mice born to naïve mothers. Clinical manifestations included extensive hepatocyte vacuolation, moderate vascular leakage, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Anti-TNFα therapy totally protected the mice and correlated with healthy hepatocytes. In contrast, blocking IL-6 did not impact the virus titers or disease outcome. This A129 mouse model of ADE may help dissecting the mechanisms involved in dengue pathogenesis and evaluate the efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates.

JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 71 ( Pt 12)
SP  - 2909
EP  - 14
AB  - Although its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, data comparing each of the four dengue virus serotypes suggest that in vitro antibody-dependent infection enhancement is a reproducible and measurable phenomenon related to other serological measures of antibody-virus binding. Information characterizing infection enhancement may provide clues to disease pathogenesis for dengue and other viruses that exhibit antibody-enhanced infection. We propose criteria for the detection and quantification of in vitro antibody-dependent enhancement of flavivirus infection based on observations using all four dengue virus serotypes, macrophage-like cell lines and human peripheral blood monocytes, and various immune sera and monoclonal antibodies. It is proposed that antibody-dependent infection enhancement is defined by the following findings: (i) significantly increased virus production is measured in quantitative assays at different points on the growth curve; (ii) assays of the virus output of cells infected with mixtures of constant amounts of virus and serial dilutions of the pre-existing antibody source produce characteristic 'enhancement profiles' of rising and falling virus output over at least a 10(-3)-fold dilution range; (iii) for each enhancing antibody source the dilution producing maximal infection enhancement is related to other serological measures of binding to the envelope, or another virus component; (iv) infection enhancement is detected with different antibody sources and virus strains (when available) tested over a range of m.o.i.; (v) other causes of enhanced virus production are ruled out.

TI  - Mechanism of glycoform specificity and protection against antibody dependent enhancement by an anti-afucosylated IgG nanobody
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies contain a single, complex N-glycan on each IgG heavy chain protomer embedded in the hydrophobic pocket between its Cγ2 domains. The presence of this glycan contributes to the structural organization of the Fc domain and determines its specificity for Fcγ receptors, thereby determining distinct cellular responses. On the Fc, the variable construction of this glycan structure leads to a family of highly-related, but non-equivalent glycoproteins known as glycoforms. We previously reported the development of synthetic nanobodies that distinguish IgG glycoforms without cross-reactivity to off-target glycoproteins or free glycans. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of one such nanobody, X0, in complex with its specific binding partner, the Fc fragment of afucosylated IgG1. Two X0 nanobodies bind a single afucosylated Fc homodimer at the upper Cγ2 domain, making both protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate contacts and overlapping the binding site for Fcγ receptors. Upon binding, the elongated CDR3 loop of X0 undergoes a conformational shift to access the buried N-glycan and acts as a ‘glycan sensor’, forming hydrogen bonds with the afucosylated IgG N-glycan that would otherwise be sterically hindered by the presence of a core fucose residue. Based on this structure, we designed X0 fusion constructs that disrupt pathogenic afucosylated IgG1-FcγRIIIa interactions and rescue mice in a model of dengue virus infection.

TI  - Metabolomic landscape of macrophage discloses an anabolic signature of dengue virus infection and antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection
JF  - PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 18
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes dengue fever, the most prevalent arthropod-transmitted viral disease worldwide. Viruses are acellular parasites and obligately rely on host cell machinery for reproduction. Previous studies have indicated metabolomic changes in endothelial cell models and sera of animal models and patients with dengue fever. To probe the immunometabolic mechanism of DENV infection, here, we report the metabolomic landscape of a human macrophage cell model of DENV infection and its antibody-dependent enhancement. DENV infection of THP-1-derived macrophages caused 202 metabolic variants, of which amino acids occupied 23.7%, fatty acids 21.78%, carbohydrates 10.4%, organic acids 13.37%, and carnitines 10.4%. These metabolomic changes indicated an overall anabolic signature, which was characterized by the global exhaustion of amino acids, increases of cellular fatty acids, carbohydrates and pentoses, but decreases of acylcarnitine. Significant activation of metabolic pathways of glycolysis, pentose phosphate, amino acid metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid cycle collectively support the overall anabolism to meet metabolic demands of DENV replication and immune activation by viral infection. Totally 88 of 202 metabolic variants were significantly changed by DENV infection, 36 of which met the statistical standard (P<0.05, VIP>1.5) of differentially expressed metabolites, which were the predominantly decreased variants of acylcarnitine and the increased variants of fatty acids and carbohydrates. Remarkably, 11 differentially expressed metabolites were significantly distinct between DENV only infection and antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection. Our data suggested that the anabolic activation by DENV infection integrates the viral replication and anti-viral immune activation.

TI  - Molecular Mimicry between Dengue Virus and Coagulation Factors Induces Antibodies To Inhibit Thrombin Activity and Enhance Fibrinolysis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 13759
EP  - 13768
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common cause of viral hemorrhagic fever, and it may lead to life-threating dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Because most cases of DHF/DSS occur in patients with secondary DENV infection, anti-DENV antibodies are generally considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS. Previously, we have found that antithrombin antibodies (ATAs) with both antithrombotic and profibrinolytic activities are present in the sera of dengue patients. However, the mechanism by which these autoantibodies are induced is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that antibodies induced by DENV immunization in mice and rabbits could bind to DENV antigens as well as to human thrombin and plasminogen (Plg). The binding of anti-DENV antibodies to thrombin and Plg was inhibited by preadsorption with DENV nonstructural protein 1. In addition, affinity-purified ATAs from DENV-immunized rabbit sera could inhibit thrombin activity and enhance Plg activation both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that molecular mimicry between DENV and coagulation factors can induce the production of autoantibodies with biological effects similar to those of ATAs found in dengue patients. These coagulation-factor cross-reactive anti-DENV antibodies can interfere with the balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis, which may lead to the tendency of DHF/DSS patients to bleed. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease in tropical and subtropical areas. Over 50 million DENV infection cases develop each year, and more than 2.5 billion people are at risk of dengue-induced hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Currently, there is no vaccine or drug treatment for DENV. In the present study, we demonstrated that DENV immunization could induce thrombin and plasminogen (Plg) cross-reactive antibodies, which were able to inhibit thrombin activity and enhance Plg activation. These results suggest that molecular mimicry between DENV antigens, thrombin, and Plg may elicit antibodies that disturb hemostasis. The selection of appropriate candidate antigens for use in DENV vaccines should prevent these potentially dangerous autoimmune responses.

AB  - The pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), both serious complications of dengue virus (DV) infection, remains unclear. In this study, we found that anti-DV NS1 (nonstructural protein 1) polyclonal antibodies cross-reacted with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We further identified a complex-specific mAb, DB16-1, which could recognize DV NS1 and cross-react with HUVECs and human blood vessels. The target protein of DB16-1 was further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. LC-MS/MS analysis and co-immunoprecipitation revealed that the target protein of DB16-1 was human LYRIC (lysine-rich CEACAM1 co-isolated). Our newly generated anti-LYRIC mAbs bound to HUVECs in a pattern similar to that of DB16-1. The B-cell epitope of DB16-1 displayed a consensus motif, Lys-X-Trp-Gly (KXWG), which corresponded to amino acid residues 116–119 of DV NS1 and mimicked amino acid residues 334–337 in LYRIC. Moreover, the binding activity of DB16-1 in NS1 of DV-2 and in LYRIC disappeared after the KXWG epitope was deleted in each. In conclusion, DB16-1 targeted the same epitope in DV NS1 and LYRIC protein on human endothelial cells, suggesting that it might play a role in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS. Future studies on the role of the anti-NS1 antibody in causing vascular permeability will undoubtedly be performed on sera collected from individuals before, during, and after the endothelial cell malfunction phase of a dengue illness.

AB  - Infection with dengue virus (DENV) or any other flavivirus induces cross-reactive, but weakly neutralizing or nonneutralizing, antibodies that recognize epitopes involving the fusion peptide in the envelope glycoprotein. Humanized mAb IgG 1A5, derived from a chimpanzee, shares properties of cross-reactive antibodies. mAb IgG 1A5 up-regulated DENV infection by a mechanism of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in a variety of Fc receptor-bearing cells in vitro. A 10- to 1,000-fold increase of viral yield in K562 cells, dependent on the DENV serotype, was observed over a range of subneutralizing concentrations of IgG 1A5. A significant increase of DENV-4 viremia titers (up to 100-fold) was also demonstrated in juvenile rhesus monkeys immunized with passively transferred dilutions of IgG 1A5. These results, together with earlier findings of ADE of DENV-2 infection by a polyclonal serum, establish the primate model for analysis of ADE. Considering the abundance of these cross-reactive antibodies, our observations confirm that significant viral amplification could occur during DENV infections in humans with prior infection or with maternally transferred immunity, possibly leading to severe dengue. Strategies to eliminate ADE were explored by altering the antibody Fc structures responsible for binding to Fc receptors. IgG 1A5 variants, containing amino acid substitutions from the Fc region of IgG2 or IgG4 antibodies, reduced but did not eliminate DENV-4-enhancing activity in K562 cells. Importantly, a 9-aa deletion at the N terminus of the CH2 domain in the Fc region abrogated the enhancing activity.

TI  - NK Cells Activated through Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity and Armed with Degranulation/IFN-γ Production Suppress Antibody-dependent Enhancement of Dengue Viral Infection
JF  - Scientific Reports
VL  - 9
AB  - Antibody (Ab)-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a hypothesized mechanism of increased disease severity during secondary dengue virus (DENV) infection. This study investigates Ab-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) in counteracting ADE. In our system, DENV and DENV-immune sera were added to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and ADE and NK cell activation were simultaneously monitored. ADE was detected in monocytes and a concurrent activation of NK cells was observed. Activated NK cells expressed IFN-γ and CD107a. IFN-γ was detected at 24 hours (24 h) followed by a rapid decline; CD107a expression peaked at 48 h and persisted for >7 days. Optimal activation of NK cells required the presence of enhancement serum together with ADE-affected monocytes and soluble factors, suggesting the coexistence of the counteractive ADCC Abs, in the same ADE-serum, capable of strongly promoting NK cell activation. The function of NK cells against ADE was demonstrated using a depletion assay. NK cell-depleted PBMCs had increased ADE as compared to whole PBMCs. Conversely, adding activated NK cells back into the NK-depleted-PBMCs or to purified monocytes decreased ADE. Blocking IFN-γ expression also increased ADE. The study suggests that under ADE conditions, NK cells can be activated by ADCC Abs and can control the magnitude of ADE.

JF  - Journal of vector borne diseases
VL  - 51 3
SP  - 153
EP  - 64
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES
The present study aimed to systematically quantify the well known risk of severe dengue during secondary infection in literature and to understand how epidemiological mechanisms of enhancement during the secondary infection influence the empirically estimated risk of severe dengue by means of mathematical modeling.


METHODS
Two conditional risks of severe dengue, i.e. symptomatic illness and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), given secondary infection were explored based on systematically searched prospective studies. A two-strain epidemiological model was employed to simulate the transmission dynamics of dengue and to identify the relevant data gaps in empirical observations.


RESULTS
Using the variance-based weighting, the pooled relative risk (RR) of symptomatic illness during secondary infection was estimated at 9.4 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.1-14.4], and similarly, RR of DHF/DSS was estimated to be 23.7 (95% CI: 15.3-36.9). A variation in the RR of DHF/DSS was observed among prospective studies. Using the mathematical modeling technique, we identified the duration of cross-protective immunity as an important modulator of the time-dependent behaviour of the RR of severe dengue. Different epidemiological mechanisms of enhancement during secondary infection yielded different RR of severe dengue.


INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION
Optimal design of prospective cohort study for dengue should be considered, accounting for the time-dependence in the RR during the course of dengue epidemic. It is critical to statistically infer the duration of cross-protective immunity and clarify how the enhancement influences the epidemiological dynamics during secondary infection.

JF  - Journal of Virology

EP  - 2675
AB  - ABSTRACT Symptomatic dengue virus infection ranges in disease severity from an influenza-like illness to life-threatening shock. One model of the mechanism underlying severe disease proposes that weakly neutralizing, dengue serotype cross-reactive antibodies induced during a primary infection facilitate virus entry into Fc receptor-bearing cells during a subsequent secondary infection, increasing viral replication and the release of cytokines and vasoactive mediators, culminating in shock. This process has been termed antibody-dependent enhancement of infection and has significantly hindered vaccine development. Much of our understanding of this process has come from studies using mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs); however, antibody responses in mice typically exhibit less complexity than those in humans. A better understanding of the humoral immune response to natural dengue virus infection in humans is sorely needed. Using a high-efficiency human hybridoma technology, we isolated 37 hybridomas secreting human MAbs to dengue viruses from 12 subjects years or even decades following primary or secondary infection. The majority of the human antibodies recovered were broadly cross-reactive, directed against either envelope or premembrane proteins, and capable of enhancement of infection in vitro; few exhibited serotype-specific binding or potent neutralizing activity. Memory B cells encoding enhancing antibodies predominated in the circulation, even two or more decades following infection. Mapping the epitopes and activity of naturally occurring dengue antibodies should prove valuable in determining whether the enhancing and neutralizing activity of antibodies can be separated. Such principles could be used in the rational design of vaccines that enhance the induction of neutralizing antibodies, while lowering the risk of dengue shock syndrome.

TI  - Primary human endothelial cells support direct but not antibody‐dependent enhancement of dengue viral infection
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 81
AB  - Microvascular plasma leakage is the hallmark of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The precise molecular mechanisms leading to microvascular leakage are yet to be determined, but dengue virus (DENV) infection and consequent endothelial cell death has been suggested as its major cause. However, the extent of endothelial cell permissiveness to DENV infection and the magnitude of cell death following DENV infection are controversial. To clarify this issue, we analyzed the kinetics and consequences of DENV infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) using a novel molecularly cloned DENV2‐16681 virus. Viral replication was detected as early as 24 hr post‐infection by RT‐PCR and plaque assays. However, merely 2% of HUVEC were DENV antigen‐positive even after 96 hr of infection as measured by the FACS indirect immunofluorescence assays. Unlike monocytes/macrophages, HUVEC did not support antibody dependent enhancement of dengue viral infection due to a lack of FcγRI and FcγRII. Furthermore, DENV infection did not increase HUVEC apoptosis as compared to mock‐infected cells. Because in vitro only a small percentage of endothelial cells were productively infected in vitro with no significant apoptosis occurring in either infected or bystander cells, it would be important to re‐examine whether direct dengue viral infection of endothelium is the major cause of the extensive vascular leakage observed in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.

TI  - Protein Disulfide Isomerase Inhibitor Suppresses Viral Replication and Production during Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Virus Infection in Human Monocytic Cells
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - One of several mechanisms that leads to the development of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Monocytes can be infected by the ADE phenomenon, which occurs in dengue secondary infection. This study aimed to investigate the proteins involved in ADE of DENV infection in the human monocytic cell line U937. The phosphoproteins were used to perform and analyze for protein expression using mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS). The differential phosphoproteins revealed 1131 altered proteins compared between isotype- and DENV-specific antibody-treated monocytes. The altered proteins revealed 558 upregulated proteins and 573 downregulated proteins. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which is an enzyme that had a high-ranking fold change and that catalyzes the formation, breakage, and rearrangement of disulfide bonds within a protein molecule, was selected for further study. PDI was found to be important for dengue virus infectivity during the ADE model. The effect of PDI inhibition was also shown to be involved in the early stage of life cycle by time-of-drug-addition assay. These results suggest that PDI is important for protein translation and virion assembly of dengue virus during infection in human monocytes, and it may play a significant role as a chaperone to stabilize dengue protein synthesis.

The target proteins, including ATP synthase β chain, protein disulfide isomerase, vimentin, and heat shock protein 60, co-localize with anti-NS1 binding sites on nonfixed HMEC-1 cells using immunohistochemical double staining and confocal microscopy. The cross-reactivity of anti-target protein antibodies with HMEC-1 cells was inhibited by NS1 protein pre-absorption. Furthermore, a cross-reactive epitope on NS1 amino acid residues 311–330 (P311–330) was predicted using homologous sequence alignment. The reactivity of dengue hemorrhagic patient sera with HMEC-1 cells was blocked by synthetic peptide P311–330 pre-absorption. Taken together, our results identify putative targets on endothelial cells recognized by anti-DV NS1 antibodies, where NS1 P311–330 possesses the shared epitope.

TI  - Re-evaluation of the pathogenic roles of nonstructural protein 1 and its antibodies during dengue virus infection
JF  - Journal of Biomedical Science
VL  - 20
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection can cause life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Vascular leakage and abnormal hemorrhage are the two major pathogenic changes found in these patients. From previous studies, it is known that both antibodies and cytokines induced in response to DENV infection are involved in the immunopathogenesis of DHF/DSS. However, the role of viral factors during DENV infection remains unclear. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), which is secreted in the sera of patients, is a useful diagnostic marker for acute DENV infection. Nevertheless, the roles of NS1 and its antibodies in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS are unclear. The focus of this review is to evaluate the possible contributions of NS1 and the antibodies it induces to vascular leakage and abnormal hemorrhage during DENV infection, which may provide clues to better understanding the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS.

TI  - Re-examination of the risk of autoimmune diseases after dengue virus infection: A population-based cohort study
JF  - PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 17
AB  - Previous studies suggested that dengue was associated with an increased risk of several autoimmune diseases. However, this association still needs to be explored due to the limitations of these studies. A population-based cohort study was conducted using national health databases in Taiwan and included 63,814 newly diagnosed, laboratory-confirmed dengue patients between 2002 and 2015 and 1:4 controls (n = 255,256) matched by age, sex, area of residence and symptom onset time. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the risk of autoimmune diseases after dengue infection. Dengue patients had a slightly higher risk of overall autoimmune diseases than non-dengue controls (aHR 1.16; P = 0.0002). Stratified analyses by specific autoimmune diseases showed that only autoimmune encephalomyelitis remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (aHR 2.72; P < 0.0001). Sixteen (0.025%) dengue patients and no (0%) controls developed autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the first month of follow-up (HR >9999, P < 0.0001), but the risk between groups was not significantly different thereafter. Contrary to previous studies, our findings showed that dengue was associated with an increased short-term risk of a rare complication, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, but not associated with other autoimmune diseases.

TI  - Resetting Immunoglobulin Paratope Memory for the Recognition of Antigenically Varying Dengue Viral Serotypes to Prevent Antibodydependent Enhancement of Infection
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - : The Dengue Virus (DENV) does not have any treatment or effective vaccine that can be used to target the infection. Development of an effective treatment or vaccine is difficult due to Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of infection. As antibodies are responsible for recognition of an infection, we attempt to understand the mechanism by which antibody memory is created. Based on a hypothesis for the process by which antibody memory is developed, we identify a method by which the memory can be reset to be antigen non-specific, where the antibody’s Paratope is unable to recognize the DENV antigen and reacts by forming a new structure in the Paratope.

TI  - Role of Dendritic Cells in Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Virus Infection
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 3939
EP  - 3951
AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue viruses (DV), composed of four distinct serotypes (DV1 to DV4), cause 50 to 100 million infections annually. Durable homotypic immunity follows infection but may predispose to severe subsequent heterotypic infections, a risk conferred in part by the immune response itself. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a process best described in vitro, is epidemiologically linked to complicated DV infections, especially in Southeast Asia. Here we report for the first time the ADE phenomenon in primary human dendritic cells (DC), early targets of DV infection, and human cell lines bearing Fc receptors. We show that ADE is inversely correlated with surface expression of DC-SIGN (DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin) and requires Fc gamma receptor IIa (FcγRIIa). Mature DC exhibited ADE, whereas immature DC, expressing higher levels of DC-SIGN and similar FcγRIIa levels, did not undergo ADE. ADE results in increased intracellular de novo DV protein synthesis, increased viral RNA production and release, and increased infectivity of the supernatants in mature DC. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6), but not IL-10 and gamma interferon, were released in the presence of dengue patient sera but generally only at enhancement titers, suggesting a signaling component of ADE. FcγRIIa inhibition with monoclonal antibodies abrogated ADE and associated downstream consequences. DV versatility in entry routes (FcγRIIa or DC-SIGN) in mature DC broadens target options and suggests additional ways for DC to contribute to the pathogenesis of severe DV infection. Studying the cellular targets of DV infection and their susceptibility to ADE will aid our understanding of complex disease and contribute to the field of vaccine development.

TI  - Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (Syk) Mediates IL-1β Induction by Primary Human Monocytes during Antibody-enhanced Dengue Virus Infection*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 290
SP  - 17306
EP  - 17320
AB  - Background: Insights into the mechanisms of elevated cytokine production during severe dengue disease are needed. Results: Dengue virus immune complexes induce inflammatory cytokine expression by activating spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) during antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Conclusion: Syk-mediated activation of ERK1/2 elevates cytokine production during antibody-enhanced dengue infection. Significance: Targeting Syk and ERK1/2 has therapeutic potential during antibody-enhanced dengue infection. Approximately 500,000 people are hospitalized with severe dengue illness annually. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus (DENV) infection is believed to contribute to the pathogenic cytokine storm described in severe dengue patients, but the precise signaling pathways contributing to elevated cytokine production are not elucidated. IL-1β is a potent inflammatory cytokine that is frequently elevated during severe dengue, and the unique dual regulation of IL-1β provides an informative model to study ADE-induced cytokines. This work utilizes patient-derived anti-DENV mAbs and primary human monocytes to study ADE-induced IL-1β and other cytokines. ADE of DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) elevates mature IL-1β secretion by monocytes independent of DENV replication by 4 h postinoculation (hpi). Prior to this, DENV immune complexes activate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) within 1 hpi. Syk induces elevated IL1B, TNF, and IL6 mRNA by 2 hpi. Syk mediates elevated IL-1β secretion by activating ERK1/2, and both Syk and ERK1/2 inhibitors ablated ADE-induced IL-1β secretion. Maturation of pro-IL-1β during ADE requires caspase-1 and NLRP3, but caspase-1 is suboptimally increased by ADE and can be significantly enhanced by a typical inflammasome agonist, ATP. Importantly, this inflammatory Syk-ERK signaling axis requires DENV immune complexes, because DENV-2 in the presence of serotype-matched anti-DENV-2 mAb, but not anti-DENV-1 mAb, activates Syk, ERK, and IL-1β secretion. This study provides evidence that DENV-2 immune complexes activate Syk to mediate elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines. Syk and ERK may serve as new therapeutic targets for interfering with ADE-induced cytokine expression during severe dengue.

TI  - Subversion of Innate Defenses by the Interplay between DENV and Pre-Existing Enhancing Antibodies: TLRs Signaling Collapse
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 4
AB  - Background The phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement as a major determinant that exacerbates disease severity in DENV infections is well accepted. While the detailed mechanism of antibody enhanced disease severity is unclear, evidence suggests that it is associated with both increased DENV infectivity and suppression of the type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. Therefore, it is imperative for us to understand the intracellular mechanisms altered during ADE infection to decipher the mechanism of severe pathogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings In this present work, qRT-PCR, immunoblotting and gene array analysis were conducted to determine whether DENV-antibody complex infection exerts a suppressive effect on the expression and/or function of the pathogen recognition patterns, focusing on the TLR-signaling pathway. We show here that FcγRI and FcγRIIa synergistically facilitated entry of DENV-antibody complexes into monocytic THP-1 cells. Ligation between DENV-antibody complexes and FcR not only down regulated TLRs gene expression but also up regulated SARM, TANK, and negative regulators of the NF-κB pathway, resulting in suppression of innate responses but increased viral production. These results were confirmed by blocking with anti-FcγRI or anti-FcγRIIa antibodies which reduced viral production, up-regulated IFN-β synthesis, and increased gene expression in the TLR-dependent signaling pathway. The negative impact of DENV-ADE infection on the TLR-dependent pathway was strongly supported by gene array screening which revealed that both MyD88-dependent and –independent signaling molecules were down regulated during DENV-ADE infection. Importantly, the same phenomenon was seen in PBMC of secondary DHF/DSS patients but not in PBMC of DF patients. Conclusions/Significance Our present work demonstrates the mechanism by which DENV uses pre-existing immune mediators to defeat the principal activating pathway of innate defense resulting in suppression of an array of innate immune responses. Interestingly, this phenomenon specifically occurred during the severe form of DENV infection but not in the mild form of disease.

TI  - Sulfated Polysaccharide, Curdlan Sulfate, Efficiently Prevents Entry/Fusion and Restricts Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Virus Infection In Vitro: A Possible Candidate for Clinical Application
JF  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
VL  - 7
AB  - Curdlan sulfate (CRDS), a sulfated 1→3-β-D glucan, previously shown to be a potent HIV entry inhibitor, is characterized in this study as a potent inhibitor of the Dengue virus (DENV). CRDS was identified by in silico blind docking studies to exhibit binding potential to the envelope (E) protein of the DENV. CRDS was shown to inhibit the DENV replication very efficiently in different cells in vitro. Minimal effective concentration of CRDS was as low as 0.1 µg/mL in LLC-MK2 cells, and toxicity was observed only at concentrations over 10 mg/mL. CRDS can also inhibit DENV-1, 3, and 4 efficiently. CRDS did not inhibit the replication of DENV subgenomic replicon. Time of addition experiments demonstrated that the compound not only inhibited viral infection at the host cell binding step, but also at an early post-attachment step of entry (membrane fusion). The direct binding of CRDS to DENV was suggested by an evident reduction in the viral titers after interaction of the virus with CRDS following an ultrafiltration device separation, as well as after virus adsorption to an alkyl CRDS-coated membrane filter. The electron microscopic features also showed that CRDS interacted directly with the viral envelope, and caused changes to the viral surface. CRDS also potently inhibited DENV infection in DC-SIGN expressing cells as well as the antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV-2 infection. Based on these data, a probable binding model of CRDS to DENV E protein was constructed by a flexible receptor and ligand docking study. The binding site of CRDS was predicted to be at the interface between domains II and III of E protein dimer, which is unique to this compound, and is apparently different from the β-OG binding site. Since CRDS has already been tested in humans without serious side effects, its clinical application can be considered.

TI  - Sustained antibody response to ZIKV infection induced by NS1 protein is accompanied by the progressive appearance of autoreactive antibodies and cross-reactive B cell clones
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Besides antigen-specific responses to viral antigens, humoral immune response in virus infection can generate polyreactive and autoreactive antibodies. Dengue and Zika virus infections have been linked to antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders including Guillain-Barrè syndrome. A unique feature of flaviviruses is the secretion of non-structural protein 1 (NS1) by infected cells. NS1 is highly immunogenic and antibodies targeting NS1 can have both protective and pathogenic roles. In the present study, we investigated the humoral immune response to Zika virus NS1 and found NS1 to be an immunodominant viral antigen associated with the presence of autoreactive antibodies. Through single B cell cultures, we coupled binding assays and BCR sequencing, confirming the immunodominance of NS1. Of note, we demonstrate the presence of self-reactive clones in germinal centers after both infection and immunization, some of which clones presenting cross-reactivity with NS1. Sequence analysis of anti-NS1 B cell clones showed sequence features associated with pathogenic autoreactive antibodies. Our findings demonstrate NS1 immunodominance at the cellular level as well as a potential role for NS1 in ZIKV associated autoimmune manifestations.

AB  - ABSTRACT Dengue virus infection mainly causes dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and/or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). However, ADE (antibody-dependent enhancement) is one of the main pathogenic factors, and its pathogenic mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Recently, with the development of high-throughput sequencing, an increased number of RNAs have been confirmed to play a vital regulatory role in the process of virus infection. However, there is a lack of research on dengue virus infection and ADE. In this study, we used RNA-Seq to detect differentially expressed RNAs (DE RNAs) profiles in mock-infected, DENV-3-infected, and ADE-infected THP-1 cells. Firstly, we found 69 circRNAs, 259 miRNAs, and 18 mRNAs were differentially expressed in THP-1 vs DENV-3. In THP-1 vs ADE, 94 circRNAs, 263 miRNAs, and 111 mRNAs were differentially expressed. In DENV-3 vs ADE, 68 circRNAs, 105 miRNAs, and 94 mRNAs were differentially expressed. Functional enrichment analysis of these DE RNAs mainly focused on immune system, viral infectious diseases, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and NOD/RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways. In DENV-3 vs ADE, notably, the expression of HBB was up-regulated, which was a Fcγ Receptor-mediated phagocytosis protein. Additionally, we predicted the encoding ability of DE circRNAs, and it was found that a small peptide was encoded by novel_circ_001562 and that its amino acid sequence was consistent with that of DDX60L, which is a class of interferon-stimulated genes. Finally, we constructed the ceRNA regulatory network pathway. Therefore, our study provides a new strategy for further investigation on DENV-host interactions.

AB  - The available evidence suggests that plasma leakage in dengue hemorrhagic fever is caused by the action of circulating mediators on the vascular endothelium, and that the host immune response is a critical determinant of this response. We have been exploring the role of dengue virus–specific T lymphocytes in the immunopathogenesis of plasma leakage. Memory dengue virus–specific T cells induced during a primary dengue virus infection are reactivated by the heterologous viral serotype during a secondary infection to expand to high levels and produce a skewed cytokine profile. Investigations are underway to identify the immunologic profiles associated with increased or decreased risk for severe disease.

JF  - Oncotarget
VL  - 8
SP  - 106050
EP  - 106070
AB  - Possible risk mediators in primary dengue virus (DenV) infection that favor secondary DenV infection to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and shock syndrome (DSS) via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) have not yet been described. Here, DenV infection enhanced the expression of inflammatory mediators and activation molecules in dendritic cells (DCs) through TLR2/MyD88 pathway. TLR2 appeared to facilitate DenV infection in DCs that were less permissive than macrophages for viral replication. In experiments using separate evaluations of DenV-infected and uninfected bystander DCs, infected DCs showed impaired maturation accompanied with TLR2-dependent production of inflammatory cytokines, by which uninfected bystander DCs showed increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Differential phosphorylation of MAPK and STAT3 was also detected between DenV-infected and uninfected DCs. Furthermore, DenV infection stimulated Th2-polarized humoral and cellular immunity against foreign and DenV Ag via TLR2/MyD88 pathway, and DenV-infected DCs were revealed to facilitate Th2-biased immune responses in TLR2-dependent manner. TLR2/MyD88-mediated Th2-biased Ab responses to primary DenV infection increased the infectivity of secondary homotypic or heterotypic DenV via ADE. Collectively, these results indicate that TLR2/MyD88 pathway in DC-priming receptors can drive Th2-biased immune responses during primary DenV infection, which could favor secondary DenV infection to DHF/DSS via ADE.

TI  - The Cytokine Response of U937-Derived Macrophages Infected through Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Virus Disrupts Cell Apical-Junction Complexes and Increases Vascular Permeability
JF  - Journal of Virology

AB  - ABSTRACT Severe dengue (SD) is a life-threatening complication of dengue that includes vascular permeability syndrome (VPS) and respiratory distress. Secondary infections are considered a risk factor for developing SD, presumably through a mechanism called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Despite extensive studies, the molecular bases of how ADE contributes to SD and VPS are largely unknown. This work compares the cytokine responses of differentiated U937 human monocytic cells infected directly with dengue virus (DENV) or in the presence of enhancing concentrations of a humanized monoclonal antibody recognizing protein E (ADE-DENV infection). Using a cytometric bead assay, ADE-DENV-infected cells were found to produce significantly higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-12p70, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), than cells directly infected. The capacity of conditioned supernatants (conditioned medium [CM]) to disrupt tight junctions (TJs) in MDCK cell cultures was evaluated. Exposure of MDCK cell monolayers to CM collected from ADE-DENV-infected cells (ADE-CM) but not from cells infected directly led to a rapid loss of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and to delocalization and degradation of apical-junction complex proteins. Depletion of either TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-12p70 from CM from ADE-DENV-infected cells fully reverted the disrupting effect on TJs. Remarkably, mice injected intraperitoneally with ADE-CM showed increased vascular permeability in sera and lungs, as indicated by an Evans blue quantification assay. These results indicate that the cytokine response of U937-derived macrophages to ADE-DENV infection shows an increased capacity to disturb TJs, while results obtained with the mouse model suggest that such a response may be related to the vascular plasma leakage characteristic of SD.

AB  - Using flow cytometric assay and monoclonal anti-dengue Ab, we observed that both anti-E and anti-prM Abs could enhance dengue virus infection in a concentration-dependent but serotype-independent manner. Increases were found in both the percentage of dengue-infected cells and the expression of dengue E and NS1 protein per cell. Dengue virion binding and infection were enhanced on FcR-bearing cells via the Fc-FcγRII pathway. Furthermore, anti-prM Ab also enhanced dengue virion binding and infection on cells lacking FcR, such as BHK-21 or A549 cells, by the mechanism of peptide (CPFLKQNEPEDIDCW)-specific binding. Anti-prM Ab cross-reacted with BHK-21 or A549 cells and recognized self-Ags such as heat shock protein 60. In summary, a novel mechanism of anti-prM Ab-mediated enhancement on dengue virus infection was found to be mediated by dual specific binding to dengue virion and to target cells, in addition to the traditional enhancement on FcR-bearing cells.

AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) are the causative agents of dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Here we review the current state of knowledge about the human antibody response to dengue and identify important knowledge gaps. A large body of work has demonstrated that antibodies can neutralize or enhance DENV infection. Investigators have mainly used mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to study interactions between DENV and antibodies. These studies indicate that antibody neutralization of DENVs is a “multi-hit” phenomenon that requires the binding of multiple antibodies to neutralize a virion. The most potently neutralizing mouse MAbs bind to surface exposed epitopes on domain III of the dengue envelope (E) protein. One challenge facing the dengue field now is to extend these studies with mouse MAbs to better understand the human antibody response. The human antibody response is complex as it involves a polyclonal response to primary and secondary infections with 4 different DENV serotypes. Here we review studies conducted with immune sera and MAbs isolated from people exposed to dengue infections. Most dengue-specific antibodies in human immune sera are weakly neutralizing and bind to multiple DENV serotypes. The human antibodies that potently and type specifically neutralize DENV represent a small fraction of the total DENV-specific antibody response. Moreover, these neutralizing antibodies appear to bind to novel epitopes including complex, quaternary epitopes that are only preserved on the intact virion. These studies establish that human and mouse antibodies recognize distinct epitopes on the dengue virion. The leading theory proposed to explain the increased risk of severe disease in secondary cases is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), which postulates that weakly neutralizing antibodies from the first infection bind to the second serotype and enhance infection of FcγR bearing myeloid cells such as monocytes and macrophages. Here we review results from human, animal and cell culture studies relevant to the ADE hypothesis. By understanding how human antibodies neutralize or enhance DENV, it will be possible to better evaluate existing vaccines and develop the next generation of novel vaccines.

TI  - The Role of Autophagy-Mediated Dengue Virus Antibody-Dependent Enhancement Infection of THP-1 Cells
JF  - Intervirology

SP  - 57
EP  - 65
AB  - Background: Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus (DENV) infection is identified as the main risk factor of severe dengue diseases. The underlying mechanisms leading to severe dengue fever remain unclear. Methods: THP-1 cells were treated with an autophagy inducer (rapamycin) or inhibitor (3-methyladenine [3-MA]) and infected with DENV and DENV-ADE. In order to investigate the expression profile of autophagy-related genes in DENV-ADE and DENV direct infection of THP-1 cells, the PCR array including 84 autophagy-related genes was selected to detect the expression of related genes, and then heat map and clustergram were established by analysis software to compare the expression differences of these genes between the DENV-ADE and DENV direct infection. Results: Autophagy-inducing complex related genes ATG5 and ATG12 were upregulated, and autophagosomes were also observed by transmission electron microscopy among DENV-ADE- and DENV-infected THP-1 cells, which indicated that autophagy was involved in dengue infection. The results show that 3-MA has a significant inhibitory effect on ATG12 in THP-1 cells; on the contrary, the expression of ATG12 was upregulated in THP-1 cells that were treated with rapamycin. The autophagy-related genes ESR1, INS, BNIP3, FAS, TGM2, ATG9B, and DAPK1 exhibited significant differences between DENV-ADE and DENV direct infection groups. Conclusion: In the present study, an additional mechanism of autophagy was inhibited by the autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) in DENV- and DENV-ADE-infected THP-1 cells. Our finding provided a clear link between autophagy and antibody-enhanced infection of DENV.

JF  - PLOS Pathogens
VL  - 19
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection caused by dengue virus (DENV) of the Flaviviridae family. There are four distinct serotypes, DENV-1,-2,-3,-4, which cause outbreaks globally. Infection is often self-resolving, and lifelong immunity against the infecting serotype can be achieved after exposure. However, in some individuals, homologous infection may still result in symptomatic dengue [1]. There is usually limited protection against heterotypic infections by three other DENV serotypes, as cross-protection is short-lived [2]. After this window of “protection”, subsequent infection with a different serotype may increase the risk of develop-ing severe dengue [3,4]. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in dengue, a process mainly mediated by immunoglobulin G (IgG), is believed to be one of the major underlying mechanisms leading to increased severity in secondary DENV infection. ADE was shown to enhance viral entry into immune cells via their Fc γ receptors (Fc γ R), which promotes viral replication, leading to increased viremia and pro-inflammatory responses. These contribute to disease pathologies including vascular hyperpermeability, a common cause

TI  - Vaccine-associated enhanced disease in humans and animal models: Lessons and challenges for vaccine development
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 13
AB  - The fight against infectious diseases calls for the development of safe and effective vaccines that generate long-lasting protective immunity. In a few situations, vaccine-mediated immune responses may have led to exacerbated pathology upon subsequent infection with the pathogen targeted by the vaccine. Such vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) has been reported, or at least suspected, in animal models, and in a few instances in humans, for vaccine candidates against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus (MV), dengue virus (DENV), HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although alleviated by clinical and epidemiological evidence, a number of concerns were also initially raised concerning the short- and long-term safety of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although the mechanisms leading to this phenomenon are not yet completely understood, the individual and/or collective role of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), complement-dependent enhancement, and cell-dependent enhancement have been highlighted. Here, we review mechanisms that may be associated with the risk of VAED, which are important to take into consideration, both in the assessment of vaccine safety and in finding ways to define models and immunization strategies that can alleviate such concerns.

TI  - Virus-Induced Pathogenic Antibodies: Lessons from Long COVID and Dengue Hemorrhage Fever
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 26
AB  - Virus-induced antibodies represent a dual-edged sword in the immune response to viral infections. While antibodies are critical for neutralizing pathogens, some can paradoxically exacerbate disease severity through mechanisms such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), autoantibody, and prolonged inflammation. Long coronavirus disease (COVID) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) exemplify conditions where pathogenic antibodies play a pivotal role in disease progression. Long COVID is associated with persistent immune dysregulation and autoantibody production, leading to chronic symptoms and tissue damage. In DHF, pre-existing antibodies against dengue virus contribute to ADE, amplifying viral replication, immune activation, and vascular permeability. This review explores the mechanisms underlying these pathogenic antibody responses, highlighting the shared pathways of immune dysregulation and comparing the distinct features of both conditions. By examining these studies, we identify key lessons for therapeutic strategies, vaccine design, and future research aimed at mitigating the severe outcomes of viral infections.

AB  - Zika virus has emerged in the Americas, where dengue virus is endemic. Among the 4 serotypes of dengue virus, antibody-dependent enhancement is thought to enhance viral replication and disease severity. Reports suggest that anti-dengue virus antibody may enhance Zika virus replication. We investigated whether Zika virus antibodies enhance dengue virus replication, by exposing C57Bl/6 mice to Zika virus. Polyclonal serum was verified for strong Zika virus-neutralizing, dengue virus-subneutralizing capacity. Then we determined the enhancement capabilities of Zika virus-immune serum for dengue virus in vitro. We showed that Zika virus antibodies have the ability to enhance dengue virus infections, which is important, because in many Zika virus-affected areas, dengue virus is expected to remain endemic.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are two major mosquito-borne flaviviruses that pose a significant threat to the global public health system, particularly in tropical regions. The clinical outcomes related to these viral pathogens can vary from self-limiting asymptomatic infections to various forms of life-threatening pathological conditions such as haemorrhagic disorders. In addition to the direct effects of the viral pathogens, immune processes play also a significant function in the development of diseases mediated by ZIKV and DENV. Studing these processes is important for developing safer vaccines and targeted therapeutic strategies. These viruses have been reported to trigger various autoimmune disorders affecting different parts of human organ systems. It also has been shown that preexisting immunity to ZIKV or DENV can impact the outcome of subsequent infections caused by another virus. ZIKV and DENV infection can promote the development of autoimmune disorders by different mechanisms, such as molecular mimicry and autoantibody formation. The present review provides an overview of various autoimmune disorders associated with ZIKV and DENV infection and their potential underlying mechanisms.
