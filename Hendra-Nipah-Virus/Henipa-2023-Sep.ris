TI  - A Conserved Region in the F2 Subunit of Paramyxovirus Fusion Proteins Is Involved In Fusion Regulation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 8303
EP  - 8314
AB  - ABSTRACT Paramyxoviruses utilize both an attachment protein and a fusion (F) protein to drive virus-cell and cell-cell fusion. F exists functionally as a trimer of two disulfide-linked subunits: F1 and F2. Alignment and analysis of a set of paramyxovirus F protein sequences identified three conserved blocks (CB): one in the fusion peptide/heptad repeat A domain, known to play important roles in fusion promotion, one in the region between the heptad repeats of F1 (CBF1) (A. E. Gardner, K. L. Martin, and R. E. Dutch, Biochemistry 46:5094-5105, 2007), and one in the F2 subunit (CBF2). To analyze the functions of CBF2, alanine substitutions at conserved positions were created in both the simian virus 5 (SV5) and Hendra virus F proteins. A number of the CBF2 mutations resulted in folding and expression defects. However, the CBF2 mutants that were properly expressed and trafficked had altered fusion promotion activity. The Hendra virus CBF2 Y79A and P89A mutants showed significantly decreased levels of fusion, whereas the SV5 CBF2 I49A mutant exhibited greatly increased cell-cell fusion relative to that for wild-type F. Additional substitutions at SV5 F I49 suggest that both side chain volume and hydrophobicity at this position are important in the folding of the metastable, prefusion state and the subsequent triggering of membrane fusion. The recently published prefusogenic structure of parainfluenza virus 5/SV5 F (H. S. Yin et al., Nature 439:38-44, 2006) places CBF2 in direct contact with heptad repeat A. Our data therefore indicate that this conserved region plays a critical role in stabilizing the prefusion state, likely through interactions with heptad repeat A, and in triggering membrane fusion.

TI  - A Hydrophobic Target: Using the Paramyxovirus Fusion Protein Transmembrane Domain To Modulate Fusion Protein Stability
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - Enveloped viruses require virus-cell membrane fusion to release the viral genome and replicate. The viral fusion protein triggers from the pre- to the postfusion conformation, an essentially irreversible change, to drive membrane fusion. We found that small proteins containing the TM and a limited flanking region homologous to the fusion protein of the zoonotic Hendra virus reduced protein expression and fusion activity. The introduction of exogenous TM peptides may displace a TM domain, disrupting native TM-TM interactions and globally destabilizing the fusion protein. Supporting this hypothesis, we showed that a sequence-specific transmembrane peptide dramatically reduced viral infection in another enveloped virus model, suggesting a broader inhibitory mechanism. Viral fusion protein TM-TM interactions are important for protein function, and disruption of these interactions dramatically reduces protein stability. ABSTRACT Enveloped viruses utilize surface glycoproteins to bind and fuse with a target cell membrane. The zoonotic Hendra virus (HeV), a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, utilizes the attachment protein (G) and the fusion protein (F) to perform these critical functions. Upon triggering, the trimeric F protein undergoes a large, irreversible conformation change to drive membrane fusion. Previously, we have shown that the transmembrane (TM) domain of the F protein, separate from the rest of the protein, is present in a monomer-trimer equilibrium. This TM-TM association contributes to the stability of the prefusion form of the protein, supporting a role for TM-TM interactions in the control of F protein conformational changes. To determine the impact of disrupting TM-TM interactions, constructs expressing the HeV F TM with limited flanking sequences were synthesized. Coexpression of these constructs with HeV F resulted in dramatic reductions in the stability of F protein expression and fusion activity. In contrast, no effects were observed when the HeV F TM constructs were coexpressed with the nonhomologous parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) fusion protein, indicating a requirement for specific interactions. To further examine this, a TM peptide homologous to the PIV5 F TM domain was synthesized. Addition of the peptide prior to infection inhibited infection with PIV5 but did not significantly affect infection with human metapneumovirus, a related virus. These results indicate that targeted disruption of TM-TM interactions significantly impact viral fusion protein stability and function, presenting these interactions as a novel target for antiviral development.

TI  - A Novel Factor I Activity in Nipah Virus Inhibits Human Complement Pathways through Cleavage of C3b
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 989
EP  - 998
AB  - ABSTRACT Complement is an innate immune system that most animal viruses must face during natural infections. Given that replication and dissemination of the highly pathogenic Nipah virus (NiV) include exposure to environments rich in complement factors, we tested the in vitro sensitivity of NiV to complement-mediated neutralization. Here we show that NiV was completely resistant to in vitro neutralization by normal human serum (NHS). Treatment of purified NiV with NHS activated complement pathways, but there was very little C3 deposition on virus particles. In in vitro reconstitution experiments, NiV particles provided time- and dose-dependent factor I-like protease activity capable of cleaving C3b into inactive C3b (iC3b). NiV-dependent inactivation of C3b only occurred with the cofactors factor H and soluble CR1 but not with CD46. Purified NiV particles did not support C4b cleavage. Electron microscopy of purified NiV particles showed immunogold labeling with anti-factor I antibodies. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which NiV evades the human complement system through a unique factor I-like activity. IMPORTANCE Viruses have evolved mechanisms to limit complement-mediated neutralization, some of which involve hijacking cellular proteins involved in control of inappropriate complement activation. Here we report a previously unknown mechanism whereby NiV provides a novel protease activity capable of in vitro cleavage and inactivation of C3b, a key component of the complement cascade. These data help to explain how an enveloped virus such as NiV can infect and disseminate through body fluids that are rich in complement activity. Disruption of the ability of NiV to recruit complement inhibitors could form the basis for the development of effective therapies and safer vaccines to combat these highly pathogenic emerging viruses.

TI  - A Novel Receptor-induced Activation Site in the Nipah Virus Attachment Glycoprotein (G) Involved in Triggering the Fusion Glycoprotein (F)*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 284
SP  - 1628
EP  - 1635
AB  - Cellular entry of paramyxoviruses requires the coordinated action of both the attachment (G/H/HN) and fusion (F) glycoproteins, but how receptor binding activates G to trigger F-mediated fusion during viral entry is not known. Here, we identify a receptor (ephrinB2)-induced allosteric activation site in Nipah virus (NiV) G involved in triggering F-mediated fusion. We first generated a conformational monoclonal antibody (monoclonal antibody 45 (Mab45)) whose binding to NiV-G was enhanced upon NiV-G-ephrinB2 binding. However, Mab45 also inhibited viral entry, and its receptor binding-enhanced (RBE) epitope was temperature-dependent, suggesting that the Mab45 RBE epitope on G may be involved in triggering F. The Mab45 RBE epitope was mapped to the base of the globular domain (Œ≤6S4/Œ≤1H1). Alanine scan mutants within this region that did not exhibit this RBE epitope were also non-fusogenic despite their ability to bind ephrinB2, oligomerize, and associate with F at wild-type (WT) levels. Although circular dichroism revealed conformational changes in the soluble ectodomain of WT NiV-G upon ephrinB2 addition, no such changes were detected with soluble RBE epitope mutants or short-stalk G mutants. Additionally, WT G, but not a RBE epitope mutant, could dissociate from F upon ephrinB2 engagement. Finally, using a biotinylated HR2 peptide to detect pre-hairpin intermediate formation, a cardinal feature of F-triggering, we showed that ephrinB2 binding to WT G, but not the RBE-epitope mutants, could trigger F. In sum, we implicate the coordinated interaction between the base of NiV-G globular head domain and the stalk domain in mediating receptor-induced F triggering during viral entry.

TI  - A Quantitative and Kinetic Fusion Protein-Triggering Assay Can Discern Distinct Steps in the Nipah Virus Membrane Fusion Cascade
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 8033
EP  - 8041
AB  - ABSTRACT The deadly paramyxovirus Nipah virus (NiV) contains a fusion glycoprotein (F) with canonical structural and functional features common to its class. Receptor binding to the NiV attachment glycoprotein (G) triggers F to undergo a two-phase conformational cascade: the first phase progresses from a metastable prefusion state to a prehairpin intermediate (PHI), while the second phase is marked by transition from the PHI to the six-helix-bundle hairpin. The PHI can be captured with peptides that mimic F's heptad repeat regions, and here we utilized a NiV heptad repeat peptide to quantify PHI formation and the half-lives (t1/2) of the first and second fusion cascade phases. We found that ephrinB2 receptor binding to G triggered ‚àº2-fold more F than that triggered by ephrinB3, consistent with the increased rate and extent of fusion observed with ephrinB2- versus ephrinB3-expressing cells. In addition, for a series of hyper- and hypofusogenic F mutants, we quantified F-triggering capacities and measured the kinetics of their fusion cascade phases. Hyper- and hypofusogenicity can each be manifested through distinct stages of the fusion cascade, giving rise to vastly different half-lives for the first (t1/2, 1.9 to 7.5 min) or second (t1/2, 1.5 to 15.6 min) phase. While three mutants had a shorter first phase and a longer second phase than the wild-type protein, one mutant had the opposite phenotype. Thus, our results reveal multiple critical parameters that govern the paramyxovirus fusion cascade, and our assays should help efforts to elucidate other class I membrane fusion processes.

AB  - Understanding and defending against pathogenic viruses is an important public health and biodefense challenge. The focus of our LDRD project has been to uncover the mechanisms enveloped viruses use to identify and invade host cells. We have constructed interfaces between viral particles and synthetic lipid bilayers. This approach provides a minimal setting for investigating the initial events of host-virus interaction - (i) recognition of, and (ii) entry into the host via membrane fusion. This understanding could enable rational design of therapeutics that block viral entry as well as future construction of synthetic, non-proliferating sensors that detect live virus in the environment. We have observed fusion between synthetic lipid vesicles and Vesicular Stomatitis virus particles, and we have observed interactions between Nipah virus-like particles and supported lipid bilayers and giant unilamellar vesicles.

TI  - A conserved region between the heptad repeats of paramyxovirus fusion proteins is critical for proper F protein folding.
JF  - Biochemistry
VL  - 46 17
SP  - 5094
EP  - 105
AB  - Paramyxoviruses are a diverse family that utilizes a fusion (F) protein to enter cells via fusion of the viral lipid bilayer with a target cell membrane. Although certain regions of the F protein are known to play critical roles in membrane fusion, the function of much of the protein remains unclear. Sequence alignment of a set of paramyxovirus F proteins and analysis utilizing Block Maker identified a region of conserved amino acid sequence in a large domain between the heptad repeats of F1, designated CBF1. We employed site-directed mutagenesis to analyze the function of completely conserved residues of CBF1 in both the simian virus 5 (SV5) and Hendra virus F proteins. The majority of CBF1 point mutants were deficient in homotrimer formation, proteolytic processing, and transport to the cell surface. For some SV5 F mutants, proteolytic cleavage and surface expression could be restored by expression at 30 degrees C, and varying levels of fusion promotion were observed at this temperature. In addition, the mutant SV5 F V402A displayed a hyperfusogenic phenotype at both 30 and 37 degrees C, indicating that this mutation allows for efficient fusion with only an extremely small amount of cleaved, active protein. The recently published prefusogenic structure of PIV5/SV5 F (Yin, H. S., et al. (2006) Nature 439, 38-44) indicates that residues within and flanking CBF1 interact with the fusion peptide domain. Together, these data suggest that CBF1-fusion peptide interactions are critical for the initial folding of paramyxovirus F proteins from this important viral family and can also modulate subsequent membrane fusion promotion.

TI  - A key region of molecular specificity orchestrates unique ephrin-B1 utilization by Cedar virus
JF  - Life Science Alliance
VL  - 3
AB  - An expanded hydrophobic cavity within the structurally constrained receptor-binding site of the Cedar virus attachment glycoprotein facilitates idiosyncratic utilization of ephrin-B1. The emergent zoonotic henipaviruses, Hendra, and Nipah are responsible for frequent and fatal disease outbreaks in domestic animals and humans. Specificity of henipavirus attachment glycoproteins (G) for highly species-conserved ephrin ligands underpins their broad host range and is associated with systemic and neurological disease pathologies. Here, we demonstrate that Cedar virus (CedV)‚Äîa related henipavirus that is ostensibly nonpathogenic‚Äîpossesses an idiosyncratic entry receptor repertoire that includes the common henipaviral receptor, ephrin-B2, but, distinct from pathogenic henipaviruses, does not include ephrin-B3. Uniquely among known henipaviruses, CedV can use ephrin-B1 for cellular entry. Structural analyses of CedV-G reveal a key region of molecular specificity that directs ephrin-B1 utilization, while preserving a universal mode of ephrin-B2 recognition. The structural and functional insights presented uncover diversity within the known henipavirus receptor repertoire and suggest that only modest structural changes may be required to modulate receptor specificities within this group of lethal human pathogens.

JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 3649
EP  - 3653
AB  - The V protein of the paramyxovirus Nipah virus (NiV) has been shown to antagonize the interferon (IFN) response in human cells via sequestration of STAT1 and STAT2. This study describes a mutant of the NiV V protein, referred to as V(AAHL), that is unable to antagonize IFN signalling and demonstrates that a single amino acid substitution is responsible for its inactivity. The molecular basis for this was identified as a failure to interact with STAT1 and STAT2. It was also shown that NiV V, but not V(AAHL), was functional as an IFN antagonist in human, monkey, rabbit, dog, horse, pig and bat cells, which suggests that the ability of NiV to block IFN signalling is not a major constraint that prevents this virus from crossing species barriers.

TI  - A strategy to suppress STAT1 signalling conserved in pathogenic poxviruses and paramyxoviruses
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The induction of interferon-stimulated genes by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, is a critical host defence to fight virus infections. Here, a highly expressed poxvirus protein 018 is shown to inhibit IFN-induced signalling by binding the SH2 domain of STAT1 to prevent STAT1 association with an activated IFN receptor. Despite the presence of additional inhibitors of IFN-induced signalling, a poxvirus lacking 018 was attenuated in mice. The 2.0 √Ö crystal structure of the 018:STAT1 complex reveals a mechanism for a high-affinity, pTyr-independent mode of binding to an SH2 domain. Furthermore, the STAT1 binding motif of 018 shows sequence similarity to the STAT1-binding proteins from Nipah virus, which like 018, block the association of STAT1 with an IFN receptor. Taken together, these results provide detailed mechanistic insight into a potent mode of STAT1 antagonism, found to exist in genetically diverse virus families.

TI  - ANP32B Is a Nuclear Target of Henipavirus M Proteins
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - Membrane envelopment and budding of negative strand RNA viruses (NSVs) is mainly driven by viral matrix proteins (M). In addition, several M proteins are also known to be involved in host cell manipulation. Knowledge about the cellular targets and detailed molecular mechanisms, however, is poor for many M proteins. For instance, Nipah Virus (NiV) M protein trafficking through the nucleus is essential for virus release, but nuclear targets of NiV M remain unknown. To identify cellular interactors of henipavirus M proteins, tagged Hendra Virus (HeV) M proteins were expressed and M-containing protein complexes were isolated and analysed. Presence of acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member B (ANP32B) in the complex suggested that this protein represents a direct or indirect interactor of the viral matrix protein. Over-expression of ANP32B led to specific nuclear accumulation of HeV M, providing a functional link between ANP32B and M protein. ANP32B-dependent nuclear accumulation was observed after plasmid-driven expression of HeV and NiV matrix proteins and also in NiV infected cells. The latter indicated that an interaction of henipavirus M protein with ANP32B also occurs in the context of virus replication. From these data we conclude that ANP32B is a nuclear target of henipavirus M that may contribute to virus replication. Potential effects of ANP32B on HeV nuclear shuttling and host cell manipulation by HeV M affecting ANP32B functions in host cell survival and gene expression regulation are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Proteolytic activation of the fusion protein of the highly pathogenic Nipah virus (NiV F) is a prerequisite for the production of infectious particles and for virus spread via cell-to-cell fusion. Unlike other paramyxoviral fusion proteins, functional NiV F activation requires endocytosis and pH-dependent cleavage at a monobasic cleavage site by endosomal proteases. Using prototype Vero cells, cathepsin L was previously identified to be a cleavage enzyme. Compared to Vero cells, MDCK cells showed substantially higher F cleavage rates in both NiV-infected and NiV F-transfected cells. Surprisingly, this could not be explained either by an increased F endocytosis rate or by elevated cathepsin L activities. On the contrary, MDCK cells did not display any detectable cathepsin L activity. Though we could confirm cathepsin L to be responsible for F activation in Vero cells, inhibitor studies revealed that in MDCK cells, cathepsin B was required for F-protein cleavage and productive replication of pathogenic NiV. Supporting the idea of an efficient F cleavage in early and recycling endosomes of MDCK cells, endocytosed F proteins and cathepsin B colocalized markedly with the endosomal marker proteins early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA-1), Rab4, and Rab11, while NiV F trafficking through late endosomal compartments was not needed for F activation. In summary, this study shows for the first time that endosomal cathepsin B can play a functional role in the activation of highly pathogenic NiV.

TI  - Acute experimental infection of bats and ferrets with Hendra virus: Insights into the early host response of the reservoir host and susceptible model species
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 16
AB  - Bats are the natural reservoir host for a number of zoonotic viruses, including Hendra virus (HeV) which causes severe clinical disease in humans and other susceptible hosts. Our understanding of the ability of bats to avoid clinical disease following infection with viruses such as HeV has come predominantly from in vitro studies focusing on innate immunity. Information on the early host response to infection in vivo is lacking and there is no comparative data on responses in bats compared with animals that succumb to disease. In this study, we examined the sites of HeV replication and the immune response of infected Australian black flying foxes and ferrets at 12, 36 and 60 hours post exposure (hpe). Viral antigen was detected at 60 hpe in bats and was confined to the lungs whereas in ferrets there was evidence of widespread viral RNA and antigen by 60 hpe. The mRNA expression of IFNs revealed antagonism of type I and III IFNs and a significant increase in the chemokine, CXCL10, in bat lung and spleen following infection. In ferrets, there was an increase in the transcription of IFN in the spleen following infection. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on lung tissue from bats and ferrets was performed at 0 and 60 hpe to obtain a global overview of viral and host protein expression. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of immune pathways revealed that six pathways, including a number involved in cell mediated immunity were more likely to be upregulated in bat lung compared to ferrets. GO analysis also revealed enrichment of the type I IFN signaling pathway in bats and ferrets. This study contributes important comparative data on differences in the dissemination of HeV and the first to provide comparative data on the activation of immune pathways in bats and ferrets in vivo following infection.

TI  - Analysis of Cathepsin and Furin Proteolytic Enzymes Involved in Viral Fusion Protein Activation in Cells of the Bat Reservoir Host
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 10
AB  - Bats of different species play a major role in the emergence and transmission of highly pathogenic viruses including Ebola virus, SARS-like coronavirus and the henipaviruses. These viruses require proteolytic activation of surface envelope glycoproteins needed for entry, and cellular cathepsins have been shown to be involved in proteolysis of glycoproteins from these distinct virus families. Very little is currently known about the available proteases in bats. To determine whether the utilization of cathepsins by bat-borne viruses is related to the nature of proteases in their natural hosts, we examined proteolytic processing of several viral fusion proteins in cells derived from two fruit bat species, Pteropus alecto and Rousettus aegyptiacus. Our work shows that fruit bat cells have homologs of cathepsin and furin proteases capable of cleaving and activating both the cathepsin-dependent Hendra virus F and the furin-dependent parainfluenza virus 5 F proteins. Sequence analysis comparing Pteropus alecto furin and cathepsin L to proteases from other mammalian species showed a high degree of conservation; however significant amino acid variation occurs at the C-terminus of Pteropus alecto furin. Further analysis of furin-like proteases from fruit bats revealed that these proteases are catalytically active and resemble other mammalian furins in their response to a potent furin inhibitor. However, kinetic analysis suggests that differences may exist in the cellular localization of furin between different species. Collectively, these results indicate that the unusual role of cathepsin proteases in the life cycle of bat-borne viruses is not due to the lack of active furin-like proteases in these natural reservoir species; however, differences may exist between furin proteases present in fruit bats compared to furins in other mammalian species, and these differences may impact protease usage for viral glycoprotein processing.

TI  - Analysis of Hendra Virus Fusion Protein N-Terminal Transmembrane Residues
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Hendra virus (HeV) is a zoonotic enveloped member of the family Paramyoxviridae. To successfully infect a host cell, HeV utilizes two surface glycoproteins: the attachment (G) protein to bind, and the trimeric fusion (F) protein to merge the viral envelope with the membrane of the host cell. The transmembrane (TM) region of HeV F has been shown to have roles in F protein stability and the overall trimeric association of F. Previously, alanine scanning mutagenesis has been performed on the C-terminal end of the protein, revealing the importance of Œ≤-branched residues in this region. Additionally, residues S490 and Y498 have been demonstrated to be important for F protein endocytosis, needed for the proteolytic processing of F required for fusion. To complete the analysis of the HeV F TM, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis to explore the residues in the N-terminus of this region (residues 487‚Äì506). In addition to confirming the critical roles for S490 and Y498, we demonstrate that mutations at residues M491 and L492 alter F protein function, suggesting a role for these residues in the fusion process.

TI  - Analysis of Nipah Virus Replication and Host Proteome Response Patterns in Differentiated Porcine Airway Epithelial Cells Cultured at the Air‚ÄìLiquid Interface
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Respiratory tract epithelium infection plays a primary role in Nipah virus (NiV) pathogenesis and transmission. Knowledge about infection dynamics and host responses to NiV infection in respiratory tract epithelia is scarce. Studies in non-differentiated primary respiratory tract cells or cell lines indicate insufficient interferon (IFN) responses. However, studies are lacking in the determination of complex host response patterns in differentiated respiratory tract epithelia for the understanding of NiV replication and spread in swine. Here we characterized infection and spread of NiV in differentiated primary porcine bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC) cultivated at the air‚Äìliquid interface (ALI). After the initial infection of only a few apical cells, lateral spread for 12 days with epithelium disruption was observed without releasing substantial amounts of infectious virus from the apical or basal sides. Deep time course proteomics revealed pronounced upregulation of genes related to type I/II IFN, immunoproteasomal subunits, transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)-mediated peptide transport, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I antigen presentation. Spliceosomal factors were downregulated. We propose a model in which NiV replication in PBEC is slowed by a potent and broad type I/II IFN host response with conversion from 26S proteasomes to immunoproteasomal antigen processing and improved MHC I presentation for adaptive immunity priming. NiV induced cytopathic effects could reflect the focal release of cell-associated NiV, which may contribute to efficient airborne viral spread between pigs.

EP  - 29a
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are zoonotic henipaviruses (HNVs) responsible for outbreaks of encephalitis and respiratory illness. The entry of HNVs into host cells requires the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins, which are the main targets of antibody responses. To understand viral infection and host immunity, we determined a cryo‚Äìelectron microscopy structure of the NiV G homotetrameric ectodomain in complex with the nAH1.3 broadly neutralizing antibody Fab fragment. We show that a cocktail of two nonoverlapping G-specific antibodies neutralizes NiV and HeV synergistically and limits the emergence of escape mutants. Analysis of polyclonal serum antibody responses elicited by vaccination of macaques with NiV G indicates that the receptor binding head domain is immunodominant. These results pave the way for implementing multipronged therapeutic strategies against these deadly pathogens. Description Targeting Nipah virus The zoonotic Nipah virus (NiV) was discovered in 1999, and since then outbreaks in humans have been recorded almost annually in parts of Asia. This virus causes encephalitis and respiratory symptoms that can be serious and often fatal. Viral entry into host cells requires the attachment glycoprotein (G) and the fusion glycoprotein (F), and these proteins are targeted by the immune system. Z. Wang et al. determined the structure of the tetrameric ectodomain of the NiV G protein in complex with a broadly neutralizing antibody. Vaccinating macaques with the ectodomain tetramer elicited antibodies against the G protein head domain, resulting in potent neutralizing activity against NiV. The structure provides a blueprint for engineering next-generation vaccine candidates. ‚ÄîVV A structure of the Nipah virus G glycoprotein provides a blueprint for the design of next-generation vaccines.

JF  - Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics
VL  - 31
SP  - 453
EP  - 471
AB  - This work aims at characterizing structural transitions within the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of the nucleoprotein (NTAIL) from the Nipah and Hendra viruses, two recently emerged pathogens gathered within the Henipavirus genus. To this end, we used site-directed spin labeling combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate the Œ±-helical-induced folding that Henipavirus NTAIL domains undergo in the presence of the C-terminal X domain of the phosphoprotein (PXD). For each NTAIL protein, six positions located within four previously proposed molecular recognition elements (MoREs) were targeted for spin labeling, with three of these positions (475, 481, and 487) falling within the MoRE responsible for binding to PXD (Box3). A detailed analysis of the impact of the partner protein on the labeled NTAIL variants revealed a dramatic modification in the environment of the spin labels grafted within Box3, with the observed modifications supporting the formation of an induced Œ±-helix within this region. In the free state, the slightly lower mobility of the spin labels grafted within Box3 as compared to the other positions suggests the existence of a transiently populated Œ±-helix, as already reported for measles virus (MeV) NTAIL. Comparison with the well-characterized MeV NTAIL‚ÄìPXD system, allowed us to validate the structural models of Henipavirus NTAIL‚ÄìPXD complexes that we previously proposed. In addition, this study highlighted a few notable differences between the Nipah and Hendra viruses. In particular, the observation of composite spectra for the free form of the Nipah virus NTAIL variants spin labeled in Box3 supports conformational heterogeneity of this partly pre-configured Œ±-helix, with the pre-existence of stable Œ±-helical segments. Altogether these results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of the Henipavirus NTAIL‚ÄìPXD binding reaction.

TI  - Atomic Resolution Description of the Interaction between the Nucleoprotein and Phosphoprotein of Hendra Virus
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 9
AB  - Hendra virus (HeV) is a recently emerged severe human pathogen that belongs to the Henipavirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family. The HeV genome is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N) within a helical nucleocapsid. Recruitment of the viral polymerase onto the nucleocapsid template relies on the interaction between the C-terminal domain, NTAIL, of N and the C-terminal X domain, XD, of the polymerase co-factor phosphoprotein (P). Here, we provide an atomic resolution description of the intrinsically disordered NTAIL domain in its isolated state and in intact nucleocapsids using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Using electron microscopy, we show that HeV nucleocapsids form herringbone-like structures typical of paramyxoviruses. We also report the crystal structure of XD of P that consists of a three-helix bundle. We study the interaction between NTAIL and XD using NMR titration experiments and provide a detailed mapping of the reciprocal binding sites. We show that the interaction is accompanied by Œ±-helical folding of the molecular recognition element of NTAIL upon binding to a hydrophobic patch on the surface of XD. Finally, using solution NMR, we investigate the interaction between intact nucleocapsids and XD. Our results indicate that monomeric XD binds to NTAIL without triggering an additional unwinding of the nucleocapsid template. The present results provide a structural description at the atomic level of the protein-protein interactions required for transcription and replication of HeV, and the first direct observation of the interaction between the X domain of P and intact nucleocapsids in Paramyxoviridae.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86

EP  - 3013
AB  - ABSTRACT While work with viral fusion proteins has demonstrated that the transmembrane domain (TMD) can affect protein folding, stability, and membrane fusion promotion, the mechanism(s) remains poorly understood. TMDs could play a role in fusion promotion through direct TMD-TMD interactions, and we have recently shown that isolated TMDs from three paramyxovirus fusion (F) proteins interact as trimers using sedimentation equilibrium (SE) analysis (E. C. Smith, et al., submitted for publication). Immediately N-terminal to the TMD is heptad repeat B (HRB), which plays critical roles in fusion. Interestingly, addition of HRB decreased the stability of the trimeric TMD-TMD interactions. This result, combined with previous findings that HRB forms a trimeric coiled coil in the prefusion form of the whole protein though HRB peptides fail to stably associate in isolation, suggests that the trimeric TMD-TMD interactions work in concert with elements in the F ectodomain head to stabilize a weak HRB interaction. Thus, changes in TMD-TMD interactions could be important in regulating F triggering and refolding. Alanine insertions between the TMD and HRB demonstrated that spacing between these two regions is important for protein stability while not affecting TMD-TMD interactions. Additional mutagenesis of the C-terminal end of the TMD suggests that Œ≤-branched residues within the TMD play a role in membrane fusion, potentially through modulation of TMD-TMD interactions. Our results support a model whereby the C-terminal end of the Hendra virus F TMD is an important regulator of TMD-TMD interactions and show that these interactions help hold HRB in place prior to the triggering of membrane fusion.

EP  - 11471
AB  - ABSTRACT The henipaviruses, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), are paramyxoviruses discovered in the mid- to late 1990s that possess a broad host tropism and are known to cause severe and often fatal disease in both humans and animals. HeV and NiV infect cells by a pH-independent membrane fusion mechanism facilitated by their attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. Here, several soluble forms of henipavirus F (sF) were engineered and characterized. Recombinant sF was produced by deleting the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) domains and appending a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor signal sequence followed by GPI-phospholipase D digestion, appending a trimeric coiled-coil (GCNt) domain (sFGCNt), or deleting the TM, CT, and fusion peptide domain. These sF glycoproteins were produced as F0 precursors, and all were apparent stable trimers recognized by NiV-specific antisera. Surprisingly, however, only the GCNt-appended constructs (sFGCNt) could elicit cross-reactive henipavirus-neutralizing antibody in mice. In addition, sFGCNt constructs could be triggered in vitro by protease cleavage and heat to transition from an apparent prefusion to postfusion conformation, transitioning through an intermediate that could be captured by a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal heptad repeat domain of F. The pre- and postfusion structures of sFGCNt and non-GCNt-appended sF could be revealed by electron microscopy and were distinguishable by F-specific monoclonal antibodies. These data suggest that only certain sF constructs could serve as potential subunit vaccine immunogens against henipaviruses and also establish important tools for further structural, functional, and diagnostic studies on these important emerging viruses.

TI  - C-Terminal DxD-Containing Sequences within Paramyxovirus Nucleocapsid Proteins Determine Matrix Protein Compatibility and Can Direct Foreign Proteins into Budding Particles
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 3650
EP  - 3660
AB  - ABSTRACT Paramyxovirus particles are formed by a budding process coordinated by viral matrix (M) proteins. M proteins coalesce at sites underlying infected cell membranes and induce other viral components, including viral glycoproteins and viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs), to assemble at these locations from which particles bud. M proteins interact with the nucleocapsid (NP or N) components of vRNPs, and these interactions enable production of infectious, genome-containing virions. For the paramyxoviruses parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) and mumps virus, M-NP interaction also contributes to efficient production of virus-like particles (VLPs) in transfected cells. A DLD sequence near the C-terminal end of PIV5 NP protein was previously found to be necessary for M-NP interaction and efficient VLP production. Here, we demonstrate that 15-residue-long, DLD-containing sequences derived from either the PIV5 or Nipah virus nucleocapsid protein C-terminal ends are sufficient to direct packaging of a foreign protein, Renilla luciferase, into budding VLPs. Mumps virus NP protein harbors DWD in place of the DLD sequence found in PIV5 NP protein, and consequently, PIV5 NP protein is incompatible with mumps virus M protein. A single amino acid change converting DLD to DWD within PIV5 NP protein induced compatibility between these proteins and allowed efficient production of mumps VLPs. Our data suggest a model in which paramyxoviruses share an overall common strategy for directing M-NP interactions but with important variations contained within DLD-like sequences that play key roles in defining M/NP protein compatibilities. IMPORTANCE Paramyxoviruses are responsible for a wide range of diseases that affect both humans and animals. Paramyxovirus pathogens include measles virus, mumps virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, and the zoonotic paramyxoviruses Nipah virus and Hendra virus. Infectivity of paramyxovirus particles depends on matrix-nucleocapsid protein interactions which enable efficient packaging of encapsidated viral RNA genomes into budding virions. In this study, we have defined regions near the C-terminal ends of paramyxovirus nucleocapsid proteins that are important for matrix protein interaction and that are sufficient to direct a foreign protein into budding particles. These results advance our basic understanding of paramyxovirus genome packaging interactions and also have implications for the potential use of virus-like particles as protein delivery tools.

TI  - C-terminal tyrosine residues modulate the fusion activity of the Hendra virus fusion protein.
JF  - Biochemistry
VL  - 50 6
SP  - 945
EP  - 52
AB  - The paramyxovirus family includes important human pathogens such as measles, mumps, respiratory syncytial virus, and the recently emerged, highly pathogenic Hendra and Nipah viruses. The viral fusion (F) protein plays critical roles in infection, promoting both the virus-cell membrane fusion events needed for viral entry as well as cell-cell fusion events leading to syncytia formation. We describe the surprising finding that addition of the short epitope HA tag to the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of the Hendra virus F protein leads to a significant increase in the extent of cell-cell membrane fusion. This increase was not due to alterations in surface expression, cleavage state, or association with lipid microdomains. Addition of a Myc tag of similar length did not alter Hendra F protein fusion activity, indicating that the observed stimulation was not solely a result of lengthening the CT. Three tyrosine residues within the HA tag were critical for the increase in the extent of fusion, suggesting C-terminal tyrosines may modulate Hendra fusion activity. The effects of addition of the HA tag varied with other fusion proteins, as parainfluenza virus 5 F-HA showed a decreased level of surface expression and no stimulation of fusion. These results indicate that additions to the C-terminal end of the F protein CT can modulate protein function in a sequence specific manner, reinforcing the need for careful analysis of epitope-tagged glycoproteins. In addition, our results implicate C-terminal tyrosine residues in the modulation of the membrane fusion reaction promoted by these viral glycoproteins.

AB  - Background: Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging paramyxovirus distinguished by its ability to cause fatal disease in both animal and human hosts. Together with Hendra virus (HeV), they comprise the genus Henipavirus in the Paramyxoviridae family. NiV and HeV are also restricted to Biosafety Level4 containment and this has hampered progress towards examining details of their replication and morphogenesis. Here, we have established recombinant expression systems to study NiV particle assembly and budding through the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs). Results: When expressed by recombinant Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA) or plasmid transfection, individual NiV matrix (M), fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins were all released into culture supernatants in a membrane-associated state as determined by sucrose density gradient flotation and immunoprecipitation. However, co-expression of F and G along with M revealed a shift in their distribution across the gradient, indicating association with M in VLPs. Protein release was also altered depending on the context of viral proteins being expressed, with F, G and nucleocapsid (N) protein reducing M release, and N release dependent on the coexpression of M. Immunoelectron microscopy and density analysis revealed VLPs that were similar to authentic virus. Differences in the budding dynamics of NiV proteins were also noted between rMVA and plasmid based strategies, suggesting that over-expression by poxvirus may not be appropriate for studying the details of recombinant virus particle assembly and release. Conclusion: Taken together, the results indicate that NiV M, F, and G each possess some ability to bud from expressing cells, and that co-expression of these viral proteins results in a more organized budding process with M playing a central role. These findings will aid our understanding of paramyxovirus particle assembly in general and could help facilitate the development of a novel vaccine approach for henipaviruses.

TI  - Cathepsin L Is Involved in Proteolytic Processing of the Hendra Virus Fusion Protein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 12714
EP  - 12720
AB  - ABSTRACT Proteolytic processing of paramyxovirus fusion (F) proteins is essential for the generation of a mature and fusogenic form of the F protein. Although many paramyxovirus F proteins are proteolytically processed by the cellular protease furin at a multibasic cleavage motif, cleavage of the newly emerged Hendra virus F protein occurs by a previously unidentified cellular protease following a single lysine at residue 109. We demonstrate here that the cellular protease cathepsin L is involved in converting the Hendra virus precursor F protein (F0) to the active F1 + F2 disulfide-linked heterodimer. To initially identify the class of protease involved in Hendra virus F protein cleavage, Vero cells transfected with pCAGGS-Hendra F or pCAGGS-SV5 F (known to be proteolytically processed by furin) were metabolically labeled and chased in the absence or presence of serine, cysteine, aspartyl, and metalloprotease inhibitors. Nonspecific and specific protease inhibitors known to decrease cathepsin activity inhibited proteolytic processing of Hendra virus F but had no effect on simian virus 5 F processing. We next designed shRNA oligonucleotides to cathepsin L which dramatically reduced cathepsin L protein expression and enzyme activity. Cathepsin L shRNA-expressing Vero cells transfected with pCAGGS-Hendra F demonstrated a nondetectable amount of cleavage of the Hendra virus F protein and significantly decreased membrane fusion activity. Additionally, we found that purified human cathepsin L processed immunopurified Hendra virus F0 into F1 and F2 fragments. These studies introduce a novel mechanism for primary proteolytic processing of viral glycoproteins and also suggest a previously unreported biological role for cathepsin L.

TI  - Characterization of African bat henipavirus GH-M74a glycoproteins.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 95 Pt 3
SP  - 539
EP  - 48
AB  - In recent years, novel henipavirus-related sequences have been identified in bats in Africa. To evaluate the potential of African bat henipaviruses to spread in non-bat mammalian cells, we compared the biological functions of the surface glycoproteins G and F of the prototype African henipavirus GH-M74a with those of the glycoproteins of Nipah virus (NiV), a well-characterized pathogenic member of the henipavirus genus. Glycoproteins are central determinants for virus tropism, as efficient binding of henipavirus G proteins to cellular ephrin receptors and functional expression of fusion-competent F proteins are indispensable prerequisites for virus entry and cell-to-cell spread. In this study, we analysed the ability of the GH-M74a G and F proteins to cause cell-to-cell fusion in mammalian cell types readily permissive to NiV or Hendra virus infections. Except for limited syncytium formation in a bat cell line derived from Hypsignathus monstrosus, HypNi/1.1 cells, we did not observe any fusion. The highly restricted fusion activity was predominantly due to the F protein. Whilst GH-M74a G protein was found to interact with the main henipavirus receptor ephrin-B2 and induced syncytia upon co-expression with heterotypic NiV F protein, GH-M74a F protein did not cause evident fusion in the presence of heterotypic NiV G protein. Pulse-chase and surface biotinylation analyses revealed delayed F cleavage kinetics with a reduced expression of cleaved and fusion-active GH-M74a F protein on the cell surface. Thus, the F protein of GH-M74a showed a functional defect that is most likely caused by impaired trafficking leading to less efficient proteolytic activation and surface expression.

EP  - 86
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging paramyxovirus that can cause lethal respiratory illness in humans. No vaccine/therapeutic is currently licensed for humans. Human-to-human transmission was previously reported during outbreaks and NiV could be isolated from respiratory secretions, but the proportion of cases in Malaysia exhibiting respiratory symptoms was significantly lower than that in Bangladesh. Previously, we showed that primary human basal respiratory epithelial cells are susceptible to both NiV-Malaysia (M) and -Bangladesh (B) strains causing robust pro-inflammatory responses. However, the cells of the human respiratory epithelium that NiV targets are unknown and their role in NiV transmission and NiV-related lung pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Here, we characterized NiV infection of the human respiratory epithelium using a model of the human tracheal/bronchial (B-ALI) and small airway (S-ALI) epithelium cultured at an air-liquid interface. We show that NiV-M and NiV-B infect ciliated and secretory cells in B/S-ALI, and that infection of S-ALI, but not B-ALI, results in disruption of the epithelium integrity and host responses recruiting human immune cells. Interestingly, NiV-B replicated more efficiently in B-ALI than did NiV-M. These results suggest that the human tracheal/bronchial epithelium is favourable to NiV replication and shedding, while inducing a limited host response. Our data suggest that the small airways epithelium is prone to inflammation and lesions as well as constituting a point of virus entry into the pulmonary vasculature. The use of relevant models of the human respiratory tract, such as B/S-ALI, is critical for understanding NiV-related lung pathogenesis and identifying the underlying mechanisms allowing human-to-human transmission.

TI  - Characterization of the Interactions between the Nucleoprotein and the Phosphoprotein of Henipavirus*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 286
SP  - 13583
EP  - 13602
AB  - The Henipavirus genome is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N) within a helical nucleocapsid that recruits the polymerase complex via the phosphoprotein (P). In a previous study, we reported that in henipaviruses, the N-terminal domain of the phosphoprotein and the C-terminal domain of the nucleoprotein (NTAIL) are both intrinsically disordered. Here we show that Henipavirus NTAIL domains are also disordered in the context of full-length nucleoproteins. We also report the cloning, purification, and characterization of the C-terminal X domains (PXD) of Henipavirus phosphoproteins. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that NTAIL and PXD form a 1:1 stoichiometric complex that is stable under NaCl concentrations as high as 1 m and has a KD in the Œºm range. Using far-UV circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance, we show that PXD triggers an increase in the Œ±-helical content of NTAIL. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we show that PXD has no impact on the chemical environment of a Trp residue introduced at position 527 of the Henipavirus NTAIL domain, thus arguing for the lack of stable contacts between the C termini of NTAIL and PXD. Finally, we present a tentative structural model of the NTAIL-PXD interaction in which a short, order-prone region of NTAIL (Œ±-MoRE; amino acids 473‚Äì493) adopts an Œ±-helical conformation and is embedded between helices Œ±2 and Œ±3 of PXD, leading to a relatively small interface dominated by hydrophobic contacts. The present results provide the first detailed experimental characterization of the N-P interaction in henipaviruses and designate the NTAIL-PXD interaction as a valuable target for rational antiviral approaches.

VL  - 88 Pt 9
SP  - 2542
EP  - 51
AB  - Genome synthesis in paramyxoviruses, including Nipah virus (NiV), is controlled by sequence elements that reside in the non-coding nucleotides at the 5'-trailer (3'-antigenomic) end that make up the antigenomic promoter (AGP). Using a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase-based plasmid-driven minigenome system, the terminal 96 nt of NiV AGP were first mutagenized in blocks of three hexamers to enable broad mapping of the minigenome functional regions. This was followed by further dissection of these functional regions to define the cis-acting elements contained therein. Results based on RNA analysis and reporter gene activity identified a bipartite promoter structure similar to that seen in related viruses, but with some distinct differences: in NiV, each of the two discrete replication control elements was bimodal, characterized by a critical conserved region (nt 1-12 and 79-91) and a contiguous non-conserved region (nt 13-36 and 73-78), which appeared less important. The regulatory role of these less critical regions was underscored by the use of a two-step mutation strategy, which revealed the additive detrimental effect of substitutions in this part of the terminal element. The structure and sequence characteristics of the internal control element was also different: it involved four contiguous hexamers, and the region encompassing three of these (nt 79-96, corresponding to hexamers 14, 15 and 16), although analogous in position to the equivalent element in the Sendai virus AGP, was characterized by the distinct 5'-(GNNNUG)(14-15)(GNNNNN)(16) motif.

TI  - Co-assembly of Viral Envelope Glycoproteins Regulates Their Polarized Sorting in Neurons
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 10
AB  - Newly synthesized envelope glycoproteins of neuroinvasive viruses can be sorted in a polarized manner to the somatodendritic and/or axonal domains of neurons. Although critical for transneuronal spread of viruses, the molecular determinants and interregulation of this process are largely unknown. We studied the polarized sorting of the attachment (NiV-G) and fusion (NiV-F) glycoproteins of Nipah virus (NiV), a paramyxovirus that causes fatal human encephalitis, in rat hippocampal neurons. When expressed individually, NiV-G exhibited a non-polarized distribution, whereas NiV-F was specifically sorted to the somatodendritic domain. Polarized sorting of NiV-F was dependent on interaction of tyrosine-based signals in its cytosolic tail with the clathrin adaptor complex AP-1. Co-expression of NiV-G with NiV-F abolished somatodendritic sorting of NiV-F due to incorporation of NiV-G‚Ä¢NiV-F complexes into axonal transport carriers. We propose that faster biosynthetic transport of unassembled NiV-F allows for its proteolytic activation in the somatodendritic domain prior to association with NiV-G and axonal delivery of NiV-G‚Ä¢NiV-F complexes. Our study reveals how interactions of viral glycoproteins with the host's transport machinery and between themselves regulate their polarized sorting in neurons.

JF  - Molecular bioSystems
VL  - 8 1

EP  - 410
AB  - Henipaviruses are recently emerged severe human pathogens within the Paramyxoviridae family. Their genome is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N) within a helical nucleocapsid that recruits the polymerase complex via the phosphoprotein (P). We have previously shown that in Henipaviruses the N protein possesses an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain, N(TAIL), which undergoes Œ±-helical induced folding in the presence of the C-terminal domain (P(XD)) of the P protein. Using computational approaches, we previously identified within N(TAIL) four putative molecular recognition elements (MoREs) with different structural propensities, and proposed a structural model for the N(TAIL)-P(XD) complex where the MoRE encompassing residues 473-493 adopt an Œ±-helical conformation at the P(XD) surface. In this work, for each N(TAIL) protein, we designed four deletion constructs bearing different combinations of the predicted MoREs. Following purification of the N(TAIL) truncated proteins from the soluble fraction of E. coli, we characterized them in terms of their conformational, spectroscopic and binding properties. These studies provided direct experimental evidence for the structural state of the four predicted MoREs, and showed that two of them have clear Œ±-helical propensities, with the one spanning residues 473-493 being strictly required for binding to P(XD). We also showed that Henipavirus N(TAIL) and P(XD) form heterologous complexes, indicating that the P(XD) binding regions are functionally interchangeable between the two viruses. By combining spectroscopic and conformational analyses, we showed that the content in regular secondary structure is not a major determinant of protein compaction.

JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - The Nipah virus is responsible various outbreaks among countries of south east Asia, most recent is in Kerala, India. It is considered to be highly contagious and having a range of vectors for transmission. The condition worsens due to the lack of effective inhibitors. This study is first study, which focused to detect the differentially expressed genes among two different NiV studies from 2012 and 2017. The transcriptomic profiling data were retrieved from the sequence archives. The multivariate gene enrichment analyses were performed on the log transformed data from them using pathway, gene ontology, disease, reactome, etc. The comparison study suggests that the down regulated differentially expressed genes are common among them as compared to up regulated ones with statistical significance. However, among the diseased category the upregulated genes are mostly from metabolic pathways and diseased category like metabolic pathways, heart failure, cholesterol metabolism while the downregulated genes linked to various cancers, and viral diseases like hepatitis, dengue, influenza, etc. We found various small molecules mapped in the pathways which are differentially expressed among the studies, which could be targeted so as to control the Nipah infection. In order to design the inhibitors, our study would be useful to extract the effective and broad-spectrum drug targets.

TI  - Conserved Cysteine-Rich Domain of Paramyxovirus Simian Virus 5 V Protein Plays an Important Role in Blocking Apoptosis
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 5068
EP  - 5078
AB  - ABSTRACT The paramyxovirus family includes many well-known human and animal pathogens as well as emerging viruses such as Hendra virus and Nipah virus. The V protein of simian virus 5 (SV5), a prototype of the paramyxoviruses, contains a cysteine-rich C-terminal domain which is conserved among all paramyxovirus V proteins. The V protein can block both interferon (IFN) signaling by causing degradation of STAT1 and IFN production by blocking IRF-3 nuclear import. Previously, it was reported that recombinant SV5 lacking the C terminus of the V protein (rSV5VŒîC) induces a severe cytopathic effect (CPE) in tissue culture whereas wild-type (wt) SV5 infection does not induce CPE. In this study, the nature of the CPE and the mechanism of the induction of CPE were investigated. Through the use of DNA fragmentation, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling, and propidium iodide staining assays, it was shown that rSV5VŒîC induced apoptosis. Expression of wt V protein prevented apoptosis induced by rSV5VŒîC, suggesting that the V protein has an antiapoptotic function. Interestingly, rSV5VŒîC induced apoptosis in U3A cells (a STAT1-deficient cell line) and in the presence of neutralizing antibody against IFN, suggesting that the induction of apoptosis by rSV5VŒîC was independent of IFN and IFN-signaling pathways. Apoptosis induced by rSV5VŒîC was blocked by a general caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, but not by specific inhibitors against caspases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13, suggesting that rSV5VŒîC-induced apoptosis can occur in a caspase 12-dependent manner. Endoplasmic reticulum stress can lead to activation of caspase 12; compared to the results seen with mock and wt SV5 infection, rSV5VŒîC infection induced ER stress, as demonstrated by increased expression levels of known ER stress indicators GRP 78, GRP 94, and GADD153. These data suggest that rSV5VŒîC can trigger cell death by inducing ER stress.

JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 17
AB  - Nipah virus is a highly pathogenic zoonotic RNA virus, causing fatal encephalitis in humans. Like other negative-strand RNA viruses including Ebola and measles, its genome is wrapped by the nucleocapsid (N) protein forming a helical assembly. Here we report the CryoEM structure of the Nipah nucleocapsid protein-RNA assembly, at near atomic resolution. The N protein wraps the RNA genome with a periodicity of six nucleotides per protomer, around the outer edge of the helical assembly, in common with other paramyxoviruses. This structure uncovers details of the nucleocapsid assembly, demonstrating the role of the N-terminal arm of the N protein in the formation of the helical assembly and revealing details of the sequence-independent coordination of RNA binding in the ‚Äú3-bases-in, 3-bases-out‚Äù conformation. CryoEM analysis also reveals formation of clam-shaped assemblies of the N-protein, mediated by intersubunit interactions involving several N protein loop regions.

We present the crystal structure of the multimerization domain of Nipah virus P: a long, parallel, tetrameric, coiled coil with a small, Œ±-helical cap structure. Across the paramyxoviruses, these domains share little sequence identity yet are similar in length and structural organization, suggesting a common requirement for scaffolding or spatial organization of the functions of P in the virus life cycle.

TI  - Crystal Structure of the Pre-fusion Nipah Virus Fusion Glycoprotein Reveals a Novel Hexamer-of-Trimers Assembly
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is a paramyxovirus that infects host cells through the coordinated efforts of two envelope glycoproteins. The G glycoprotein attaches to cell receptors, triggering the fusion (F) glycoprotein to execute membrane fusion. Here we report the first crystal structure of the pre-fusion form of the NiV-F glycoprotein ectodomain. Interestingly this structure also revealed a hexamer-of-trimers encircling a central axis. Electron tomography of Nipah virus-like particles supported the hexameric pre-fusion model, and biochemical analyses supported the hexamer-of-trimers F assembly in solution. Importantly, structure-assisted site-directed mutagenesis of the interfaces between F trimers highlighted the functional relevance of the hexameric assembly. Shown here, in both cell-cell fusion and virus-cell fusion systems, our results suggested that this hexamer-of-trimers assembly was important during fusion pore formation. We propose that this assembly would stabilize the pre-fusion F conformation prior to cell attachment and facilitate the coordinated transition to a post-fusion conformation of all six F trimers upon triggering of a single trimer. Together, our data reveal a novel and functional pre-fusion architecture of a paramyxoviral fusion glycoprotein.

TI  - Crystal structures of Nipah and Hendra virus fusion core proteins
JF  - The Febs Journal
VL  - 273
SP  - 4538
EP  - 4547
AB  - The Nipah and Hendra viruses are highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses that recently emerged from flying foxes to cause serious disease outbreaks in humans and livestock in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and Bangladesh. Their unique genetic constitution, high virulence and wide host range set them apart from other paramyxoviruses. These characteristics have led to their classification into the new genus Henpavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae and to their designation as Biosafety Level 4 pathogens. The fusion protein, an enveloped glycoprotein essential for viral entry, belongs to the family of class I fusion proteins and is characterized by the presence of two heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR1 and HR2. These two regions associate to form a fusion‚Äêactive hairpin conformation that juxtaposes the viral and cellular membranes to facilitate membrane fusion and enable subsequent viral entry. The Hendra and Nipah virus fusion core proteins were crystallized and their structures determined to 2.2‚ÄÉ√Ö resolution. The Nipah and Hendra fusion core structures are six‚Äêhelix bundles with three HR2 helices packed against the hydrophobic grooves on the surface of a central coiled coil formed by three parallel HR1 helices in an oblique antiparallel manner. Because of the high level of conservation in core regions, it is proposed that the Nipah and Hendra virus fusion cores can provide a model for membrane fusion in all paramyxoviruses. The relatively deep grooves on the surface of the central coiled coil represent a good target site for drug discovery strategies aimed at inhibiting viral entry by blocking hairpin formation.

TI  - Cysteines in the Stalk of the Nipah Virus G Glycoprotein Are Located in a Distinct Subdomain Critical for Fusion Activation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 6632
EP  - 6642
AB  - ABSTRACT Paramyxoviruses initiate entry through the concerted action of the tetrameric attachment glycoprotein (HN, H, or G) and the trimeric fusion glycoprotein (F). The ectodomains of HN/H/G contain a stalk region important for oligomeric stability and for the F triggering resulting in membrane fusion. Paramyxovirus HN, H, and G form a dimer-of-dimers consisting of disulfide-linked dimers through their stalk domain cysteines. The G attachment protein stalk domain of the highly pathogenic Nipah virus (NiV) contains a distinct but uncharacterized cluster of three cysteine residues (C146, C158, C162). On the basis of a panoply of assays, we report that C158 and C162 of NiV-G likely mediate covalent subunit dimerization, while C146 mediates the stability of higher-order oligomers. For HN or H, mutation of stalk cysteines attenuates but does not abrogate the ability to trigger fusion. In contrast, the NiV-G stalk cysteine mutants were completely deficient in triggering fusion, even though they could still bind the ephrinB2 receptor and associate with F. Interestingly, all cysteine stalk mutants exhibited constitutive exposure of the Mab45 receptor binding-enhanced epitope, previously implicated in F triggering. The enhanced binding of Mab45 to the cysteine mutants relative to wild-type NiV-G, without the addition of the receptor, implicates the stalk cysteines in the stabilization of a pre-receptor-bound conformation and the regulation of F triggering. Sequence alignments revealed that the stalk cysteines were adjacent to a proline-rich microdomain unique to the Henipavirus genus. Our data propose that the cysteine cluster in the NiV-G stalk functions to maintain oligomeric stability but is more importantly involved in stabilizing a unique microdomain critical for triggering fusion.

TI  - Cytokine Induction in Nipah Virus-Infected Primary Human and Porcine Bronchial Epithelial Cells.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
AB  - During the Nipah virus (NiV) outbreak in Malaysia, pigs and humans were infected. While pigs generally developed severe respiratory disease due to an effective virus replication and associated inflammation processes in the porcine airways, respiratory symptoms in humans were rare and less severe. To elucidate the reasons for the species-specific differences in NiV airway infections, we compared the cytokine responses as a first reaction to NiV in primary porcine and human bronchial epithelial cells (PBEpC and HBEpC, respectively). In both cell types, NiV infections resulted in the expression of type III interferons (IFN-Œª). Upon infections with similar virus doses, the viral RNA load and IFN expression were substantially higher in HBEpC. Even if PBEpC expressed the same viral RNA amounts as NiV-infected HBEpC, the porcine cells showed a reduced IFN- and IFN-dependent antiviral gene expression. Despite this inherently limited IFN response, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8) in NiV-infected PBEpC was not decreased. The downregulation of the antiviral activity in the presence of a functional proinflammatory cytokine response might be one of the species-specific factors contributing to efficient virus replication and acute inflammation in the lungs of pigs infected with the Malaysian NiV strain.

TI  - Cytoplasmic Motifs in the Nipah Virus Fusion Protein Modulate Virus Particle Assembly and Egress
AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV), a paramyxovirus in the genus Henipavirus, has a mortality rate in humans of approximately 75%. While several studies have begun our understanding of NiV particle formation, the mechanism of this process remains to be fully elucidated. For many paramyxoviruses, M proteins drive viral assembly and egress; however, some paramyxoviral glycoproteins have been reported as important or essential in budding. For NiV the matrix protein (M), the fusion glycoprotein (F) and, to a much lesser extent, the attachment glycoprotein (G) autonomously induce the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs). However, functional interactions between these proteins during assembly and egress remain to be fully understood. Moreover, if the F-driven formation of VLPs occurs through interactions with host cell machinery, the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of F is a likely interactive domain. Therefore, we analyzed NiV F CT deletion and alanine mutants and report that several but not all regions of the F CT are necessary for efficient VLP formation. Two of these regions contain YXX√ò or dityrosine motifs previously shown to interact with cellular machinery involved in F endocytosis and transport. Importantly, our results showed that F-driven, M-driven, and M/F-driven viral particle formation enhanced the recruitment of G into VLPs. By identifying key motifs, specific residues, and functional viral protein interactions important for VLP formation, we improve our understanding of the viral assembly/egress process and point to potential interactions with host cell machinery. IMPORTANCE Henipaviruses can cause deadly infections of medical, veterinary, and agricultural importance. With recent discoveries of new henipa-like viruses, understanding the mechanisms by which these viruses reproduce is paramount. We have focused this study on identifying the functional interactions of three Nipah virus proteins during viral assembly and particularly on the role of one of these proteins, the fusion glycoprotein, in the incorporation of other viral proteins into viral particles. By identifying several regions in the fusion glycoprotein that drive viral assembly, we further our understanding of how these viruses assemble and egress from infected cells. The results presented will likely be useful toward designing treatments targeting this aspect of the viral life cycle and for the production of new viral particle-based vaccines.

TI  - Cytosolic Nipah Virus Inclusion Bodies Recruit Proteins Without Using Canonical Aggresome Pathways
VL  - 1
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is a BSL-4 classified zoonotic paramyxovirus that causes respiratory or encephalitic diseases. A hallmark of NiV infections, as with all cell infections caused by non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses, is the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs). We previously showed that cytosolic NiV IBs, which are formed in infected cells or in cells minimally expressing the NiV nucleocapsid proteins, are associated with the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) marker Œ≥-tubulin. They also recruit overexpressed cytosolic proteins that are not functionally required for viral replication in IBs and that otherwise might form toxic protein aggregates. Therefore, NiV IBs are thought to share some functional properties with cellular aggresomes. The fact that aggresomes were not found in NiV-infected cells supports the idea that NiV IBs are successfully reducing the proteotoxic stress in infected cells. Only if the proteasome-ubiquitin system is artificially blocked by inhibitors, cellular aggresomes are formed in addition to IBs, but without colocalizing. Although both structures were positive for the classical aggresome markers histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and Bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), they clearly differed in their cellular protein compositions and recruited overexpressed proteins to different extents. The further finding that inhibition of aggresome pathways by HDAC6 or microtubule (MT) inhibitors did neither interfere with IB formation nor with protein sequestration, strengthens the idea that cytosolic NiV IBs can assume some aggresome-like functions without involving active transport processes and canonical cellular aggresome pathways.

TI  - Detailed Molecular Biochemistry for Novel Therapeutic Design against Nipah and Hendra Virus: A Systematic Review.
JF  - Current molecular pharmacology
AB  - BACKGROUND
Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) of genus Henipavirus are the deadliest zoonotic virus, which cause severe respiratory ailment and fatal encephalitis in human and other susceptible animals. The fatality rate in these infections had been alarmingly high with no approved treatment available till date. Viral attachment and fusion with host cell membrane is essential for viral entry and is the most essential event of viral infection. Viral attachment is mediated by interaction of Henipavirus attachment glycoprotein (G) with host cell receptor: Ephrin B2/B3, while viral fusion and endocytosis is mediated by combined action of both viral glycoprotein (G) and fusion protein (F). Conclusion and Future Prospects: This review highlights the mechanism of viral attachment, fusion and also explained basic mechanism and pathobiology of infection in humans. The drugs and therapeutics used either experimentally or clinically against NiV and HeV infection are documented and classified in detail. Some amino acid residues essential for functionality of G and F proteins are also emphasized. Therapeutic designing to target and block these residues can serve as a promising approach in future drug development against NiV and HeV.

TI  - Detection of Receptor-Induced Glycoprotein Conformational Changes on Enveloped Virions by Using Confocal Micro-Raman Spectroscopy
AB  - ABSTRACT Conformational changes in the glycoproteins of enveloped viruses are critical for membrane fusion, which enables viral entry into cells and the pathological cell-cell fusion (syncytia) associated with some viral infections. However, technological capabilities for identifying viral glycoproteins and their conformational changes on actual enveloped virus surfaces are generally scarce, challenging, and time-consuming. Our model, Nipah virus (NiV), is a syncytium-forming biosafety level 4 pathogen with a high mortality rate (40 to 75%) in humans. Once the NiV attachment glycoprotein (G) (NiV-G) binds the cell receptor ephrinB2 or -B3, G triggers conformational changes in the fusion glycoprotein (F) that result in membrane fusion and viral entry. We demonstrate that confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy can, within minutes, simultaneously identify specific G and F glycoprotein signals and receptor-induced conformational changes in NiV-F on NiV virus-like particles (VLPs). First, we identified reproducible G- and F-specific Raman spectral features on NiV VLPs containing M (assembly matrix protein), G, and/or F or on NiV/vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped virions via second-derivative transformations and principal component analysis (PCA). Statistical analyses validated our PCA models. Dynamic temperature-induced conformational changes in F and G or receptor-induced target membrane-dependent conformational changes in F were monitored in NiV pseudovirions in situ in real time by confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy. Advantageously, Raman spectroscopy can identify specific protein signals in relatively impure samples. Thus, this proof-of-principle technological development has implications for the rapid identification and biostability characterization of viruses in medical, veterinary, and food samples and for the analysis of virion glycoprotein conformational changes in situ during viral entry.

TI  - Determination of a phosphorylation site in Nipah virus nucleoprotein and its involvement in virus transcription
JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 92

EP  - 2141
AB  - Many viruses use their host‚Äôs cellular machinery to regulate the functions of viral proteins. The phosphorylation of viral proteins is known to play a role in genome transcription and replication in paramyxoviruses. The paramyxovirus nucleoprotein (N), the most abundant protein in infected cells, is a component of the N‚ÄìRNA complex and supports the transcription and replication of virus mRNA and genomic RNA. Recently, we reported that the phosphorylation of measles virus N is involved in the regulation of viral RNA synthesis. In this study, we report a rapid turnover of phosphorylation in the Nipah virus N (NiV-N). The phosphorylated NiV-N was hardly detectable in steady-state cells, but was detected after inhibition of cellular protein phosphatases. We identified a phosphorylated serine residue at Ser451 of NiV-N by peptide mass fingerprinting by electrospray ionization‚Äìquadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In the NiV minigenome assay, using luciferase as a reporter gene, the substitution of Ser451 for alanine in NiV-N resulted in a reduction in luciferase activity of approximately 45‚Ää% compared with the wild-type protein. Furthermore, the substitution of Ser451 for glutamic acid, which mimics a phosphoserine, led to a more significant decrease in luciferase activity ‚Äì approximately 81‚Ää%. Northern blot analysis showed that both virus transcription and replication were reduced by these mutations. These results suggest that a rapid turnover of the phosphorylation of NiV-N plays an important role in virus transcription and replication.

EP  - 404
AB  - The henipaviruses, Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV), are highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxoviruses. Like many other paramyxoviruses, henipaviruses employ a process of co-transcriptional mRNA editing during transcription of the phosphoprotein (P) gene to generate additional mRNAs encoding the V and W proteins. The C protein is translated from the P mRNA, but in an alternate reading frame. Sequence analysis of multiple, cloned mRNAs showed that the mRNA editing frequencies of the P genes of the henipaviruses are higher than those reported for other paramyxoviruses. Antisera to synthetic peptides from the P, V, W and C proteins of NiV were generated to study their expression in infected cells. All proteins were detected in both infected cells and purified virions. In infected cells, the W protein was detected in the nucleus while P, V and C were found in the cytoplasm.

TI  - Differential Innate Immune Responses Elicited by Nipah Virus and Cedar Virus Correlate with Disparate In Vivo Pathogenesis in Hamsters
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) are a pathogenesis model for the Nipah virus (NiV), and we sought to determine if they are also susceptible to the Cedar virus (CedPV). Following intranasal inoculation with CedPV, virus replication occurred in the lungs and spleens of infected hamsters, a neutralizing antibody was produced in some hamsters within 8 days post-challenge, and no conspicuous signs of disease occurred. CedPV replicated to a similar magnitude as NiV-Bangladesh in type I IFN-deficient BHK-21 Syrian hamster fibroblasts but replicated 4 logs lower in type I IFN-competent primary Syrian hamster and human pulmonary endothelial cells, a principal target of henipaviruses. The coinfection of these cells with CedPV and NiV failed to rescue CedPV titers and did not diminish NiV titers, suggesting the replication machinery is virus-specific. Type I IFN response transcripts Ifna7, Ddx58, Stat1, Stat2, Ccl5, Cxcl10, Isg20, Irf7, and Iigp1 were all significantly elevated in CedPV-infected hamster endothelial cells, whereas Ifna7 and Iigp1 expression were significantly repressed during NiV infection. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CedPV‚Äôs inability to counter the host type I IFN response may, in part, contribute to its lack of pathogenicity. Because NiV causes a fatal disease in Syrian hamsters with similarities to human disease, this model will provide valuable information about the pathogenic mechanisms of henipaviruses.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83
SP  - 8998
EP  - 9001
AB  - ABSTRACT Hendra virus F protein-promoted membrane fusion requires the presence of the viral attachment protein, G. However, events leading to the association of these glycoproteins remain unclear. Results presented here demonstrate that Hendra virus G undergoes slower secretory pathway trafficking than is observed for Hendra virus F. This slowed trafficking is not dependent on the G protein cytoplasmic tail, the presence of the G receptor ephrin B2, or interaction with other viral proteins. Instead, Hendra virus G was found to undergo intrinsically slow oligomerization within the endoplasmic reticulum. These results suggest that the critical F-G interactions occur only after the initial steps of synthesis and cellular transport.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 6208
EP  - 6217
AB  - ABSTRACT Hendra virus is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus within the Paramyxoviridae family which, together with Nipah virus, forms the Henipavirus genus. Infection with bat-borne Hendra virus leads to a disease with high mortality rates in humans. We determined the crystal structure of the unliganded six-bladed Œ≤-propeller domain and compared it to the previously reported structure of Hendra virus attachment glycoprotein (HeV-G) in complex with its cellular receptor, ephrin-B2. As observed for the related unliganded Nipah virus structure, there is plasticity in the Glu579-Pro590 and Lys236-Ala245 ephrin-binding loops prior to receptor engagement. These data reveal that henipaviral attachment glycoproteins undergo common structural transitions upon receptor binding and further define the structural template for antihenipaviral drug design. Our analysis also provides experimental evidence for a dimeric arrangement of HeV-G that exhibits striking similarity to those observed in crystal structures of related paramyxovirus receptor-binding glycoproteins. The biological relevance of this dimer is further supported by the positional analysis of glycosylation sites from across the paramyxoviruses. In HeV-G, the sites lie away from the putative dimer interface and remain accessible to Œ±-mannosidase processing on oligomerization. We therefore propose that the overall mode of dimer assembly is conserved for all paramyxoviruses; however, while the geometry of dimerization is rather closely similar for those viruses that bind flexible glycan receptors, significant (up to 60¬∞) and different reconfigurations of the subunit packing (associated with a significant decrease in the size of the dimer interface) have accompanied the independent switching to high-affinity protein receptor binding in Hendra and measles viruses.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 11152
EP  - 11163
AB  - ABSTRACT The V protein of the paramyxovirus subfamily Paramyxovirinae is an important virulence factor that can interfere with host innate immunity by inactivating the cytosolic pathogen recognition receptor MDA5. This interference is a result of a protein-protein interaction between the highly conserved carboxyl-terminal domain of the V protein and the helicase domain of MDA5. The V protein C-terminal domain (CTD) is an evolutionarily conserved 49- to 68-amino-acid region that coordinates two zinc atoms per protein chain. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues in the V protein CTD has revealed both universal and virus-specific requirements for zinc coordination in MDA5 engagement and has also identified other conserved residues as critical for MDA5 interaction and interference. Mutation of these residues produces V proteins that are specifically defective for MDA5 interference and not impaired in targeting STAT1 for proteasomal degradation via the VDC ubiquitin ligase complex. Results demonstrate that mutation of conserved charged residues in the V proteins of Nipah virus, measles virus, and mumps virus also abolishes MDA5 interaction. These findings clearly define molecular determinants for MDA5 inhibition by the paramyxovirus V proteins.

TI  - Distinct Cell Transcriptomic Landscapes Upon Henipavirus Infections
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 11
AB  - Hendra virus (HeV) and Cedar virus (CedV) are henipaviruses, which fall into the Paramyxoviridae family of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses. HeV is classified as a Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) agent, as it is highly pathogenic and is often fatal to humans. To date, no HeV prevention or treatment methods for human are available. In contrast, previous experimental infection studies have suggested that CedV is non-pathogenic. Flying foxes (pteropid bats) in Australia are the natural reservoirs of both viruses, but the cellular responses of bats to these viral infections remain unclear. Here, we infected bat and human cells with these viruses. We then examined the total transcriptomic landscapes of the cells at 6 or 24 h post infection. Unexpectedly, despite the close phylogenetic relationship between HeV and CedV, there was a dramatic difference in cellular gene expression patterns in response to the two different infections. It is likely that minor differences in the phosphoprotein (P) gene coding strategy between the two viruses cause the observed incongruence in host transcriptomic divergence and viral lethality. This study greatly expands our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of henipaviruses.

TI  - Downregulation of Nipah Virus N mRNA Occurs through Interaction between Its 3‚Ä≤ Untranslated Region and hnRNP D
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 6582
EP  - 6588
AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV) is a nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Henipavirus, family Paramyxoviridae. NiV causes acute encephalitis and respiratory disease in humans, is associated with high mortality, and poses a threat in southern Asia. The genomes of henipaviruses are about 18,246 nucleotides (nt) long, which is longer than those of other paramyxoviruses (around 15,384 nt). This difference is caused by the noncoding RNA region, particularly the 3‚Ä≤ untranslated region (UTR), which occupies more than half of the noncoding RNA region. To determine the function(s) of the NiV noncoding RNA region, we investigated the effects of NiV 3‚Ä≤ UTRs on reporter gene expression. The NiV N 3‚Ä≤ UTR (nt 1 to 100) demonstrated strong repressor activity associated with hnRNP D protein binding to that region. Mutation of the hnRNP D binding site or knockdown of hnRNP D resulted in increased expression of the NiV N 3‚Ä≤ UTR reporter. Our findings suggest that NiV N expression is repressed by hnRNP D through the NiV N 3‚Ä≤ UTR and demonstrate the involvement of posttranscriptional regulation in the NiV life cycle. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first report of the functions of the NiV noncoding RNA region.

TI  - Drivers and Distribution of Henipavirus-Induced Syncytia: What Do We Know?
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Syncytium formation, i.e., cell‚Äìcell fusion resulting in the formation of multinucleated cells, is a hallmark of infection by paramyxoviruses and other pathogenic viruses. This natural mechanism has historically been a diagnostic marker for paramyxovirus infection in vivo and is now widely used for the study of virus-induced membrane fusion in vitro. However, the role of syncytium formation in within-host dissemination and pathogenicity of viruses remains poorly understood. The diversity of henipaviruses and their wide host range and tissue tropism make them particularly appropriate models with which to characterize the drivers of syncytium formation and the implications for virus fitness and pathogenicity. Based on the henipavirus literature, we summarized current knowledge on the mechanisms driving syncytium formation, mostly acquired from in vitro studies, and on the in vivo distribution of syncytia. While these data suggest that syncytium formation widely occurs across henipaviruses, hosts, and tissues, we identified important data gaps that undermined our understanding of the role of syncytium formation in virus pathogenesis. Based on these observations, we propose solutions of varying complexity to fill these data gaps, from better practices in data archiving and publication for in vivo studies, to experimental approaches in vitro.

TI  - Dual microRNA Screens Reveal That the Immune-Responsive miR-181 Promotes Henipavirus Entry and Cell-Cell Fusion
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - Hendra and Nipah viruses (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus) are bat-borne viruses that cause fatal disease in humans and a range of other mammalian species. Gaining a deeper understanding of host pathways exploited by henipaviruses for infection may identify targets for new anti-viral therapies. Here we have performed genome-wide high-throughput agonist and antagonist screens at biosafety level 4 to identify host-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) impacting henipavirus infection in human cells. Members of the miR-181 and miR-17~93 families strongly promoted Hendra virus infection. miR-181 also promoted Nipah virus infection, but did not affect infection by paramyxoviruses from other genera, indicating specificity in the virus-host interaction. Infection promotion was primarily mediated via the ability of miR-181 to significantly enhance henipavirus-induced membrane fusion. Cell signalling receptors of ephrins, namely EphA5 and EphA7, were identified as novel negative regulators of henipavirus fusion. The expression of these receptors, as well as EphB4, were suppressed by miR-181 overexpression, suggesting that simultaneous inhibition of several Ephs by the miRNA contributes to enhanced infection and fusion. Immune-responsive miR-181 levels was also up-regulated in the biofluids of ferrets and horses infected with Hendra virus, suggesting that the host innate immune response may promote henipavirus spread and exacerbate disease severity. This study is the first genome-wide screen of miRNAs influencing infection by a clinically significant mononegavirus and nominates select miRNAs as targets for future anti-viral therapy development.

TI  - Dynamics of the Intrinsically Disordered C‚ÄêTerminal Domain of the Nipah Virus Nucleoprotein and Interaction with the X Domain of the Phosphoprotein as Unveiled by NMR Spectroscopy
JF  - ChemBioChem
VL  - 16
AB  - We provide an atomic‚Äêresolution description based on NMR spectroscopy, of the intrinsically disordered C‚Äêterminal domain of the Nipah virus nucleoprotein (NTAIL), both in its isolated state and within the nucleocapsid (NC). Within the NC the second half of NTAIL retains conformational behavior similar to that of isolated NTAIL, whereas the first half of NTAIL becomes much more rigid. In spite of the mostly disordered nature of NTAIL, chemical shifts and relaxation measurements show a significant degree of Œ±‚Äêhelical sampling in the molecular recognition element (MoRE) involved in binding to the X domain (XD) of the phosphoprotein, with this preconfiguration being more pronounced than in the NTAIL domain from the cognate Hendra virus. Outside the MoRE, an additional region exhibiting reduced flexibility was identified within NTAIL and found to be involved in binding to the XD. 1H‚Äê and 13C‚Äêdetected titration NMR experiments support a highly dynamic binding of NTAIL at the surface of the XD.

AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus that causes pronounced infection of brain endothelia and central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Using primary porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells, we showed that upregulation of E-selectin precedes cytokine induction and is induced not only by infectious NiV but also by NiV-glycoprotein-containing virus-like particles. This demonstrates that very early events in NiV brain endothelial infection do not depend on NiV replication but can be triggered by the NiV glycoproteins alone.

TI  - Electrostatic Interactions between Hendra Virus Matrix Proteins Are Required for Efficient Virus-Like-Particle Assembly
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 92
AB  - ABSTRACT Hendra virus (HeV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus belonging to the genus Henipavirus. HeV is highly pathogenic, and it can cause severe neurological and respiratory illnesses in both humans and animals, with an extremely high mortality rate of up to 70%. Among the genes that HeV encodes, the matrix (M) protein forms an integral part of the virion structure and plays critical roles in coordinating viral assembly and budding. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of this process is not fully elucidated. Here, we determined the crystal structure of HeV M to 2.5-‚Ñ´ resolution. The dimeric structural configuration of HeV M is similar to that of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) M and is fundamental to protein stability and effective virus-like-particle (VLP) formation. Analysis of the crystal packing revealed a notable interface between the Œ±1 and Œ±2 helices of neighboring HeV M dimers, with key residues sharing degrees of sequence conservation among henipavirus M proteins. Structurally, a network of electrostatic interactions dominates the Œ±1-Œ±2 interactions, involving residues Arg57 from the Œ±1 helix and Asp105 and Glu108 from the Œ±2 helix. The disruption of the Œ±1-Œ±2 interactions using engineered charge reversal substitutions (R57E, R57D, and E108R) resulted in significant reduction or abrogation of VLP production. This phenotype was reversible with an R57E E108R mutant that was designed to partly restore salt bridge contacts. Collectively, our results define and validate previously underappreciated regions of henipavirus M proteins that are crucial for productive VLP assembly. IMPORTANCE Hendra virus is a henipavirus associated with lethal infections in humans. It is classified as a biosafety level 4 (BSL4) agent, and there are currently no preventive or therapeutic treatments available against HeV. Vital to henipavirus pathogenesis, the structural protein M has been implicated in viral assembly and budding, as well as host-virus interactions. However, there is no structural information available for henipavirus M, and the basis of M-driven viral assembly is not fully elucidated. We demonstrate the first three-dimensional structure of a henipavirus M protein. We show the dimeric organization of HeV M as a basic unit for higher-order oligomerization. Additionally, we define key regions/residues of HeV M that are required for productive virus-like-particle formation. These findings provide the first insight into the mechanism of M-driven assembly in henipavirus.

TI  - Endocytosis Plays a Critical Role in Proteolytic Processing of the Hendra Virus Fusion Protein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 12643
EP  - 12649
AB  - ABSTRACT The Hendra virus fusion (F) protein is synthesized as a precursor protein, F0, which is proteolytically processed to the mature form, F1+F2. Unlike the case for the majority of paramyxovirus F proteins, the processing event is furin independent, does not require the addition of exogenous proteases, is not affected by reductions in intracellular Ca2+, and is strongly affected by conditions that raise the intracellular pH (C. T. Pager, M. A. Wurth, and R. E. Dutch, J. Virol. 78:9154-9163, 2004). The Hendra virus F protein cytoplasmic tail contains a consensus motif for endocytosis, YXXŒ¶. To analyze the potential role of endocytosis in the processing and membrane fusion promotion of the Hendra virus F protein, mutation of tyrosine 525 to alanine (Hendra virus F Y525A) or phenylalanine (Hendra virus F Y525F) was performed. The rate of endocytosis of Hendra virus F Y525A was significantly reduced compared to that of the wild-type (wt) F protein, confirming the functional importance of the endocytosis motif. An intermediate level of endocytosis was observed for Hendra virus F Y525F. Surprisingly, dramatic reductions in the rate of proteolytic processing were observed for Hendra virus F Y525A, although initial transport to the cell surface was not affected. The levels of surface expression for both Hendra virus F Y525A and Hendra virus F Y525F were higher than that of the wt protein, and these mutants displayed enhanced syncytium formation. These results suggest that endocytosis is critically important for Hendra virus F protein cleavage, representing a new paradigm for proteolytic processing of paramyxovirus F proteins.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 3865
EP  - 3872
AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV), a highly pathogenic member of the family Paramyxoviridae, encodes the surface glycoproteins F and G. Since internalization of the NiV envelope proteins from the cell surface might be of functional importance for viral pathogenesis either by regulating cytopathogenicity or by modulating recognition of infected cells by the immune system, we analyzed the endocytosis of the NiV F and G proteins. Interestingly, we found both glycoproteins to be internalized in infected and transfected cells. As endocytosis is normally mediated by tyrosine- or dileucine-dependent signals in the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane proteins, all potential internalization signals in the NiV glycoproteins were mutated. Whereas the G protein appeared to be constitutively internalized with the bulk flow during membrane turnover, uptake of the F protein was found to be signal mediated. F endocytosis clearly depended on a membrane-proximal YXXŒ¶ motif and was found to be of functional importance for the biological activity of the protein.

TI  - Endothelial Galectin-1 Binds to Specific Glycans on Nipah Virus Fusion Protein and Inhibits Maturation, Mobility, and Function to Block Syncytia Formation
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 6
AB  - Nipah virus targets human endothelial cells via NiV-F and NiV-G envelope glycoproteins, resulting in endothelial syncytia formation and vascular compromise. Endothelial cells respond to viral infection by releasing innate immune effectors, including galectins, which are secreted proteins that bind to specific glycan ligands on cell surface glycoproteins. We demonstrate that galectin-1 reduces NiV-F mediated fusion of endothelial cells, and that endogenous galectin-1 in endothelial cells is sufficient to inhibit syncytia formation. Galectin-1 regulates NiV-F mediated cell fusion at three distinct points, including retarding maturation of nascent NiV-F, reducing NiV-F lateral mobility on the plasma membrane, and directly inhibiting the conformational change in NiV-F required for triggering fusion. Characterization of the NiV-F N-glycome showed that the critical site for galectin-1 inhibition is rich in glycan structures known to bind galectin-1. These studies identify a unique set of mechanisms for regulating pathophysiology of NiV infection at the level of the target cell.

AB  - Abstract:‚ÄÇ Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses are members of the newly defined Henipavirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae. Nipah virus (NiV) is an emergent paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in up to 70% of infected patients, and there is increasing evidence of human‚Äêto‚Äêhuman transmission. NiV is designated a priority pathogen in the NIAID Biodefense Research Agenda, and could be a devastating agent of agrobioterrorism if used against the pig farming industry. Endothelial syncytium is a pathognomonic feature of NiV infections, and is mediated by the fusion (F) and attachment (G) envelope glycoproteins. This review summarizes what is known about the pathophysiology of NiV infections, and documents the identification of the NiV receptor. EphrinB2, the NiV and HeV receptor, is expressed on endothelial cells and neurons, consistent with the known cellular tropism for NiV. We discuss how the identification of the henipahvirus receptor sheds light on the pathobiology of NiV infection, and how it will spur the rational development of effective therapeutics. In addition, ephrinB3, a related protein, can serve as an alternative receptor, and we suggest that differential usage of ephrinB2 versus B3 may explain the variant pathogenic profiles observed between NiV and HeV. Thus, identifying the NiV receptors opens the door for a more comprehensive analysis of the envelope‚Äìreceptor interactions in NiV pathobiology. Finally, we also describe how galectin‚Äê1 (an innate immune defense lectin) can interact with specific N‚Äêglycans on the Nipah envelope fusion protein, underscoring the potential role that innate immune defense mechanisms may play against emerging pathogens.

EP  - 7
AB  - Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) belong to the genus Henipavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae and are unique in that they exhibit a broad species tropism and cause fatal disease in both animals and humans. They infect cells through a pH-independent membrane fusion process mediated by their fusion and attachment glycoproteins. Previously, we demonstrated identical cell fusion tropisms for HeV and NiV and the protease-sensitive nature of their unknown cell receptor and identified a human cell line (HeLa-USU) that was nonpermissive for fusion and virus infection. Here, a microarray analysis was performed on the HeLa-USU cells, permissive HeLa-CCL2 cells, and two other permissive human cell lines. From this analysis, we identified a list of genes encoding known and predicted plasma membrane surface-expressed proteins that were highly expressed in all permissive cells and absent from the HeLa-USU cells and rank-ordered them based on their relative levels. Available expression vectors containing the first 10 genes were obtained and individually transfected into HeLa-USU cells. One clone, encoding human ephrin-B2 (EFNB2), was found capable of rendering HeLa-USU cells permissive for HeV- and NiV-mediated cell fusion as well as infection by live virus. A soluble recombinant EFNB2 could potently block fusion and infection and bind soluble recombinant HeV and NiV attachment glycoproteins with high affinity. Together, these data indicate that EFNB2 serves as a functional receptor for both HeV and NiV. The highly conserved nature of EFNB2 in humans and animals is consistent with the broad tropism exhibited by these emerging zoonotic viruses.

TI  - EphrinB2 clustering by Nipah virus G is required to activate and trap F intermediates at supported lipid bilayer‚Äìcell interfaces
JF  - Science Advances
VL  - 7
AB  - The reconstitution of Nipah virus fusion activation provides new insights into the dynamics of the viral entry glycoproteins. Paramyxovirus membrane fusion requires an attachment protein that binds to a host cell receptor and a fusion protein that merges the viral and host membranes. For Nipah virus (NiV), the G attachment protein binds ephrinB2/B3 receptors and activates F-mediated fusion. To visualize dynamic events of these proteins at the membrane interface, we reconstituted NiV fusion activation by overlaying F- and G-expressing cells onto ephrinB2-functionalized supported lipid bilayers and used TIRF microscopy to follow F, G, and ephrinB2. We found that G and ephrinB2 form clusters and that oligomerization of ephrinB2 is necessary for F activation. Single-molecule tracking of F particles revealed accumulation of an immobilized intermediate upon activation. We found no evidence for stable F-G protein complexes before or after activation. These observations lead to a revised model for NiV fusion activation and provide a foundation for investigating other multicomponent viral fusion systems.

TI  - Evidence for Ubiquitin-Regulated Nuclear and Subnuclear Trafficking among Paramyxovirinae Matrix Proteins
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 11
AB  - The paramyxovirus matrix (M) protein is a molecular scaffold required for viral morphogenesis and budding at the plasma membrane. Transient nuclear residence of some M proteins hints at non-structural roles. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms that regulate the nuclear sojourn. Previously, we found that the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of Nipah virus M (NiV-M) is a prerequisite for budding, and is regulated by a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLSbp), a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES), and monoubiquitination of the K258 residue within the NLSbp itself (NLSbp-lysine). To define whether the sequence determinants of nuclear trafficking identified in NiV-M are common among other Paramyxovirinae M proteins, we generated the homologous NES and NLSbp-lysine mutations in M proteins from the five major Paramyxovirinae genera. Using quantitative 3D confocal microscopy, we determined that the NES and NLSbp-lysine are required for the efficient nuclear export of the M proteins of Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Sendai virus, and Mumps virus. Pharmacological depletion of free ubiquitin or mutation of the conserved NLSbp-lysine to an arginine, which inhibits M ubiquitination, also results in nuclear and nucleolar retention of these M proteins. Recombinant Sendai virus (rSeV-eGFP) bearing the NES or NLSbp-lysine M mutants rescued at similar efficiencies to wild type. However, foci of cells expressing the M mutants displayed marked fusogenicity in contrast to wild type, and infection did not spread. Recombinant Mumps virus (rMuV-eGFP) bearing the homologous mutations showed similar defects in viral morphogenesis. Finally, shotgun proteomics experiments indicated that the interactomes of Paramyxovirinae M proteins are significantly enriched for components of the nuclear pore complex, nuclear transport receptors, and nucleolar proteins. We then synthesize our functional and proteomics data to propose a working model for the ubiquitin-regulated nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of cognate paramyxovirus M proteins that show a consistent nuclear trafficking phenotype.

TI  - Evidence of a Potential Receptor-Binding Site on the Nipah Virus G Protein (NiV-G): Identification of Globular Head Residues with a Role in Fusion Promotion and Their Localization on an NiV-G Structural Model
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 7546
EP  - 7554
AB  - ABSTRACT As a preliminary to the localization of the receptor-binding site(s) on the Nipah virus (NiV) glycoprotein (NiV-G), we have undertaken the identification of NiV-G residues that play a role in fusion promotion. To achieve this, we have used two strategies. First, as NiV and Hendra virus (HeV) share a common receptor and their cellular tropism is similar, we hypothesized that residues functioning in receptor attachment could be conserved between their respective G proteins. Our initial strategy was to target charged residues (which can be expected to be at the surface of the protein) conserved between the NiV-G and HeV-G globular heads. Second, we generated NiV variants that escaped neutralization by anti-NiV-G monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that neutralize NiV both in vitro and in vivo, likely by blocking receptor attachment. The sequencing of such ‚Äúescape mutants‚Äù identified NiV-G residues present in the epitopes to which the neutralizing MAbs are directed. Residues identified via these two strategies whose mutation had an effect on fusion promotion were localized on a new structural model for the NiV-G protein. Our results suggest that seven NiV-G residues, including one (E533) that was identified using both strategies, form a contiguous site on the top of the globular head that is implicated in ephrinB2 binding. This site commences near the shallow depression in the center of the top surface of the globular head and extends to the rim of the barrel-like structure on the top loops of Œ≤-sheet 5. The topology of this site is strikingly similar to that proposed to form the SLAM receptor site on another paramyxovirus attachment protein, that of the measles virus hemagglutinin.

TI  - Evolution and Structural Organization of the C Proteins of Paramyxovirinae
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 9
AB  - The phosphoprotein (P) gene of most Paramyxovirinae encodes several proteins in overlapping frames: P and V, which share a common N-terminus (PNT), and C, which overlaps PNT. Overlapping genes are of particular interest because they encode proteins originated de novo, some of which have unknown structural folds, challenging the notion that nature utilizes only a limited, well-mapped area of fold space. The C proteins cluster in three groups, comprising measles, Nipah, and Sendai virus. We predicted that all C proteins have a similar organization: a variable, disordered N-terminus and a conserved, Œ±-helical C-terminus. We confirmed this predicted organization by biophysically characterizing recombinant C proteins from Tupaia paramyxovirus (measles group) and human parainfluenza virus 1 (Sendai group). We also found that the C of the measles and Nipah groups have statistically significant sequence similarity, indicating a common origin. Although the C of the Sendai group lack sequence similarity with them, we speculate that they also have a common origin, given their similar genomic location and structural organization. Since C is dispensable for viral replication, unlike PNT, we hypothesize that C may have originated de novo by overprinting PNT in the ancestor of Paramyxovirinae. Intriguingly, in measles virus and Nipah virus, PNT encodes STAT1-binding sites that overlap different regions of the C-terminus of C, indicating they have probably originated independently. This arrangement, in which the same genetic region encodes simultaneously a crucial functional motif (a STAT1-binding site) and a highly constrained region (the C-terminus of C), seems paradoxical, since it should severely reduce the ability of the virus to adapt. The fact that it originated twice suggests that it must be balanced by an evolutionary advantage, perhaps from reducing the size of the genetic region vulnerable to mutations.

TI  - Experimental Evidence of Intrinsic Disorder and Amyloid Formation by the Henipavirus W Proteins
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 23
AB  - Henipaviruses are severe human pathogens within the Paramyxoviridae family. Beyond the P protein, the Henipavirus P gene also encodes the V and W proteins which share with P their N-terminal, intrinsically disordered domain (NTD) and possess a unique C-terminal domain. Henipavirus W proteins antagonize interferon (IFN) signaling through NTD-mediated binding to STAT1 and STAT4, and prevent type I IFN expression and production of chemokines. Structural and molecular information on Henipavirus W proteins is lacking. By combining various bioinformatic approaches, we herein show that the Henipaviruses W proteins are predicted to be prevalently disordered and yet to contain short order-prone segments. Using limited proteolysis, differential scanning fluorimetry, analytical size exclusion chromatography, far-UV circular dichroism and small-angle X-ray scattering, we experimentally confirmed their overall disordered nature. In addition, using Congo red and Thioflavin T binding assays and negative-staining transmission electron microscopy, we show that the W proteins phase separate to form amyloid-like fibrils. The present study provides an additional example, among the few reported so far, of a viral protein forming amyloid-like fibrils, therefore significantly contributing to enlarge our currently limited knowledge of viral amyloids. In light of the critical role of the Henipavirus W proteins in evading the host innate immune response and of the functional role of phase separation in biology, these studies provide a conceptual asset to further investigate the functional impact of the phase separation abilities of the W proteins.

TI  - Exploring the Human-Nipah Virus Protein-Protein Interactome
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 91
AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus is an emerging, highly pathogenic, zoonotic virus of the Paramyxoviridae family. Human transmission occurs by close contact with infected animals, the consumption of contaminated food, or, occasionally, via other infected individuals. Currently, we lack therapeutic or prophylactic treatments for Nipah virus. To develop these agents we must now improve our understanding of the host-virus interactions that underpin a productive infection. This aim led us to perform the present work, in which we identified 101 human-Nipah virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs), most of which (88) are novel. This data set provides a comprehensive view of the host complexes that are manipulated by viral proteins. Host targets include the PRP19 complex and the microRNA (miRNA) processing machinery. Furthermore, we explored the biologic consequences of the interaction with the PRP19 complex and found that the Nipah virus W protein is capable of altering p53 control and gene expression. We anticipate that these data will help in guiding the development of novel interventional strategies to counter this emerging viral threat. IMPORTANCE Nipah virus is a recently discovered virus that infects a wide range of mammals, including humans. Since its discovery there have been yearly outbreaks, and in some of them the mortality rate has reached 100% of the confirmed cases. However, the study of Nipah virus has been largely neglected, and currently we lack treatments for this infection. To develop these agents we must now improve our understanding of the host-virus interactions that underpin a productive infection. In the present work, we identified 101 human-Nipah virus protein-protein interactions using an affinity purification approach coupled with mass spectrometry. Additionally, we explored the cellular consequences of some of these interactions. Globally, this data set offers a comprehensive and detailed view of the host machinery's contribution to the Nipah virus's life cycle. Furthermore, our data present a large number of putative drug targets that could be exploited for the treatment of this infection.

TI  - Expression and purification of the matrix protein of Nipah virus in baculovirus insect cell system
JF  - Biotechnology Progress
VL  - 32
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) causes fatal respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans and animals. The matrix (M) protein of NiV plays an important role in the viral assembly and budding process. Thus, an access to the NiV M protein is vital to the design of viral antigens as diagnostic reagents. In this study, recombinant DNA technology was successfully adopted in the cloning and expression of NiV M protein. A recombinant expression cassette (baculovirus expression vector) was used to encode an N‚Äêterminally His‚Äêtagged NiV M protein in insect cells. A time‚Äêcourse study demonstrated that the highest yield of recombinant M protein (400‚Äì500 Œºg) was expressed from 107 infected cells 3 days after infection. A single‚Äêstep purification method based on metal ion affinity chromatography was established to purify the NiV M protein, which successfully yielded a purity level of 95.67% and a purification factor of 3.39. The Western blotting and enzyme‚Äêlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the purified recombinant M protein (48 kDa) was antigenic and reacted strongly with the serum of a NiV infected pig. ¬© 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

TI  - Functional Analysis of the Fusion and Attachment Glycoproteins of Mojiang Henipavirus
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Mojiang virus (MojV) is the first henipavirus identified in a rodent and known only by sequence data, whereas all other henipaviruses have been isolated from bats (Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Cedar virus) or discovered by sequence data from material of bat origin (Ghana virus). Ephrin-B2 and -B3 are entry receptors for Hendra and Nipah viruses, but Cedar virus can utilize human ephrin-B1, -B2, -A2 and -A5 and mouse ephrin-A1. However, the entry receptor for MojV remains unknown, and its species tropism is not well characterized. Here, we utilized recombinant full-length and soluble forms of the MojV fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins in membrane fusion and receptor tropism studies. MojV F and G were functionally competent and mediated cell‚Äìcell fusion in primate and rattine cells, albeit with low levels and slow fusion kinetics. Although a relative instability of the pre-fusion conformation of a soluble form of MojV F was observed, MojV F displayed significantly greater fusion activity when heterotypically paired with Ghana virus G. An exhaustive investigation of A- and B-class ephrins indicated that none serve as a primary receptor for MojV. The MojV cell fusion phenotype is therefore likely the result of receptor restriction rather than functional defects in recombinant MojV F and G glycoproteins.

AB  - ABSTRACT Recent evidence identified multiple Henipavirus species in Africa distinct from those in Southeast Asia and Australia. The reported fusion glycoprotein (F) sequence of the African Gh-M74a strain (GhV-F) is likely incorrect: a single base pair deletion near the N terminus results in multiple aberrancies. Rectifying this by adding single nucleotide insertions results in a GhV-F that now possesses a signal peptide, is efficiently cell surface expressed, exhibits syncytium formation when coexpressed with GhV-G protein, and mediates pseudotyped viral particle entry.

TI  - Functional analysis of the L Protein of Nipah Virus Using Minigenome System
JF  - 
VL  - 3
SP  - 36
EP  - 42
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) was identified in Malaysia in late September 1998 as the etiological agent of an outbreak of acute encephalitis with the high mortality rate in human. NiV polymerase gene (L) encodes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which is an enzyme required for viral replication. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the N terminal of polymerase protein in replication of NiV. Based on the extensive deduced amino acid sequence analyses of a number of L proteins of non-segmented negative-strand (NNS) RNA viruses, a cluster of high-homology sequence segments have been identified within the body of the L proteins. The functional characterization of the NiV L polymerase was addressed in this research by generating a series of progressive N- deletions in the cloned gene and testing them in a minigenome assay. Five mutations that delete increasing amounts of the amino terminus of the L protein (20 amino acids) were generated at the amino-terminal. The ability of new recombinants plasmids in viral replication were tested by using minigenome system which is based on an intracellular and plasmid-based replication assay. This system contains an inserted chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, for readout of the replication of the mini genome directed by wild type or mutant L protein. The results demonstrated that the first 100 amino acids of the NH2-terminal domain spanning a highly conserved motif are directly involved in transcription of the genome RNA. The possible functional significance of the NH2-terminal domain of paramyxovirus L protein is discussed.

TI  - Functional benefit of structural disorder for the replication of measles, Nipah and Hendra viruses.
JF  - Essays in biochemistry
AB  - Measles, Nipah and Hendra viruses are severe human pathogens within the Paramyxoviridae family. Their non-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N) within a helical nucleocapsid that is the substrate used by the viral RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RpRd) for transcription and replication. The RpRd is a complex made of the large protein (L) and of the phosphoprotein (P), the latter serving as an obligate polymerase cofactor and as a chaperon for N. Both the N and P proteins are enriched in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), i.e. regions devoid of stable secondary and tertiary structure. N possesses a C-terminal IDR (NTAIL), while P consists of a large, intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD) encompassing alternating disordered and ordered regions. The V and W proteins, two non-structural proteins that are encoded by the P gene via a mechanism of co-transcriptional edition of the P mRNA, are prevalently disordered too, sharing with P the disordered NTD. They are key players in the evasion of the host antiviral response and were shown to phase separate and to form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. In this review, we summarize the available information on IDRs within the N, P, V and W proteins from these three model paramyxoviruses and describe their molecular partnership. We discuss the functional benefit of disorder to virus replication in light of the critical role of IDRs in affording promiscuity, multifunctionality, fine regulation of interaction strength, scaffolding functions and in promoting liquid-liquid phase separation and fibrillation.

AB  - Hendra virus (HeV) is an emerging paramyxovirus first isolated from cases of severe respiratory disease that fatally affected both horses and humans. Understanding the mechanisms of host cell infection and cross-species transmission is an important step in addressing the risk posed by such emerging pathogens. We have initiated studies to characterize the biological properties of the HeV envelope glycoproteins. Recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding the HeV F and G open reading frames were generated and glycoprotein expression was verified by metabolic labeling and detection using specific antisera. Glycoprotein function and cellular tropism were examined with a quantitative assay for HeV-mediated membrane fusion. Fusion specificity was verified through specific inhibition by anti-HeV antiserum and a peptide corresponding to one of the alpha-helical heptad repeats of F. HeV requires both F and G to mediate fusion. Permissive target cells have been identified, including cell lines derived from cat, bat, horse, human, monkey, mouse, and rabbit. Fusion negative cell types have also been identified. Protease treatments of the target cells abolished fusion activity, suggesting that the virus is employing a cell-surface protein as its receptor.

AB  - Nipah virus (NV) and Hendra virus (HV) are recently emergent, related viruses that can cause severe disease in humans and animals. The goal of this study was to investigate the immunogenic and functional properties of the fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins of NV. Vaccination of mice with recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVVs) expressing either the F (rVV/NV-F) or G (rVV/NV-G) proteins of NV induced neutralizing antibody responses to NV, with higher titers produced after vaccination with rVV/NV-G. When the homologous pairs of F and G proteins from either HV or NV were coexpressed in a transient expression system, fusion was detected in less than 12 h. An equivalent amount of fusion was observed when the heterologous pairs of F and G proteins from HV and NV were coexpressed. Membrane fusion was inhibited by antiserum from mice vaccinated with rVV/NV-G and rVV/NV-F. Therefore, as with other paramyxoviruses, the membrane glycoproteins of NV are the targets of neutralizing antibodies and membrane fusion mediated by NV requires the presence of both the F and the G proteins. Data from these biological assays support the taxonomic grouping of both HV and NV in the new genus, Henipavirus, within the family Paramyxoviridae.

AB  - ABSTRACT Paramyxoviruses are a large family of membrane-enveloped negative-stranded RNA viruses causing important diseases in humans and animals. Two viral integral membrane glycoproteins (fusion [F] and attachment [HN, H, or G]) mediate a concerted process of host receptor recognition, followed by the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, resulting in viral nucleocapsid entry into the cytoplasm. However, the sequence of events that closely links the timing of receptor recognition by HN, H, or G and the ‚Äútriggering‚Äù interaction of the attachment protein with F is unclear. F activation results in F undergoing a series of irreversible conformational rearrangements to bring about membrane merger and virus entry. By extensive study of properties of multiple paramyxovirus HN proteins, we show that key features of F activation, including the F-activating regions of HN proteins, flexibility within this F-activating region, and changes in globular head-stalk interactions are highly conserved. These results, together with functionally active ‚Äúheadless‚Äù mumps and Newcastle disease virus HN proteins, provide insights into the F-triggering process. Based on these data and very recently published data for morbillivirus H and henipavirus G proteins, we extend our recently proposed ‚Äústalk exposure model‚Äù to other paramyxoviruses and propose an ‚Äúinduced fit‚Äù hypothesis for F-HN/H/G interactions as conserved core mechanisms of paramyxovirus-mediated membrane fusion.

Two viral integral membrane glycoproteins (fusion [F] and attachment [HN, H, or G]) mediate a concerted process of host receptor recognition, followed by the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. We describe here the molecular mechanism by which HN activates the F protein such that virus-cell fusion is controlled and occurs at the right time and the right place.

TI  - Fusogenicity of the Ghana Virus (Henipavirus: Ghanaian bat henipavirus) Fusion Protein is Controlled by the Cytoplasmic Domain of the Attachment Glycoprotein
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 11
AB  - The Ghana virus (GhV) is phylogenetically related to the zoonotic henipaviruses Nipah (NiV) and Hendra virus. Although GhV uses the highly conserved receptor ephrin-B2, the fusogenicity is restricted to cell lines of bat origin. Furthermore, the surface expression of the GhV attachment glycoprotein (G) is reduced compared to NiV and most of this protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we generated truncated as well as chimeric GhV G proteins and investigated the influence of the structural domains (cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, ectodomain) of this protein on the intracellular transport and the fusogenicity following coexpression with the GhV fusion protein (F). We demonstrate that neither the cytoplasmic tail nor the transmembrane domain is responsible for the intracellular retention of GhV G. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic tail of GhV G modulates the fusogenicity of GhV F and therefore controls the species-restricted fusogenicity of the GhV surface glycoproteins.

TI  - Genome-wide siRNA Screening at Biosafety Level 4 Reveals a Crucial Role for Fibrillarin in Henipavirus Infection
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - Hendra and Nipah viruses (genus Henipavirus, family Paramyxoviridae) are highly pathogenic bat-borne viruses. The need for high biocontainment when studying henipaviruses has hindered the development of therapeutics and knowledge of the viral infection cycle. We have performed a genome-wide siRNA screen at biosafety level 4 that identified 585 human proteins required for henipavirus infection. The host protein with the largest impact was fibrillarin, a nucleolar methyltransferase that was also required by measles, mumps and respiratory syncytial viruses for infection. While not required for cell entry, henipavirus RNA and protein syntheses were greatly impaired in cells lacking fibrillarin, indicating a crucial role in the RNA replication phase of infection. During infection, the Hendra virus matrix protein co-localized with fibrillarin in cell nucleoli, and co-associated as a complex in pulldown studies, while its nuclear import was unaffected in fibrillarin-depleted cells. Mutagenesis studies showed that the methyltransferase activity of fibrillarin was required for henipavirus infection, suggesting that this enzyme could be targeted therapeutically to combat henipavirus infections.

TI  - HSP90 Chaperoning in Addition to Phosphoprotein Required for Folding but Not for Supporting Enzymatic Activities of Measles and Nipah Virus L Polymerases
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 6642
EP  - 6656
AB  - ABSTRACT Nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA viruses, or members of the order Mononegavirales, share a conserved gene order and the use of elaborate transcription and replication machinery made up of at least four molecular partners. These partners have coevolved with the acquisition of the permanent encapsidation of the entire genome by the nucleoprotein (N) and the use of this N-RNA complex as a template for the viral polymerase composed of the phosphoprotein (P) and the large enzymatic protein (L). Not only is P required for polymerase function, but it also stabilizes the L protein through an unknown underlying molecular mechanism. By using NVP-AUY922 and/or 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin as specific inhibitors of cellular heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), we found that efficient chaperoning of L by HSP90 requires P in the measles, Nipah, and vesicular stomatitis viruses. While the production of P remains unchanged in the presence of HSP90 inhibitors, the production of soluble and functional L requires both P and HSP90 activity. Measles virus P can bind the N terminus of L in the absence of HSP90 activity. Both HSP90 and P are required for the folding of L, as evidenced by a luciferase reporter insert fused within measles virus L. HSP90 acts as a true chaperon; its activity is transient and dispensable for the activity of measles and Nipah virus polymerases of virion origin. That the cellular chaperoning of a viral polymerase into a soluble functional enzyme requires the assistance of another viral protein constitutes a new paradigm that seems to be conserved within the Mononegavirales order. IMPORTANCE Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that require a cellular environment for their replication. Some viruses particularly depend on the cellular chaperoning apparatus. We report here that for measles virus, successful chaperoning of the viral L polymerase mediated by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) requires the presence of the viral phosphoprotein (P). Indeed, while P protein binds to the N terminus of L independently of HSP90 activity, both HSP90 and P are required to produce stable, soluble, folded, and functional L proteins. Once formed, the mature P+L complex no longer requires HSP90 to exert its polymerase functions. Such a new paradigm for the maturation of a viral polymerase appears to be conserved in several members of the Mononegavirales order, including the Nipah and vesicular stomatitis viruses.

TI  - Headless Henipaviral Receptor Binding Glycoproteins Reveal Fusion Modulation by the Head/Stalk Interface and Post-receptor Binding Contributions of the Head Domain
AB  - The Henipavirus genus in the Paramyxoviridae family includes the zoonotic Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses. NiV and HeV infections often cause fatal encephalitis and pneumonia, but no vaccines or therapeutics are currently approved for human use. ABSTRACT Cedar virus (CedV) is a nonpathogenic member of the Henipavirus (HNV) genus of emerging viruses, which includes the deadly Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses. CedV forms syncytia, a hallmark of henipaviral and paramyxoviral infections and pathogenicity. However, the intrinsic fusogenic capacity of CedV relative to NiV or HeV remains unquantified. HNV entry is mediated by concerted interactions between the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. Upon receptor binding by the HNV G head domain, a fusion-activating G stalk region is exposed and triggers F to undergo a conformational cascade that leads to viral entry or cell-cell fusion. Here, we demonstrate quantitatively that CedV is inherently significantly less fusogenic than NiV at equivalent G and F cell surface expression levels. We then generated and tested six headless CedV G mutants of distinct C-terminal stalk lengths, surprisingly revealing highly hyperfusogenic cell-cell fusion phenotypes 3- to 4-fold greater than wild-type CedV levels. Additionally, similarly to NiV, a headless HeV G mutant yielded a less pronounced hyperfusogenic phenotype compared to wild-type HeV. Further, coimmunoprecipitation and cell-cell fusion assays revealed heterotypic NiV/CedV functional G/F bidentate interactions, as well as evidence of HNV G head domain involvement beyond receptor binding or G stalk exposure. All evidence points to the G head/stalk junction being key to modulating HNV fusogenicity, supporting the notion that head domains play several distinct and central roles in modulating stalk domain fusion promotion. Further, this study exemplifies how CedV may help elucidate important mechanistic underpinnings of HNV entry and pathogenicity. IMPORTANCE The Henipavirus genus in the Paramyxoviridae family includes the zoonotic Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses. NiV and HeV infections often cause fatal encephalitis and pneumonia, but no vaccines or therapeutics are currently approved for human use. Upon viral entry, Henipavirus infections yield the formation of multinucleated cells (syncytia). Viral entry and cell-cell fusion are mediated by the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. Cedar virus (CedV), a nonpathogenic henipavirus, may be a useful tool to gain knowledge on henipaviral pathogenicity. Here, using homotypic and heterotypic full-length and headless CedV, NiV, and HeV G/F combinations, we discovered that CedV G/F are significantly less fusogenic than NiV or HeV G/F, and that the G head/stalk junction is key to modulating cell-cell fusion, refining the mechanism of henipaviral membrane fusion events. Our study exemplifies how CedV may be a useful tool to elucidate broader mechanistic understanding for the important henipaviruses.

AB  - ABSTRACT The V protein of the recently emerged paramyxovirus, Nipah virus, has been shown to inhibit interferon (IFN) signal transduction through cytoplasmic sequestration of cellular STAT1 and STAT2 in high-molecular-weight complexes. Here we demonstrate that the closely related Hendra virus V protein also inhibits cellular responses to IFN through binding and cytoplasmic sequestration of both STAT1 and STAT2, but not STAT3. These findings demonstrate a V protein-mediated IFN signal evasion mechanism that is a general property of the known Henipavirus species.

AB  - Henipaviruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens that can cause acute and severe respiratory and neurological disease in humans. The pathways by which henipaviruses enter the central nervous system (CNS) in humans are still unknown. The observation that human olfactory neurons are highly susceptible to infection with henipaviruses demonstrates that the olfactory epithelium can serve as a site of Henipavirus entry into the CNS. ABSTRACT Henipaviruses are emerging zoonotic viruses and causative agents of encephalitis in humans. However, the mechanisms of entry into the central nervous system (CNS) in humans are not known. Here, we evaluated the possible role of olfactory epithelium in virus entry into the CNS. We characterized Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) infection of primary human olfactory epithelial cultures. We show that henipaviruses can infect mature olfactory sensory neurons. Henipaviruses replicated efficiently, resulting in cytopathic effect and limited induction of host responses. These results show that human olfactory epithelium is susceptible to infection with henipaviruses, suggesting that this could be a pathway for neuroinvasion in humans.

TI  - Hendra virus fusion protein transmembrane domain contributes to pre-fusion protein stability
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 292
SP  - 5685
EP  - 5694
AB  - Enveloped viruses utilize fusion (F) proteins studding the surface of the virus to facilitate membrane fusion with a target cell membrane. Fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane is required for release of viral genomic material, so the virus can ultimately reproduce and spread. To drive fusion, the F protein undergoes an irreversible conformational change, transitioning from a metastable pre-fusion conformation to a more thermodynamically stable post-fusion structure. Understanding the elements that control stability of the pre-fusion state and triggering to the post-fusion conformation is important for understanding F protein function. Mutations in F protein transmembrane (TM) domains implicated the TM domain in the fusion process, but the structural and molecular details in fusion remain unclear. Previously, analytical ultracentrifugation was utilized to demonstrate that isolated TM domains of Hendra virus F protein associate in a monomer-trimer equilibrium (Smith, E. C., Smith, S. E., Carter, J. R., Webb, S. R., Gibson, K. M., Hellman, L. M., Fried, M. G., and Dutch, R. E. (2013) J. Biol. Chem. 288, 35726‚Äì35735). To determine factors driving this association, 140 paramyxovirus F protein TM domain sequences were analyzed. A heptad repeat of Œ≤-branched residues was found, and analysis of the Hendra virus F TM domain revealed a heptad repeat leucine-isoleucine zipper motif (LIZ). Replacement of the LIZ with alanine resulted in dramatically reduced TM-TM association. Mutation of the LIZ in the whole protein resulted in decreased protein stability, including pre-fusion conformation stability. Together, our data suggest that the heptad repeat LIZ contributed to TM-TM association and is important for F protein function and pre-fusion stability.

AB  - The genus Henipavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae includes the Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) which were discovered in the 1990s in Australia and Malaysia, respectively, after emerging to cause severe and often fatal outbreaks in humans and animals. While HeV is confined to Australia, more recent NiV outbreaks have been reported in Bangladesh, India and the Philippines. The clinical manifestations of both henipaviruses in humans appear similar, with a predominance of an acute encephalitic syndrome. Likewise, the pathological features are similar and characterized by disseminated, multi‚Äêorgan vasculopathy comprising endothelial infection/ulceration, vasculitis, vasculitis‚Äêinduced thrombosis/occlusion, parenchymal ischemia/microinfarction, and parenchymal cell infection in the central nervous system (CNS), lung, kidney and other major organs. This unique dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculitis‚Äêinduced microinfarction and neuronal infection causes severe tissue damage in the CNS. Both viruses can also cause relapsing encephalitis months and years after the acute infection. Many animal models studied to date have largely confirmed the pathology of henipavirus infection, and provided the means to test new therapeutic agents and vaccines. As the bat is the natural host of henipaviruses and has worldwide distribution, spillover events into human populations are expected to occur in the future.

TI  - Henipavirus Immune Evasion and Pathogenesis Mechanisms: Lessons Learnt from Natural Infection and Animal Models
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Nipah henipavirus (NiV) and Hendra henipavirus (HeV) are zoonotic emerging paramyxoviruses causing severe disease outbreaks in humans and livestock, mostly in Australia, India, Malaysia, Singapore and Bangladesh. Both are bat-borne viruses and in humans, their mortality rates can reach 60% in the case of HeV and 92% for NiV, thus being two of the deadliest viruses known for humans. Several factors, including a large cellular tropism and a wide zoonotic potential, con-tribute to their high pathogenicity. This review provides an overview of HeV and NiV pathogenicity mechanisms and provides a summary of their interactions with the immune systems of their different host species, including their natural hosts bats, spillover-hosts pigs, horses, and humans, as well as in experimental animal models. A better understanding of the interactions between henipaviruses and their hosts could facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies and vaccine measures against these re-emerging viruses.

TI  - Henipavirus Matrix Protein Employs a Non-Classical Nuclear Localization Signal Binding Mechanism
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are highly pathogenic species from the Henipavirus genus within the paramyxovirus family and are harbored by Pteropus Flying Fox species. Henipaviruses cause severe respiratory disease, neural symptoms, and encephalitis in various animals and humans, with human mortality rates exceeding 70% in some NiV outbreaks. The henipavirus matrix protein (M), which drives viral assembly and budding of the virion, also performs non-structural functions as a type I interferon antagonist. Interestingly, M also undergoes nuclear trafficking that mediates critical monoubiquitination for downstream cell sorting, membrane association, and budding processes. Based on the NiV and HeV M X-ray crystal structures and cell-based assays, M possesses a putative monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) (residues 82KRKKIR87; NLS1 HeV), positioned on an exposed flexible loop and typical of how many NLSs bind importin alpha (IMPŒ±), and a putative bipartite NLS (244RR-10X-KRK258; NLS2 HeV), positioned within an Œ±-helix that is far less typical. Here, we employed X-ray crystallography to determine the binding interface of these M NLSs and IMPŒ±. The interaction of both NLS peptides with IMPŒ± was established, with NLS1 binding the IMPŒ± major binding site, and NLS2 binding as a non-classical NLS to the minor site. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and immunofluorescence assays (IFA) confirm the critical role of NLS2, and specifically K258. Additionally, localization studies demonstrated a supportive role for NLS1 in M nuclear localization. These studies provide additional insight into the critical mechanisms of M nucleocytoplasmic transport, the study of which can provide a greater understanding of viral pathogenesis and uncover a potential target for novel therapeutics for henipaviral diseases.

The henipavirus G glycoprotein interacts with host cellular B class ephrins, triggering conformational alterations in G that lead to the activation of the F glycoprotein, which facilitates the membrane fusion process. Using the recently published structures of HeV-G and NiV-G and other paramyxovirus glycoproteins, we review the features of the henipavirus envelope glycoproteins that appear essential for mediating the viral fusion process, including receptor binding, G-F interaction, F activation, with an emphasis on G and the mutations that disrupt viral infectivity. Finally, recent candidate therapeutics for henipavirus-mediated disease are summarized in light of their ability to inhibit HeV and NiV entry by targeting their G and F glycoproteins.

AB  - ABSTRACT Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are deadly zoonotic viruses for which no vaccines or therapeutics are licensed for human use. Henipavirus infection causes severe respiratory illness and encephalitis. Although the exact route of transmission in human is unknown, epidemiological studies and in vivo studies suggest that the respiratory tract is important for virus replication. However, the target cells in the respiratory tract are unknown, as are the mechanisms by which henipaviruses can cause disease. In this study, we characterized henipavirus pathogenesis using primary cells derived from the human respiratory tract. The growth kinetics of NiV-Malaysia, NiV-Bangladesh, and HeV were determined in bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells (NHBE) and small airway epithelial cells (SAEC). In addition, host responses to infection were assessed by gene expression analysis and immunoassays. Viruses replicated efficiently in both cell types and induced large syncytia. The host response to henipavirus infection in NHBE and SAEC highlighted a difference in the inflammatory response between HeV and NiV strains as well as intrinsic differences in the ability to mount an inflammatory response between NHBE and SAEC. These responses were highest during HeV infection in SAEC, as characterized by the levels of key cytokines (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, IL-1Œ±, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1], and colony-stimulating factors) responsible for immune cell recruitment. Finally, we identified virus strain-dependent variability in type I interferon antagonism in NHBE and SAEC: NiV-Malaysia counteracted this pathway more efficiently than NiV-Bangladesh and HeV. These results provide crucial new information in the understanding of henipavirus pathogenesis in the human respiratory tract at an early stage of infection.

TI  - Henipavirus V Protein Association with Polo-Like Kinase Reveals Functional Overlap with STAT1 Binding and Interferon Evasion
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 82
SP  - 6259
EP  - 6271
AB  - ABSTRACT Emerging viruses in the paramyxovirus genus Henipavirus evade host antiviral responses via protein interactions between the viral V and W proteins and cellular STAT1 and STAT2 and the cytosolic RNA sensor MDA5. Polo-like kinase (PLK1) is identified as being an additional cellular partner that can bind to Nipah virus P, V, and W proteins. For both Nipah virus and Hendra virus, contact between the V protein and the PLK1 polo box domain is required for V protein phosphorylation. Results indicate that PLK1 is engaged by Nipah virus V protein amino acids 100 to 160, previously identified as being the STAT1 binding domain responsible for host interferon (IFN) signaling evasion, via a Thr-Ser-Ser-Pro motif surrounding residue 130. A distinct Ser-Thr-Pro motif surrounding residue 199 mediates the PLK1 interaction with Hendra virus V protein. Select mutations in the motif surrounding residue 130 also influenced STAT1 binding and innate immune interference, and data indicate that the V:PLK1 and V:STAT complexes are V mediated yet independent of one another. The effects of STAT1/PLK1 binding motif mutations on the function the Nipah virus P protein in directing RNA synthesis were tested. Remarkably, mutations that selectively disrupt the STAT or PLK1 interaction site have no effects on Nipah virus P protein-mediated viral RNA synthesis. Therefore, mutations targeting V protein-mediated IFN evasion will not alter the RNA synthetic capacity of the virus, supporting an attenuation strategy based on disrupting host protein interactions.

TI  - Henipavirus W Proteins Interact with 14-3-3 To Modulate Host Gene Expression
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV), members of the Henipavirus genus, are recently emerged, highly lethal zoonotic pathogens that cause yearly outbreaks. NiV and HeV each encode a W protein that has roles in regulating host signaling pathways, including antagonism of the innate immune response. However, the mechanisms used by W to regulate these host responses are not clear. Here, characterization of the interaction of NiV and HeV W with 14-3-3 identifies modulation of 14-3-3-regulated host signaling pathways not previously associated with W, suggesting new avenues of research. The cocrystal structure of the NiV W:14-3-3 complex, as only the second structure of a 14-3-3 mode III interactor, provides further insight into this less-well-understood 14-3-3 binding motif. ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV), members of the Henipavirus genus in the Paramyxoviridae family, are recently emerged, highly lethal zoonotic pathogens. The NiV and HeV nonsegmented, negative-sense RNA genomes encode nine proteins, including the W protein. Expressed from the P gene through mRNA editing, W shares a common N-terminus with P and V but has a unique C-terminus. Expressed alone, W modulates innate immune responses by several mechanisms, and elimination of W from NiV alters the course of infection in experimentally infected ferrets. However, the specific host interactions that allow W to modulate innate immunity are incompletely understood. This study demonstrates that the NiV and HeV W proteins interact with all seven isoforms of the 14-3-3 family, regulatory molecules that preferentially bind phosphorylated target proteins to regulate a wide range of cellular functions. The interaction is dependent on the penultimate amino acid residue in the W sequence, a conserved, phosphorylated serine. The cocrystal structure of the W C-terminal binding motif with 14-3-3 provides only the second structure of a complex containing a mode III interactor, which is defined as a 14-3-3 interaction with a phosphoserine/phosphothreonine at the C-termini of the target protein. Transcriptomic analysis of inducible cell lines infected with an RNA virus and expressing either wild-type W or W lacking 14-3-3 binding, identifies new functions for W. These include the regulation of cellular metabolic processes, extracellular matrix organization, and apoptosis.

TI  - Henipaviruses and lyssaviruses target nucleolar treacle protein and regulate ribosomal RNA synthesis
JF  - Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)
VL  - 24
SP  - 146
EP  - 157
AB  - The nucleolus is a common target of viruses and viral proteins, but for many viruses the functional outcomes and significance of this targeting remains unresolved. Recently, the first intranucleolar function of a protein of a cytoplasmically‚Äêreplicating negative‚Äêsense RNA virus (NSV) was identified, with the finding that the matrix (M) protein of Hendra virus (HeV) (genus Henipavirus, family Paramyxoviridae) interacts with Treacle protein within nucleolar subcompartments and mimics a cellular mechanism of the nucleolar DNA‚Äêdamage response (DDR) to suppress ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis. Whether other viruses utilise this mechanism has not been examined. We report that sub‚Äênucleolar Treacle targeting and modulation is conserved between M proteins of multiple Henipaviruses, including Nipah virus and other potentially zoonotic viruses. Furthermore, this function is also evident for P3 protein of rabies virus, the prototype virus of a different RNA virus family (Rhabdoviridae), with Treacle depletion in cells also found to impact virus production. These data indicate that unrelated proteins of viruses from different families have independently developed nucleolar/Treacle targeting function, but that modulation of Treacle has distinct effects on infection. Thus, subversion of Treacle may be an important process in infection by diverse NSVs, and so could provide novel targets for antiviral approaches with broad specificity.

TI  - Heparan Sulfate-Dependent Enhancement of Henipavirus Infection
JF  - mBio
VL  - 6
AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus and Hendra virus are emerging, highly pathogenic, zoonotic paramyxoviruses that belong to the genus Henipavirus. They infect humans as well as numerous mammalian species. Both viruses use ephrin-B2 and -B3 as cell entry receptors, and following initial entry into an organism, they are capable of rapid spread throughout the host. We have previously reported that Nipah virus can use another attachment receptor, different from its entry receptors, to bind to nonpermissive circulating leukocytes, thereby promoting viral dissemination within the host. Here, this attachment molecule was identified as heparan sulfate for both Nipah virus and Hendra virus. Cells devoid of heparan sulfate were not able to mediate henipavirus trans-infection and showed reduced permissivity to infection. Virus pseudotyped with Nipah virus glycoproteins bound heparan sulfate and heparin but no other glycosaminoglycans in a surface plasmon resonance assay. Furthermore, heparin was able to inhibit the interaction of the viruses with the heparan sulfate and to block cell-mediated trans-infection of henipaviruses. Moreover, heparin was shown to bind to ephrin-B3 and to restrain infection of permissive cells in vitro. Consequently, treatment with heparin devoid of anticoagulant activity improved the survival of Nipah virus-infected hamsters. Altogether, these results reveal heparan sulfate as a new attachment receptor for henipaviruses and as a potential therapeutic target for the development of novel approaches against these highly lethal infections. IMPORTANCE The Henipavirus genus includes two closely related, highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses, Nipah virus and Hendra virus, which cause elevated morbidity and mortality in animals and humans. Pathogenesis of both Nipah virus and Hendra virus infection is poorly understood, and efficient antiviral treatment is still missing. Here, we identified heparan sulfate as a novel attachment receptor used by both viruses to bind host cells. We demonstrate that heparin was able to inhibit the interaction of the viruses with heparan sulfate and to block cell-mediated trans-infection of henipaviruses. Moreover, heparin also bound to the viral entry receptor and thereby restricted infection of permissive cells in vitro. Consequently, heparin treatment improved survival of Nipah virus-infected hamsters. These results uncover an important role of heparan sulfate in henipavirus infection and open novel perspectives for the development of heparan sulfate-targeting therapeutic approaches for these emerging infections.

TI  - Host cell recognition by the henipaviruses: Crystal structures of the Nipah G attachment glycoprotein and its complex with ephrin-B3
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 105
SP  - 9953
EP  - 9958
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus are the type species of the highly pathogenic paramyxovirus genus Henipavirus, which can cause severe respiratory disease and fatal encephalitis infections in humans, with case fatality rates approaching 75%. NiV contains two envelope glycoproteins, the receptor-binding G glycoprotein (NiV-G) that facilitates attachment to host cells and the fusion (F) glycoprotein that mediates membrane merger. The henipavirus G glycoproteins lack both hemagglutinating and neuraminidase activities and, instead, engage the highly conserved ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 cell surface proteins as their entry receptors. Here, we report the crystal structures of the NiV-G both in its receptor-unbound state and in complex with ephrin-B3, providing, to our knowledge, the first view of a paramyxovirus attachment complex in which a cellular protein is used as the virus receptor. Complex formation generates an extensive protein‚Äìprotein interface around a protruding ephrin loop, which is inserted in the central cavity of the NiV-G Œ≤-propeller. Analysis of the structural data reveals the molecular basis for the highly specific interactions of the henipavirus G glycoproteins with only two members (ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3) of the very large ephrin family and suggests how they mediate in a unique fashion both cell attachment and the initiation of membrane fusion during the virus infection processes. The structures further suggest that the NiV-G/ephrin interactions can be effectively targeted to disrupt viral entry and provide the foundation for structure-based antiviral drug design.

JF  - Viral immunology
VL  - 17 2
SP  - 210
EP  - 9
AB  - Interferon (IFN) can activate Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) proteins to establish a cellular antiviral response and inhibit virus replication. Many viruses have evolved strategies to inhibit this antiviral mechanism, but paramyxoviruses are unique in their abilities to directly target the IFN-responsive STAT proteins. Hendra virus and Nipah virus (Henipaviruses) are recently emerged paramyxoviruses that are the causative agents of fatal disease outbreaks in Australia and peninsular Malaysia. Similar to other paramyxoviruses, Henipaviruses inhibit IFN signal transduction through a virus-encoded protein called V. Recent studies have shown that Henipavirus V proteins target STAT proteins by inducing the formation of cytoplasmically localized high molecular weight STAT-containing complexes. This sequestration of STAT1 and STAT2 prevents STAT activation and blocks antiviral IFN signaling. As the V proteins are important factors for host evasion, they represent logical targets for therapeutics directed against Henipavirus epidemics.

TI  - Human Paramyxovirus Infections Induce T Cells That Cross-React with Zoonotic Henipaviruses
JF  - mBio
VL  - 11
AB  - Humans encounter multiple paramyxoviruses early in life. This study shows that infection with common paramyxoviruses can induce T cells cross-reactive with the highly pathogenic Nipah virus. This demonstrates that the combination of paramyxovirus infection history and HLA haplotype affects immunity to phylogenetically related zoonotic paramyxoviruses. ABSTRACT Humans are infected with paramyxoviruses of different genera early in life, which induce cytotoxic T cells that may recognize conserved epitopes. This raises the question of whether cross-reactive T cells induced by antecedent paramyxovirus infections provide partial protection against highly lethal zoonotic Nipah virus infections. By characterizing a measles virus-specific but paramyxovirus cross-reactive human T cell clone, we discovered a highly conserved HLA-B*1501-restricted T cell epitope in the fusion protein. Using peptides, tetramers, and single cell sorting, we isolated a parainfluenza virus-specific T cell clone from a healthy adult and showed that both clones cleared Nipah virus-infected cells. We identified multiple conserved hot spots in paramyxovirus proteomes that contain other potentially cross-reactive epitopes. Our data suggest that, depending on HLA haplotype and history of paramyxovirus exposures, humans may have cross-reactive T cells that provide protection against Nipah virus. The effect of preferential boosting of these cross-reactive epitopes needs to be further studied in light of paramyxovirus vaccination studies.

TI  - ILRUN Downregulates ACE2 Expression and Blocks Infection of Human Cells by SARS-CoV-2
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - There is no doubt that the current rapid global spread of COVID-19 has had significant and far-reaching impacts on our health and economy and will continue to do so. Research in emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is growing rapidly, with new breakthroughs in the understanding of host-virus interactions to assist with the development of innovative and exciting therapeutic strategies. ABSTRACT The human protein-coding gene ILRUN (inflammation and lipid regulator with UBA-like and NBR1-like domains; previously C6orf106) was identified as a proviral factor for Hendra virus infection and was recently characterized to function as an inhibitor of type I interferon expression. Here, we have utilized transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to define cellular pathways regulated by ILRUN in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of Caco-2 cells. We find that inhibition of ILRUN expression by RNA interference alters transcription profiles of numerous cellular pathways, including upregulation of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and several other members of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system. In addition, transcripts of the SARS-CoV-2 coreceptors TMPRSS2 and CTSL were also upregulated. Inhibition of ILRUN also resulted in increased SARS-CoV-2 replication, while overexpression of ILRUN had the opposite effect, identifying ILRUN as a novel antiviral factor for SARS-CoV-2 replication. This represents, to our knowledge, the first report of ILRUN as a regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). IMPORTANCE There is no doubt that the current rapid global spread of COVID-19 has had significant and far-reaching impacts on our health and economy and will continue to do so. Research in emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is growing rapidly, with new breakthroughs in the understanding of host-virus interactions to assist with the development of innovative and exciting therapeutic strategies. Here, we present the first evidence that modulation of the human protein-coding gene ILRUN functions as an antiviral factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, likely through its newly identified role in regulating the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL. These data improve our understanding of biological pathways that regulate host factors critical to SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the development of antiviral strategies to deal with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

TI  - Identification of Hendra Virus G Glycoprotein Residues That Are Critical for Receptor Binding
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 5893
EP  - 5901
AB  - ABSTRACT Hendra virus (HeV) is an emerging paramyxovirus capable of infecting and causing disease in a variety of mammalian species, including humans. The virus infects its host cells through the coordinated functions of its fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins, the latter of which is responsible for binding the virus receptors ephrinB2 and ephrinB3. In order to identify the receptor binding site, a panel of G glycoprotein constructs containing mutations was generated using an alanine-scanning mutagenesis strategy. Based on a predicted G structure, charged amino acids residing in regions that could be homologous to those in the measles virus H attachment glycoprotein known to be involved in its protein receptor interaction were targeted. Using a coprecipitation-based assay, seven single-amino-acid substitutions in HeV G were identified as having significantly impaired binding to both the ephrinB2 and ephrinB3 viral receptors: D257A, D260A, G439A, K443A, G449A, K465A, and D468A. The impairment of receptor interaction conferred a concomitant diminution in their abilities to promote membrane fusion when coexpressed with F. The G glycoprotein mutants were also recognized by three or more conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies of a panel of five, were expressed on the cell surface, and retained their abilities to bind and coprecipitate F. Interestingly, some of these mutant G glycoproteins coprecipitated with F more efficiently than wild-type G. Taken together, these data provide strong biochemical and functional evidence that some of these residues could be part of a conformation-dependent, discontinuous, and overlapping ephrinB2 and -B3 binding domain within the HeV G glycoprotein.

TI  - Identification of a Region in the Common Amino-terminal Domain of Hendra Virus P, V, and W Proteins Responsible for Phase Transition and Amyloid Formation
JF  - Biomolecules
VL  - 11
AB  - Henipaviruses are BSL-4 zoonotic pathogens responsible in humans for severe encephalitis. Their V protein is a key player in the evasion of the host innate immune response. We previously showed that the Henipavirus V proteins consist of a long intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (NTD) and a Œ≤-enriched C-terminal domain (CTD). These terminals are critical for V binding to DDB1, which is a cellular protein that is a component of the ubiquitin ligase E3 complex, as well as binding to MDA5 and LGP2, which are two host sensors of viral RNA. Here, we serendipitously discovered that the Hendra virus V protein undergoes a liquid-to-hydrogel phase transition and identified the V region responsible for this phenomenon. This region, referred to as PNT3 and encompassing residues 200‚Äì310, was further investigated using a combination of biophysical and structural approaches. Congo red binding assays, together with negative-staining transmisison electron microscopy (TEM) studies, show that PNT3 forms amyloid-like fibrils. Fibrillation abilities are dramatically reduced in a rationally designed PNT3 variant in which a stretch of three contiguous tyrosines, falling within an amyloidogenic motif, were replaced by three alanines. Worthy to note, Congo red staining experiments provided hints that these amyloid-like fibrils form not only in vitro but also in cellula after transfection or infection. The present results set the stage for further investigations aimed at assessing the functional role of phase separation and fibrillation by the Henipavirus V proteins.

TI  - Identification of a Region in the Stalk Domain of the Nipah Virus Receptor Binding Protein That Is Critical for Fusion Activation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 10980
EP  - 10996
AB  - ABSTRACT Paramyxoviruses, including the emerging lethal human Nipah virus (NiV) and the avian Newcastle disease virus (NDV), enter host cells through fusion of the viral and target cell membranes. For paramyxoviruses, membrane fusion is the result of the concerted action of two viral envelope glycoproteins: a receptor binding protein and a fusion protein (F). The NiV receptor binding protein (G) attaches to ephrin B2 or B3 on host cells, whereas the corresponding hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) attachment protein of NDV interacts with sialic acid moieties on target cells through two regions of its globular domain. Receptor-bound G or HN via its stalk domain triggers F to undergo the conformational changes that render it competent to mediate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. We show that chimeric proteins containing the NDV HN receptor binding regions and the NiV G stalk domain require a specific sequence at the connection between the head and the stalk to activate NiV F for fusion. Our findings are consistent with a general mechanism of paramyxovirus fusion activation in which the stalk domain of the receptor binding protein is responsible for F activation and a specific connecting region between the receptor binding globular head and the fusion-activating stalk domain is required for transmitting the fusion signal.

TI  - Identification of the Nuclear Export Signal and STAT-Binding Domains of the Nipah Virus V Protein Reveals Mechanisms Underlying Interferon Evasion
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 5358
EP  - 5367
AB  - ABSTRACT The V proteins of Nipah virus and Hendra virus have been demonstrated to bind to cellular STAT1 and STAT2 proteins to form high-molecular-weight complexes that inhibit interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral transcription by preventing STAT nuclear accumulation. Analysis of the Nipah virus V protein has revealed a region between amino acids 174 and 192 that functions as a CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES). This peptide is sufficient to complement an export-defective human immunodeficiency virus Rev protein, and deletion and substitution mutagenesis revealed that this peptide is necessary for both V protein shuttling and cytoplasmic retention of STAT1 and STAT2 proteins. However, the NES is not required for V-dependent IFN signaling inhibition. IFN signaling is blocked primarily by interaction between Nipah virus V residues 100 to 160 and STAT1 residues 509 to 712. Interaction with STAT2 requires a larger Nipah virus V segment between amino acids 100 and 300, but deletion of residues 230 to 237 greatly reduced STAT2 coprecipitation. Further, V protein interactions with cellular STAT1 is a prerequisite for STAT2 binding, and sequential immunoprecipitations demonstrate that V, STAT1, and STAT2 can form a tripartite complex. These findings characterize essential regions for Henipavirus V proteins that represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Immune correlates of protection for SARS-CoV-2, Ebola and Nipah virus infection
JF  - Frontiers in Immunology
VL  - 14
AB  - Correlates of protection (CoP) are biological parameters that predict a certain level of protection against an infectious disease. Well-established correlates of protection facilitate the development and licensing of vaccines by assessing protective efficacy without the need to expose clinical trial participants to the infectious agent against which the vaccine aims to protect. Despite the fact that viruses have many features in common, correlates of protection can vary considerably amongst the same virus family and even amongst a same virus depending on the infection phase that is under consideration. Moreover, the complex interplay between the various immune cell populations that interact during infection and the high degree of genetic variation of certain pathogens, renders the identification of immune correlates of protection difficult. Some emerging and re-emerging viruses of high consequence for public health such as SARS-CoV-2, Nipah virus (NiV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) are especially challenging with regards to the identification of CoP since these pathogens have been shown to dysregulate the immune response during infection. Whereas, virus neutralising antibodies and polyfunctional T-cell responses have been shown to correlate with certain levels of protection against SARS-CoV-2, EBOV and NiV, other effector mechanisms of immunity play important roles in shaping the immune response against these pathogens, which in turn might serve as alternative correlates of protection. This review describes the different components of the adaptive and innate immune system that are activated during SARS-CoV-2, EBOV and NiV infections and that may contribute to protection and virus clearance. Overall, we highlight the immune signatures that are associated with protection against these pathogens in humans and could be used as CoP.

VL  - 19 2

EP  - 34
AB  - Morbillivirus infections have been known for a long time to be associated with an acute immunosuppression in their natural hosts. Here, we show that recombinant Morbillivirus nucleoproteins from canine distemper virus, peste-des-petits-ruminants virus, and Rinderpest virus bind B-lymphocytes from dogs, goats, and cattle, respectively, similarly to measles virus nucleoprotein in humans. The use of surface plasmon resonance imaging allowed the real time detection of differential interactions between Morbillivirus nucleoproteins and FcgammaRIIb (CD32). Moreover, those nucleoproteins which bind murine Fcgamma receptor inhibited the inflammatory immune responses in mice in a Fc receptor- dependent manner. In contrast, nucleoprotein from closely related Henipavirus genus, belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family as Morbillivirus, was devoid of capacity either to bind FcgammaRIIb or to inhibit inflammatory response. Altogether, these results suggest that nucleoprotein-FcR interaction is a common mechanism used by different Morbilliviruses to modulate the immune response.

TI  - Immunopathogenesis of Nipah Virus Infection and Associated Immune Responses
JF  - Immuno
AB  - Pandemics in the last two centuries have been initiated by causal pathogens that include Severe Acute Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Influenza (e.g., the H1N1 pandemic of 2009). The latter is considered to have initiated two prior pandemics in 1918 and 1977, known as the ‚ÄúSpanish Flu‚Äù and ‚ÄúRussian Flu‚Äù, respectively. Here, we discuss other emerging infections that could be potential public health threats. These include Henipaviruses, which are members of the family Paramyxoviridae that infect bats and other mammals. Paramyxoviridae also include Parainfluenza and Mumps viruses (Rubulavirus) but also Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) (Pneumovirus). Additionally included is the Measles virus, recorded for the first time in writing in 1657 (Morbillivirus). In humans and animals, these may cause encephalitis or respiratory diseases. Recently, two more highly pathogenic class 4 viral pathogens emerged. These were named Hendra Henipavirus (HeV) and Nipah Henipavirus (NiV). Nipah virus is a negative-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid ((‚àí) ssRNA) virus within the family Paramyxoviridae. There are currently no known therapeutics or treatment regimens licensed as effective in humans, with development ongoing. Nipah virus is a lethal emerging zoonotic disease that has been neglected since its characterization in 1999 until recently. Nipah virus infection occurs predominantly in isolated regions of Malaysia, Bangladesh, and India in small outbreaks. Factors that affect animal‚Äìhuman disease transmission include viral mutation, direct contact, amplifying reservoirs, food, close contact, and host cell mutations. There are different strains of Nipah virus, and small outbreaks in humans limit known research and surveillance on this pathogen. The small size of outbreaks in rural areas is suggestive of low transmission. Person-to-person transmission may occur. The role that zoonotic (animal‚Äìhuman) or host immune system cellular factors perform therefore requires analysis. Mortality estimates for NiV infection range from 38‚Äì100% (averaging 58.2% in early 2019). It is therefore critical to outline treatments and prevention for NiV disease in future research. The final stages of the disease severely affect key organ systems, particularly the central nervous system and brain. Therefore, here we clarify the pathogenesis, biochemical mechanisms, and all research in context with known immune cell proteins and genetic factors.

TI  - Importance of Endocytosis for the Biological Activity of Cedar Virus Fusion Protein
JF  - Cells
VL  - 9
AB  - Endocytosis plays a particular role in the proteolytic activation of highly pathogenic henipaviruses Hendra (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) fusion (F) protein precursors. These proteins require endocytic uptake from the cell surface to be cleaved by cellular proteases within the endosomal compartment, followed by recycling to the plasma membrane for incorporation into budding virions or mediation of cell-cell fusion. This internalization largely depends on a tyrosine-based consensus motif for endocytosis present in the cytoplasmic tail of HeV and NiV F. Given the large number of tyrosine residues present in the F protein cytoplasmic domain of Cedar virus (CedV), a closely related but low pathogenic henipavirus, we aimed to investigate whether CedV F protein undergoes signal-mediated endocytosis from the cell surface controlled by tyrosine-based motifs present in its cytoplasmic tail and whether endocytosis is relevant for its biological activity. Therefore, tyrosine-based signals were mutated, and mutations were assessed for their effect on F cell surface expression, endocytosis, and biological activity. A membrane-proximal YXXŒ¶ motif and a C-terminal di-tyrosine motif are of particular importance for cell surface expression and endocytosis rate. Furthermore, our data strongly indicate the pivotal role of endocytosis for the biological activity of the CedV F protein.

TI  - Independent Structural Domains in Paramyxovirus Polymerase Protein*

VL  - 287
SP  - 6878
EP  - 6891
AB  - Background: RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses (Mononegavirales) harbor multiple catalytic activities. Results: Domain screening and trans-complementation of Paramyxovirus polymerase fragments with dimerization tags identifies independent folding-competent domains. Conclusion: Paramyxovirus polymerases harbor at least two independent domains that lack high-affinity interfaces but require molecular compatibility for bioactivity. Significance: First demonstration of Mononegavirales polymerase trans-complementation sets the stage for structural analyses of folding domains. All enzymatic activities required for genomic replication and transcription of nonsegmented negative strand RNA viruses (or Mononegavirales) are believed to be concentrated in the viral polymerase (L) protein. However, our insight into the organization of these different enzymatic activities into a bioactive tertiary structure remains rudimentary. Fragments of Mononegavirales polymerases analyzed to date cannot restore bioactivity through trans-complementation, unlike the related L proteins of segmented NSVs. We investigated the domain organization of phylogenetically diverse Paramyxovirus L proteins derived from measles virus (MeV), Nipah virus (NiV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Through a comprehensive in silico and experimental analysis of domain intersections, we defined MeV L position 615 as an interdomain candidate in addition to the previously reported residue 1708. Only position 1708 of MeV and the homologous positions in NiV and RSV L also tolerated the insertion of epitope tags. Splitting of MeV L at residue 1708 created fragments that were unable to physically interact and trans-complement, but strikingly, these activities were reconstituted by the addition of dimerization tags to the fragments. Equivalently split fragments of NiV, RSV, and MeV L oligomerized with comparable efficiency in all homo- and heterotypic combinations, but only the homotypic pairs were able to trans-complement. These results demonstrate that synthesis as a single polypeptide is not required for the Mononegavirales polymerases to adopt a proper tertiary conformation. Paramyxovirus polymerases are composed of at least two truly independent folding domains that lack a traditional interface but require molecular compatibility for bioactivity. The functional probing of the L domain architecture through trans-complementation is anticipated to be applicable to all Mononegavirales polymerases.

TI  - Individual N-Glycans Added at Intervals along the Stalk of the Nipah Virus G Protein Prevent Fusion but Do Not Block the Interaction with the Homologous F Protein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 3119
EP  - 3129
AB  - ABSTRACT The promotion of membrane fusion by most paramyxoviruses requires an interaction between the viral attachment and fusion (F) proteins to enable receptor binding by the former to trigger the activation of the latter for fusion. Numerous studies demonstrate that the F-interactive sites on the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and measles virus (MV) hemagglutinin (H) proteins reside entirely within the stalk regions of those proteins. Indeed, stalk residues of NDV HN and MV H that likely mediate the F interaction have been identified. However, despite extensive efforts, the F-interactive site(s) on the Nipah virus (NiV) G attachment glycoprotein has not been identified. In this study, we have introduced individual N-linked glycosylation sites at several positions spaced at intervals along the stalk of the NiV G protein. Five of the seven introduced sites are utilized as established by a retardation of electrophoretic mobility. Despite surface expression, ephrinB2 binding, and oligomerization comparable to those of the wild-type protein, four of the five added N-glycans completely eliminate the ability of the G protein to complement the homologous F protein in the promotion of fusion. The most membrane-proximal added N-glycan reduces fusion by 80%. However, unlike similar NDV HN and MV H mutants, the NiV G glycosylation stalk mutants retain the ability to bind F, indicating that the fusion deficiency of these mutants is not due to prevention of the G-F interaction. These findings suggest that the G-F interaction is not mediated entirely by the stalk domain of G and may be more complex than that of HN/H-F.

EP  - 7278
AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV), a new member of the Paramyxoviridae, codes for a fusion (F) protein with five potential N-glycosylation sites. Because glycans are known to be important structural components affecting the conformation and function of viral glycoproteins, we analyzed the effect of the deletion of N-linked oligosaccharides on cell surface transport, proteolytic cleavage, and the biological activity of the NiV F protein. Each of the five potential glycosylation sites was removed either individually or in combination, revealing that four sites are actually utilized (g2 and g3 in the F2 subunit and g4 and g5 in the F1 subunit). While the removal of g2 and/or g3 had no or little effect on cleavage, surface transport, and fusion activity, the elimination of g4 or g5 reduced the surface expression by more than 80%. Similar to a mutant lacking all N-glycans, g4 deletion mutants in which the potential glycosylation site was destroyed by introducing a glycine residue were neither cleaved nor transported to the cell surface and consequently were not able to mediate cell-to-cell fusion. This finding indicates that in the absence of g4, the amino acid sequence around position 414 is important for folding and transport.

VL  - 86

EP  - 7145
AB  - ABSTRACT The V protein of Sendai virus (SeV) suppresses innate immunity, resulting in enhancement of viral growth in mouse lungs and viral pathogenicity. The innate immunity restricted by the V protein is induced through activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). The V protein has been shown to interact with melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and to inhibit beta interferon production. In the present study, we infected MDA5-knockout mice with V-deficient SeV and found that MDA5 was largely unrelated to the innate immunity that the V protein suppresses in vivo. We therefore investigated the target of the SeV V protein. We previously reported interaction of the V protein with IRF3. Here we extended the observation and showed that the V protein appeared to inhibit translocation of IRF3 into the nucleus. We also found that the V protein inhibited IRF3 activation when induced by a constitutive active form of IRF3. The V proteins of measles virus and Newcastle disease virus inhibited IRF3 transcriptional activation, as did the V protein of SeV, while the V proteins of mumps virus and Nipah virus did not, and inhibition by these proteins correlated with interaction of each V protein with IRF3. These results indicate that IRF3 is important as an alternative target of paramyxovirus V proteins.

AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are newly identified members of the family Paramyxoviridae and have been classified in the new genus Henipavirus based on unique genetic characteristics distinct from other paramyxoviruses. Transgenic cell lines were generated that expressed either the attachment protein (G) or the fusion protein (F) of NiV. Functional expression of NiV F and G was verified by complementation with the corresponding glycoprotein, which resulted in the development of syncytia. When exposed to NiV and HeV, expression of NiV G in Crandall feline kidney cells resulted in a qualitative inhibition of both cytopathic effect (CPE) and cell death by both viruses. RT-PCR analysis of surviving exposed cells showed a complete absence of viral positive-sense mRNA and genomic negative-sense viral RNA. Cells expressing NiV G were also unable to fuse with cells co-expressing NiV F and G in a fluorescent fusion inhibition assay. Cell-surface staining for the cellular receptors for NiV and HeV (ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3) indicated that they were located on the surface of cells, regardless of NiV G expression or infection by NiV. These results indicated that viral interference can be established for henipaviruses and requires only the expression of the attachment protein, G. Furthermore, it was found that this interference probably occurs at the level of virus entry, as fusion was not observed in cells expressing NiV G. Finally, expression of NiV G by either transient transfection or NiV infection did not alter the cell-surface levels of the two known viral receptors.

TI  - Initiation, extension, and termination of RNA synthesis by a paramyxovirus polymerase
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 14
AB  - Paramyxoviruses represent a family of RNA viruses causing significant human diseases. These include measles virus, the most infectious virus ever reported, in addition to parainfluenza virus, and other emerging viruses. Paramyxoviruses likely share common replication machinery but their mechanisms of RNA biosynthesis activities and details of their complex polymerase structures are unknown. Mechanistic and functional details of a paramyxovirus polymerase would have sweeping implications for understanding RNA virus replication and for the development of new antiviral medicines. To study paramyxovirus polymerase structure and function, we expressed an active recombinant Nipah virus (NiV) polymerase complex assembled from the multifunctional NiV L protein bound to its phosphoprotein cofactor. NiV is an emerging highly pathogenic virus that causes severe encephalitis and has been declared a global public health concern due to its high mortality rate. Using negative-stain electron microscopy, we demonstrated NiV polymerase forms ring-like particles resembling related RNA polymerases. We identified conserved sequence elements driving recognition of the 3‚Ä≤-terminal genomic promoter by NiV polymerase, and leading to initiation of RNA synthesis, primer extension, and transition to elongation mode. Polyadenylation resulting from NiV polymerase stuttering provides a mechanistic basis for transcription termination. It also suggests a divergent adaptation in promoter recognition between pneumo- and paramyxoviruses. The lack of available antiviral therapy for NiV prompted us to identify the triphosphate forms of R1479 and GS-5734, two clinically relevant nucleotide analogs, as substrates and inhibitors of NiV polymerase activity by delayed chain termination. Overall, these findings provide low-resolution structural details and the mechanism of an RNA polymerase from a previously uncharacterized virus family. This work illustrates important functional differences yet remarkable similarities between the polymerases of nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses.

TI  - Insights into Paramyxovirus Nucleocapsids from Diverse Assemblies
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - All paramyxoviruses, which include the mumps virus, measles virus, Nipah virus, Newcastle disease virus, and Sendai virus, have non-segmented single-stranded negative-sense RNA genomes. These RNA genomes are enwrapped throughout the viral life cycle by nucleoproteins, forming helical nucleocapsids. In addition to these helical structures, recombinant paramyxovirus nucleocapsids may occur in other assembly forms such as rings, clam-shaped structures, and double-headed nucleocapsids; the latter two are composed of two single-stranded helices packed in a back-to-back pattern. In all of these assemblies, the neighboring nucleoprotein protomers adopt the same domain-swapping mode via the N-terminal arm, C-terminal arm, and recently disclosed N-hole. An intrinsically disordered region in the C-terminal domain of the nucleoproteins, called the N-tail, plays an unexpected role in regulating the transition among the different assembly forms that occurs with other viral proteins, especially phosphoprotein. These structures, together with the helical nucleocapsids, significantly enrich the structural diversity of the paramyxovirus nucleocapsids and help explain the functions of these diverse assemblies, including RNA genome protection, transcription, and replication, as well as encapsulation.

TI  - Interaction of host cellular factor ANP32B with matrix proteins of different paramyxoviruses.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
AB  - Although most non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses (NNSVs) replicate in the cytoplasm, NNSV proteins often exert host manipulatory functions in the nucleus. Matrix (M) proteins of henipaviruses and other paramyxoviruses shuttle through the nucleus, where host factors may bind for M modification or host-cell manipulation. Acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member B (ANP32B) is an interactor of Hendra and Nipah virus M. Both accumulate in the nucleus in an ANP32B-dependent manner. Here we demonstrate that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of ANP32B is dispensable for HeV M binding. Specific purification of M-ANP32B but not of M-ANP32A complexes revealed that neither the negatively charged acidic nor the leucine-rich regions of ANP32 proteins per se mediate interactions with henipavirus M proteins. Whereas pneumovirus M did not interact with ANP32B, Newcastle disease virus (NDV, genus Avulavirus), Sendai virus (SeV, genus Respirovirus), Measles virus (MeV, genus Morbillivirus) and Canine distemper virus (CDV, genus Morbillivirus) M were able to form complexes with ANP32B. However, in contrast to NDV M and SeV M, which accumulated in the nucleus ANP32B dependently, both morbillivirus Ms did not accumulate in the nucleus, neither at ANP32B overexpression nor after nuclear protein export inhibition. These results indicate that intracellular compartmentalization of cytoplasmic morbillivirus M and nuclear ANP32B prevented an intracellular interaction. Overall, we provide evidence for a general ability of paramyxovirus M proteins to interact with ANP32B. This suggests a conserved, yet to be clarified mechanism might play a role in host manipulation and immune regulation in infected hosts.

TI  - Interactions of Human Complement with Virus Particles Containing the Nipah Virus Glycoproteins
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 5940
EP  - 5948
AB  - ABSTRACT Complement is an innate immune response system that most animal viruses encounter during natural infections. We have tested the role of human complement in the neutralization of virus particles harboring the Nipah virus (NiV) glycoproteins. A luciferase-expressing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype that contained the NiV fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins (NiVpp) showed dose- and time-dependent activation of human complement through the alternative pathway. In contrast to our findings with other paramyxoviruses, normal human serum (NHS) alone did not neutralize NiVpp infectivity in vitro, and electron microscopy demonstrated no significant deposition of complement component C3 on particles. This lack of NiVpp neutralization by NHS was not due to a global inhibition of complement pathways, since complement was found to significantly enhance neutralization by antibodies specific for the NiV F and G glycoproteins. Complement components C4 and C1q were necessary but not sufficient by themselves for the enhancement of antibody neutralization. Human complement also enhanced NiVpp neutralization by a soluble version of the NiV receptor EphrinB2, and this depended on components in the classical pathway. The ability of complement to enhance neutralization fell into one of two profiles: (i) anti-F monoclonal antibodies showed enhancement only at high and not low antibody concentrations, and (ii) anti-G monoclonal antibodies and EphrinB2 showed enhancement at both high and very low levels of antibody (e.g., 3.1 ng) or EphrinB2 (e.g., 2.5 ng). Together, these data establish the importance of human complement in the neutralization of particles containing the NiV glycoproteins and will help guide the design of more effective therapeutics that harness the potency of complement pathways.

TI  - Interactions of the Nipah Virus P, V, and W Proteins across the STAT Family of Transcription Factors
JF  - mSphere
VL  - 5
AB  - How Nipah virus (NiV) antagonizes innate immune responses is incompletely understood. The P gene of NiV encodes the P, V, and W proteins. ABSTRACT The Nipah virus (NiV) phosphoprotein (P) gene encodes four proteins. Three of these‚ÄîP, V, and W‚Äîpossess a common N-terminal domain but distinct C termini. These proteins interact with immune modulators. Previous studies demonstrated that P, V, and W bind STAT1 and STAT4 and that V also interacts with STAT2 but not with STAT3. The STAT1 and STAT2 interactions block interferon (IFN)-induced STAT tyrosine phosphorylation. To more fully characterize the interactions of P, V, and W with the STATs, we screened for interaction of each viral protein with STATs 1 to 6 by coimmunoprecipitation. We demonstrate that NiV P, V, and W interact with STAT4 through their common N-terminal domain and block STAT4 activity, based on a STAT4 response element reporter assay. Although none of the NiV proteins interact with STAT3 or STAT6, NiV V, but not P or W, interacts with STAT5 through its unique C terminus. Furthermore, the interaction of NiV V with STAT5 was not disrupted by overexpression of the N-terminal binding STAT1 or the C-terminal binding MDA5. NiV V also inhibits a STAT5 response element reporter assay. Residues 114 to 140 of the common N-terminal domain of the NiV P gene products were found to be sufficient to bind STAT1 and STAT4. Analysis of STAT1-STAT3 chimeras suggests that the P gene products target the STAT1 SH2 domain. When fused to GST, the 114-140 peptide is sufficient to decrease STAT1 phosphorylation in IFN-Œ≤-stimulated cells, suggesting that this peptide could potentially be fused to heterologous proteins to confer inhibition of STAT1- and STAT4-dependent responses. IMPORTANCE How Nipah virus (NiV) antagonizes innate immune responses is incompletely understood. The P gene of NiV encodes the P, V, and W proteins. These proteins have a common N-terminal sequence that is sufficient to bind to STAT1 and STAT2 and block IFN-induced signal transduction. This study sought to more fully understand how P, V, and W engage with the STAT family of transcription factors to influence their functions. The results identify a novel interaction of V with STAT5 and demonstrate V inhibition of STAT5 function. We also demonstrate that the common N-terminal residues 114 to 140 of P, V, and W are critical for inhibition of STAT1 and STAT4 function, map the interaction to the SH2 region of STAT1, and show that a fusion construct with this peptide significantly inhibits cytokine-induced STAT1 phosphorylation. These data clarify how these important virulence factors modulate innate antiviral defenses.

TI  - Interferon Production and Signaling Pathways Are Antagonized during Henipavirus Infection of Fruit Bat Cell Lines
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 6
AB  - Bats are natural reservoirs for a spectrum of infectious zoonotic diseases including the recently emerged henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah viruses). Henipaviruses have been observed both naturally and experimentally to cause serious and often fatal disease in many different mammal species, including humans. Interestingly, infection of the flying fox with henipaviruses occurs in the absence of clinical disease. The extreme variation in the disease pattern between humans and bats has led to an investigation into the effects of henipavirus infection on the innate immune response in bat cell lines. We report that henipavirus infection does not result in the induction of interferon expression, and the viruses also inhibit interferon signaling. We also confirm that the interferon production and signaling block in bat cells is not due to differing viral protein expression levels between human and bat hosts. This information, in addition to the known lack of clinical signs in bats following henipavirus infection, suggests that bats control henipavirus infection by an as yet unidentified mechanism, not via the interferon response. This is the first report of henipavirus infection in bat cells specifically investigating aspects of the innate immune system.

AB  - ABSTRACT Henipaviruses encode several proteins from the P gene, of which V and W have been demonstrated by gene-based transfection studies to antagonize the innate immune response, blocking both type I interferon production and signaling. This study examines the effects of henipavirus infection on the innate immune response in human cell lines. We report that henipavirus infection does not result in interferon production, with the virus antagonizing this response. In contrast to published transfection studies, our study found that the interferon signaling pathways are only partially blocked by henipavirus infection of human cell lines.

TI  - Lethal Nipah Virus Infection Induces Rapid Overexpression of CXCL10
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is a recently emerged zoonotic Paramyxovirus that causes regular outbreaks in East Asia with mortality rate exceeding 75%. Major cellular targets of NiV infection are endothelial cells and neurons. To better understand virus-host interaction, we analyzed the transcriptome profile of NiV infection in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We further assessed some of the obtained results by in vitro and in vivo methods in a hamster model and in brain samples from NiV-infected patients. We found that NiV infection strongly induces genes involved in interferon response in endothelial cells. Among the top ten upregulated genes, we identified the chemokine CXCL10 (interferon-induced protein 10, IP-10), an important chemoattractant involved in the generation of inflammatory immune response and neurotoxicity. In NiV-infected hamsters, which develop pathology similar to what is seen in humans, expression of CXCL10 mRNA was induced in different organs with kinetics that followed NiV replication. Finally, we showed intense staining for CXCL10 in the brain of patients who succumbed to lethal NiV infection during the outbreak in Malaysia, confirming induction of this chemokine in fatal human infections. This study sheds new light on NiV pathogenesis, indicating the role of CXCL10 during the course of infection and suggests that this chemokine may serve as a potential new marker for lethal NiV encephalitis.

SP  - 1675
EP  - 84
AB  - Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are members of a new genus, Henipavirus, in the family paramyxoviridae. Each virus encodes a phosphoprotein (P) that is significantly larger than its counterparts in other known paramyxoviruses. The interaction of this unusually large P with its nucleocapsid protein (N) was investigated in this study by using recombinant full-length and truncated proteins expressed in bacteria and a modified protein-blotting protein-overlay assay. Results from our group demonstrated that the N and P of both viruses were able to form not only homologous, but also heterologous, N-P complexes, i.e. HeV N was able to interact with NiV P and vice versa. Deletion analysis of the N and P revealed that there were at least two independent N-binding sites on P and they resided at the N and C termini, respectively. Similarly, more than one P-binding site was present on N and one of these was mapped to a 29 amino acid (aa) C-terminal region, which on its own was sufficient to interact with the extreme C-terminal 165 aa region of P.

TI  - Matrix Proteins of Nipah and Hendra Viruses Interact with Beta Subunits of AP-3 Complexes
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 88
SP  - 13099
EP  - 13110
AB  - ABSTRACT Paramyxoviruses and other negative-strand RNA viruses encode matrix proteins that coordinate the virus assembly process. The matrix proteins link the viral glycoproteins and the viral ribonucleoproteins at virus assembly sites and often recruit host machinery that facilitates the budding process. Using a co-affinity purification strategy, we have identified the beta subunit of the AP-3 adapter protein complex, AP3B1, as a binding partner for the M proteins of the zoonotic paramyxoviruses Nipah virus and Hendra virus. Binding function was localized to the serine-rich and acidic Hinge domain of AP3B1, and a 29-amino-acid Hinge-derived polypeptide was sufficient for M protein binding in coimmunoprecipitation assays. Virus-like particle (VLP) production assays were used to assess the relationship between AP3B1 binding and M protein function. We found that for both Nipah virus and Hendra virus, M protein expression in the absence of any other viral proteins led to the efficient production of VLPs in transfected cells, and this VLP production was potently inhibited upon overexpression of short M-binding polypeptides derived from the Hinge region of AP3B1. Both human and bat (Pteropus alecto) AP3B1-derived polypeptides were highly effective at inhibiting the production of VLPs. VLP production was also impaired through small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of AP3B1 from cells. These findings suggest that AP-3-directed trafficking processes are important for henipavirus particle production and identify a new host protein-virus protein binding interface that could become a useful target in future efforts to develop small molecule inhibitors to combat paramyxoviral infections. IMPORTANCE Henipaviruses cause deadly infections in humans, with a mortality rate of about 40%. Hendra virus outbreaks in Australia, all involving horses and some involving transmission to humans, have been a continuing problem. Nipah virus caused a large outbreak in Malaysia in 1998, killing 109 people, and smaller outbreaks have since occurred in Bangladesh and India. In this study, we have defined, for the first time, host factors that interact with henipavirus M proteins and contribute to viral particle assembly. We have also defined a new host protein-viral protein binding interface that can potentially be targeted for the inhibition of paramyxovirus infections.

TI  - Measles and Nipah virus assembly: Specific lipid binding drives matrix polymerization
JF  - Science Advances
VL  - 8
AB  - Measles virus, Nipah virus, and multiple other paramyxoviruses cause disease outbreaks in humans and animals worldwide. The paramyxovirus matrix (M) protein mediates virion assembly and budding from host cell membranes. M is thus a key target for antivirals, but few high-resolution structures of paramyxovirus M are available, and we lack the clear understanding of how viral M proteins interact with membrane lipids to mediate viral assembly and egress that is needed to guide antiviral design. Here, we reveal that M proteins associate with phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] at the plasma membrane. Using x-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics, we demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 binding induces conformational and electrostatic changes in the M protein surface that trigger membrane deformation, matrix layer polymerization, and virion assembly.

TI  - Mechanisms and Consequences of Newcastle Disease Virus W Protein Subcellular Localization in the Nucleus or Mitochondria
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - In Newcastle disease virus (NDV), the W protein, like the V protein, is a nonstructural protein encoded by the P gene via RNA editing. Compared with the V protein, the W protein has a common N-terminal domain but a unique C-terminal domain. ABSTRACT We previously demonstrated that W proteins from different Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains localize in either the cytoplasm (e.g., NDV strain SG10) or the nucleus (e.g., NDV strain La Sota). To clarify the mechanism behind these cell localization differences, we overexpressed W protein derived from four different NDV strains or W protein associated with different cellular regions in Vero cells. This revealed that the key region for determining W protein localization is from 180 to 227 amino acids (aa). Further experiments found there is a nuclear export signal (NES) motif in the W protein at 211 to 224 aa. W protein could be transported into the nucleus via interaction with KPNA1, KPNA2, and KPNA6 in a nuclear localization signal-dependent manner, and W protein containing an NES was transported back to the cytoplasm in a chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1)-independent manner. Interestingly, we observed that the cytoplasm-localized W protein colocalizes with mitochondria. We rescued the NES-deletion W protein NDV strain rSG10-ŒîWC/WŒîNES using an NDV reverse genetics system and found that the replication ability, virulence, and pathogenicity of an NDV strain were all higher when the W protein cellular localization was in the nucleus rather than the mitochondria. Further experiments revealed that W protein nuclear localization reduced the expression of IFN-Œ≤ otherwise stimulated by NDV. Our research reveals the mechanism by which NDV W protein becomes localized to different parts of the cell and demonstrates the outcomes of nuclear or cytoplasmic localization both in vitro and in vivo, laying a foundation for subsequent functional studies of the W protein in NDV and other paramyxoviruses. IMPORTANCE In Newcastle disease virus (NDV), the W protein, like the V protein, is a nonstructural protein encoded by the P gene via RNA editing. Compared with the V protein, the W protein has a common N-terminal domain but a unique C-terminal domain. The V protein is known as a key virulence factor and an important interferon antagonist across the family Paramyxoviridae. In contrast, very little is known about the function of the NDV W protein, and this limited information is based on studies of the Nipah virus W protein. Here, we investigated the localization mechanism of NDV W protein and its subcellular distribution in mitochondria. We found that W protein localization differences impact beta interferon (IFN-Œ≤) production, consequently affecting NDV virulence, replication, and pathogenicity. This work provides new insights on the differential localization mechanism of NDV W proteins, along with fundamental knowledge for understanding the functions of W proteins in NDV and other paramyxoviruses.

TI  - Membrane Fusion Tropism and Heterotypic Functional Activities of the Nipah Virus and Hendra Virus Envelope Glycoproteins
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 76

EP  - 11198
AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are novel paramyxoviruses from pigs and horses, respectively, that are responsible for fatal zoonotic infections of humans. The unique genetic and biological characteristics of these emerging agents has led to their classification as the prototypic members of a new genus within the Paramyxovirinae subfamily called Henipavirus. These viruses are most closely related to members of the genus Morbillivirus and infect cells through a pH-independent membrane fusion event mediated by the actions of their attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. Understanding their cell biological features and exploring the functional characteristics of the NiV and HeV glycoproteins will help define important properties of these emerging viruses and may provide new insights into paramyxovirus membrane fusion mechanisms. Using a recombinant vaccinia virus system and a quantitative assay for fusion, we demonstrate NiV glycoprotein function and the same pattern of cellular tropism recently reported for HeV-mediated fusion, suggesting that NiV likely uses the same cellular receptor for infection. Fusion specificity was verified by inhibition with a specific antiserum or peptides derived from the Œ±-helical heptads of NiV or HeV F. Like that of HeV, NiV-mediated fusion also requires both F and G. Finally, interactions between the glycoproteins of the paramyxoviruses have not been well defined, but here we show that the NiV and HeV glycoproteins are capable of highly efficient heterotypic functional activity with each other. However, no heterotypic activity was observed with envelope glycoproteins of the morbilliviruses Measles virus and Canine distemper virus.

TI  - Molecular Characteristics of the Nipah Virus Glycoproteins
JF  - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
VL  - 1102
AB  - Abstract:‚ÄÇ Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus, which emerged in 1998 from fruit bats in Malaysia and caused an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in pigs and fatal encephalitis in humans with high mortality rates. In contrast to most paramyxoviruses, NiV can infect a large variety of mammalian species. Due to this broad host range, its zoonotic potential, its high pathogenicity for humans, and the lack of effective vaccines or therapeutics, NiV was classified as a biosafety level 4 pathogen. This article provides an overview of the molecular characteristics of NiV focusing on the structure, functions, and unique biological properties of the two NiV surface glycoproteins, the receptor‚Äêbinding G protein, and the fusion protein F. Since viral glycoproteins are major determinants for cell tropism and virus spread, a detailed knowledge of these proteins can help to understand the molecular basis of viral pathogenicity.

TI  - Molecular Determinants of Fibrillation in a Viral Amyloidogenic Domain from Combined Biochemical and Biophysical Studies
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 24
AB  - The Nipah and Hendra viruses (NiV and HeV) are biosafety level 4 human pathogens classified within the Henipavirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family. In both NiV and HeV, the gene encoding the Phosphoprotein (P protein), an essential polymerase cofactor, also encodes the V and W proteins. These three proteins, which share an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (NTD) and have unique C-terminal domains (CTD), are all known to counteract the host innate immune response, with V and W acting by either counteracting or inhibiting Interferon (IFN) signaling. Recently, using a combination of biophysical and structural approaches, the ability of a short region within the shared NTD (PNT3 region) to form amyloid-like structures was reported. Here, we evaluated the relevance of each of three contiguous tyrosine residues located in a previously identified amyloidogenic motif (EYYY) within HeV PNT3 to the fibrillation process. Our results indicate that removal of a single tyrosine in this motif significantly decreases the ability to form fibrils independently of position, mainly affecting the elongation phase. In addition, we show that the C-terminal half of PNT3 has an inhibitory effect on fibril formation that may act as a molecular shield and could thus be a key domain in the regulation of PNT3 fibrillation. Finally, the kinetics of fibril formation for the two PNT3 variants with highest and lowest fibrillation propensity were studied by Taylor Dispersion Analysis (TDA). The results herein presented shed light onto the molecular mechanisms involved in fibril formation. In addition, the PNT3 variants we generated represent valuable tools to further explore the functional impact of V/W fibrillation in transfected and infected cells.

TI  - Molecular assembly of measles and Nipah virus: specific lipid binding drives conformational change and matrix polymerization
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Measles virus, Nipah virus, and multiple other paramyxoviruses cause disease outbreaks in humans and animals worldwide. The paramyxovirus matrix (M) protein mediates virion assembly and budding from host cell membranes. M is thus a key target for antivirals, but few high-resolution structures of paramyxovirus M are available, and we lack the clear understanding of how viral M proteins interact with membrane lipids to mediate viral assembly and egress needed to guide antiviral design. Here, we reveal that M proteins associate with phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) at the plasma membrane. Using X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics we demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 binding induces conformational and electrostatic changes in the M protein surface that trigger membrane deformation, matrix layer polymerization, and virion assembly.

JF  - Virology
VL  - 283 2
SP  - 358
EP  - 73
AB  - Menangle virus (MenV), isolated in August 1997 following an outbreak of reproductive disease in a piggery in New South Wales, is the second previously unclassified member of the family Paramyxoviridae to be identified in Australia since 1994. Similar to Hendra virus (HeV), MenV appears to be a virus of fruit bats (flying foxes) in the genus Pteropus. No serological cross-reactivity was detected between MenV and other known paramyxoviruses and to facilitate virus classification a cDNA subtraction method was used to obtain viral-specific cDNA from MenV-infected cells. Cloning and sequencing of the products enabled the entire sequences of the NP, P/V, M, F, and HN genes to be determined. Comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences for each gene with members of the family Paramyxoviridae, determination of the P gene mRNA editing strategy, and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that MenV is a new member of the genus Rubulavirus. However the deduced protein sequence of MenV HN exhibited only limited sequence homology when compared with attachment proteins of other paramyxoviruses. Key differences within the amino acid residues considered important determinants of neuraminidase activity suggest MenV HN is unlikely to possess the same degree of neuraminidase activity characteristic of other rubulavirus and respirovirus HN proteins.

AB  - Recently, a new paramyxovirus, now known as Nipah virus (NV), emerged in Malaysia and Singapore, causing fatal encephalitis in humans and a respiratory syndrome in pigs. Initial studies had indicated that NV is antigenically and genetically related to Hendra virus (HV). We generated the sequences of the N, P/C/V, M, F, and G genes of NV and compared these sequences with those of HV and other members of the family Paramyxoviridae. The intergenic regions of NV were identical to those of HV, and the gene start and stop sequences of NV were nearly identical to those of HV. The open reading frames (ORFs) for the V and C proteins within the P gene were found in NV, but the ORF encoding a potential short basic protein found in the P gene of HV was not conserved in NV. The N, P, C, V, M, F, and G ORFs in NV have nucleotide homologies ranging from 88% to 70% and predicted amino acid homologies ranging from 92% to 67% in comparison with HV. The predicted fusion cleavage sequence of the F protein of NV had a single amino acid substitution (K to R) in comparison with HV. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that although HV and NV are closely related, they are clearly distinct from any of the established genera within the Paramyxoviridae and should be considered a new genus.

AB  - In 1998, Nipah virus (NV) emerged in peninsular Malaysia, causing fatal encephalitis in humans and a respiratory disease in swine. NV is most closely related to Hendra virus (HV), a paramyxovirus that was identified in Australia in 1994, and it has been proposed that HV and NV represent a new genus within the family Paramyxoviridae. This report describes the analysis of the sequences of the polymerase gene (L) and genomic termini of NV as well as a comparison of the full-length, genomic sequences of HV and NV. The L gene of NV is predicted to be 2244 amino acids in size and contains the six domains found within the L proteins of all nonsegmented, negative-stranded (NNS) RNA viruses. However, the GDNQ motif found in most NNS RNA viruses was replaced by GDNE in both NV and HV. The 3' and 5' termini of the NV genome are nearly identical to the genomic termini of HV and share sequence homology with the genomic termini of other members of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae. At 18,246 nucleotides, the genome of NV is 12 nucleotides longer than the genome of HV and they have the largest genomes within the family Paramyxoviridae. The comparison of the structures of the genomes of HV and NV is now complete and this information will help to establish the taxonomic position of these novel viruses within the family Paramyxoviridae.

TI  - Molecular recognition of human ephrinB2 cell surface receptor by an emergent African henipavirus
JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 112
SP  - E2156
EP  - E2165
AB  - Significance African henipaviruses (HNVs) may be responsible for the misdiagnosis of encephalitis-associated outbreaks of malaria. Host-cell infection by an African HNV relies on the initial interaction between a virally encoded surface glycoprotein and a host-cell receptor. Here, we provide a structural description of how a bat-borne Ghanaian HNV hijacks human ephrinB2 to facilitate cross-species transmission. We demonstrate that, although the Ghanian HNV is sequence dissimilar (<30% sequence identity) and displays a receptor-binding scaffold that differs significantly in structure to pathogenic HNV relatives from Asia, it adopts a nearly identical primary ephrinB2 binding mode. These data provide a molecular-level explanation for previously observed spillover of African HNVs into human populations. The discovery of African henipaviruses (HNVs) related to pathogenic Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) from Southeast Asia and Australia presents an open-ended health risk. Cell receptor use by emerging African HNVs at the stage of host-cell entry is a key parameter when considering the potential for spillover and infection of human populations. The attachment glycoprotein from a Ghanaian bat isolate (GhV-G) exhibits <30% sequence identity with Asiatic NiV-G/HeV-G. Here, through functional and structural analysis of GhV-G, we show how this African HNV targets the same human cell-surface receptor (ephrinB2) as the Asiatic HNVs. We first characterized this virus‚àíreceptor interaction crystallographically. Compared with extant HNV-G‚ÄìephrinB2 structures, there was significant structural variation in the six-bladed Œ≤-propeller scaffold of the GhV-G receptor-binding domain, but not the Greek key fold of the bound ephrinB2. Analysis revealed a surprisingly conserved mode of ephrinB2 interaction that reflects an ongoing evolutionary constraint among geographically distal and phylogenetically divergent HNVs to maintain the functionality of ephrinB2 recognition during virus‚Äìhost entry. Interestingly, unlike NiV-G/HeV-G, we could not detect binding of GhV-G to ephrinB3. Comparative structure‚Äìfunction analysis further revealed several distinguishing features of HNV-G function: a secondary ephrinB2 interaction site that contributes to more efficient ephrinB2-mediated entry in NiV-G relative to GhV-G and cognate residues at the very C terminus of GhV-G (absent in Asiatic HNV-Gs) that are vital for efficient receptor-induced fusion, but not receptor binding per se. These data provide molecular-level details for evaluating the likelihood of African HNVs to spill over into human populations.

JF  - The Journal of General Virology
VL  - 97
SP  - 1066
EP  - 1076
AB  - The amino-terminal cytoplasmic domains of paramyxovirus attachment glycoproteins include trafficking signals that influence protein processing and cell surface expression. To characterize the role of the cytoplasmic domain in protein expression, fusion support and particle assembly in more detail, we constructed chimeric Nipah virus (NiV) glycoprotein (G) and canine distemper virus (CDV) haemagglutinin (H) proteins carrying the respective heterologous cytoplasmic domain, as well as a series of mutants with progressive deletions in this domain. CDV H retained fusion function and was normally expressed on the cell surface with a heterologous cytoplasmic domain, while the expression and fusion support of NiV G was dramatically decreased when its cytoplasmic domain was replaced with that of CDV H. The cell surface expression and fusion support functions of CDV H were relatively insensitive to cytoplasmic domain deletions, while short deletions in the corresponding region of NiV G dramatically decreased both. In addition, the first 10 residues of the CDV H cytoplasmic domain strongly influence its incorporation into virus-like particles formed by the CDV matrix (M) protein, while the co-expression of NiV M with NiV G had no significant effect on incorporation of G into particles. The cytoplasmic domains of both the CDV H and NiV G proteins thus contribute differently to the virus life cycle.

TI  - Multiple Novel Functions of Henipavirus O-glycans: The First O-glycan Functions Identified in the Paramyxovirus Family
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - O-linked glycosylation is a ubiquitous protein modification in organisms belonging to several kingdoms. Both microbial and host protein glycans are used by many pathogens for host invasion and immune evasion, yet little is known about the roles of O-glycans in viral pathogenesis. Reportedly, there is no single function attributed to O-glycans for the significant paramyxovirus family. The paramyxovirus family includes many important pathogens, such as measles, mumps, parainfluenza, metapneumo- and the deadly Henipaviruses Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses. Paramyxoviral cell entry requires the coordinated actions of two viral membrane glycoproteins: the attachment (HN/H/G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. O-glycan sites in HeV G were recently identified, facilitating use of the attachment protein of this deadly paramyxovirus as a model to study O-glycan functions. We mutated the identified HeV G O-glycosylation sites and found mutants with altered cell-cell fusion, G conformation, G/F association, viral entry in a pseudotyped viral system, and, quite unexpectedly, pseudotyped viral F protein incorporation and processing phenotypes. These are all important functions of viral glycoproteins. These phenotypes were broadly conserved for equivalent NiV mutants. Thus our results identify multiple novel and pathologically important functions of paramyxoviral O-glycans, paving the way to study O-glycan functions in other paramyxoviruses and enveloped viruses.

TI  - Multiple Strategies Reveal a Bidentate Interaction between the Nipah Virus Attachment and Fusion Glycoproteins
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 10762
EP  - 10773
AB  - ABSTRACT The paramyxoviral family contains many medically important viruses, including measles virus, mumps virus, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and the deadly zoonotic henipaviruses Hendra and Nipah virus (NiV). To both enter host cells and spread from cell to cell within infected hosts, the vast majority of paramyxoviruses utilize two viral envelope glycoproteins: the attachment glycoprotein (G, H, or hemagglutinin-neuraminidase [HN]) and the fusion glycoprotein (F). Binding of G/H/HN to a host cell receptor triggers structural changes in G/H/HN that in turn trigger F to undergo a series of conformational changes that result in virus-cell (viral entry) or cell-cell (syncytium formation) membrane fusion. The actual regions of G/H/HN and F that interact during the membrane fusion process remain relatively unknown though it is generally thought that the paramyxoviral G/H/HN stalk region interacts with the F head region. Studies to determine such interactive regions have relied heavily on coimmunoprecipitation approaches, whose limitations include the use of detergents and the micelle-mediated association of proteins. Here, we developed a flow-cytometric strategy capable of detecting membrane protein-protein interactions by interchangeably using the full-length form of G and a soluble form of F, or vice versa. Using both coimmunoprecipitation and flow-cytometric strategies, we found a bidentate interaction between NiV G and F, where both the stalk and head regions of NiV G interact with F. This is a new structural-biological finding for the paramyxoviruses. Additionally, our studies disclosed regions of the NiV G and F glycoproteins dispensable for the G and F interactions. IMPORTANCE Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus that causes high mortality rates in humans, with no approved treatment or vaccine available for human use. Viral entry into host cells relies on two viral envelope glycoproteins: the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. Binding of G to the ephrinB2 or ephrinB3 cell receptors triggers conformational changes in G that in turn cause F to undergo conformational changes that result in virus-host cell membrane fusion and viral entry. It is currently unknown, however, which specific regions of G and F interact during membrane fusion. Past efforts to determine the interacting regions have relied mainly on coimmunoprecipitation, a technique with some pitfalls. We developed a flow-cytometric assay to study membrane protein-protein interactions, and using this assay we report a bidentate interaction whereby both the head and stalk regions of NiV G interact with NiV F, a new finding for the paramyxovirus family.

TI  - Mutagenesis of the nucleocapsid protein of Nipah virus involved in capsid assembly.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 90 Pt 2
SP  - 392
EP  - 7
AB  - The nucleocapsid protein of Nipah virus produced in Escherichia coli assembled into herringbone-like particles. The amino- and carboxy-termini of the N protein were shortened progressively to define the minimum contiguous sequence involved in capsid assembly. The first 29 aa residues of the N protein are dispensable for capsid formation. The 128 carboxy-terminal residues do not play a role in the assembly of the herringbone-like particles. A region with amino acid residues 30-32 plays a crucial role in the formation of the capsid particle. Deletion of any of the four conserved hydrophobic regions in the N protein impaired capsid formation. Replacement of the central conserved regions with the respective sequences from the Newcastle disease virus restored capsid formation.

TI  - Mutation of YMYL in the Nipah Virus Matrix Protein Abrogates Budding and Alters Subcellular Localization
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 12070
EP  - 12078
AB  - ABSTRACT Matrix (M) proteins reportedly direct the budding of paramyxoviruses from infected cells. In order to begin to characterize the assembly process for the highly lethal, emerging paramyxovirus Nipah virus (NiV), we have examined the budding of NiV M. We demonstrated that expression of the NiV M protein is sufficient to produce budding virus-like particles (VLPs) that are physically and morphologically similar to NiV. We identified in NiV M a sequence, YMYL, with similarity to the YPDL late domain found in the equine infectious anemia virus Gag protein. When the YMYL within NiV M was mutated, VLP release was abolished and M was relocalized to the nucleus, but the mutant M proteins retained oligomerization activity. When YMYL was fused to a late-domain mutant of the Ebola virus VP40 matrix protein, VP40 budding was restored. These results suggest that the YMYL sequence may act as a trafficking signal and a late domain for NiV M.

TI  - Mutation of domain III and domain VI in L gene conserved domain of Nipah virus
JF  - 
VL  - 1784

EP  - 
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is the etiologic agent responsible for the respiratory illness and causes fatal encephalitis in human. NiV L protein subunit is thought to be responsible for the majority of enzymatic activities involved in viral transcription and replication. The L protein which is the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase has high sequence homology among negative sense RNA viruses. In negative stranded RNA viruses, based on sequence alignment six conserved domain (domain I-IV) have been determined. Each domain is separated on variable regions that suggest the structure to consist concatenated functional domain. To directly address the roles of domains III and VI, site-directed mutations were constructed by the substitution of bases at sequences 2497, 2500, 5528 and 5532. Each mutated L gene can be used in future studies to test the ability for expression on in vitro translation.

TI  - Mutations in the G-H loop region of ephrin-B2 can enhance Nipah virus binding and infection.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 92 Pt 9
SP  - 2142
EP  - 52
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are zoonotic paramyxoviruses classified in the genus Henipavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. The entry of henipaviruses occurs through a pH-independent membrane-fusion mechanism mediated by the cooperation of the viral attachment (G) and fusion (F) envelope glycoproteins following virion binding to susceptible host cells. Virus attachment is mediated by the interaction of the G glycoprotein with ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3, which were identified as the functional receptors of henipavirus. Several residues of the G glycoprotein that are important for receptor binding have been determined through mutagenesis and structural analyses; however, similar approaches have not been carried out for the viral receptor ephrin-B2. Here, an alanine-scanning mutagenesis analysis was performed to identify residues of ephrin-B2 which are critical for NiV binding and entry by using an NiV-F- and -G-glycoprotein pseudotyped lentivirus assay. Results indicated that the G-H loop of ephrin-B2 was indeed critical for the interaction between ephrin-B2 and NiV-G. Unexpectedly, however, some alanine-substitution mutants located in the G-H loop enhanced the infectivity of the NiV pseudotypes, in particular an L124A mutation enhanced entry >30-fold. Further analysis of the L124A ephrin-B2 mutant demonstrated that an increased binding affinity of the mutant receptor with NiV-G was responsible for the enhanced infectivity of both pseudovirus and infectious virus. In addition, cell lines that were stably expressing the L124A mutant receptor were able to support NiV infection more efficiently than the wild-type molecule, potentially providing a new target-cell platform for viral isolation or virus-entry inhibitor screening and discovery.

TI  - Mutations in the Transmembrane Domain and Cytoplasmic Tail of Hendra Virus Fusion Protein Disrupt Virus-Like-Particle Assembly
AB  - ABSTRACT Hendra virus (HeV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus that causes deadly illness in horses and humans. An intriguing feature of HeV is the utilization of endosomal protease for activation of the viral fusion protein (F). Here we investigated how endosomal F trafficking affects HeV assembly. We found that the HeV matrix (M) and F proteins each induced particle release when they were expressed alone but that their coexpression led to coordinated assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) that were morphologically and physically distinct from M-only or F-only VLPs. Mutations to the F protein transmembrane domain or cytoplasmic tail that disrupted endocytic trafficking led to failure of F to function with M for VLP assembly. Wild-type F functioned normally for VLP assembly even when its cleavage was prevented with a cathepsin inhibitor, indicating that it is endocytic F trafficking that is important for VLP assembly, not proteolytic F cleavage. Under specific conditions of reduced M expression, we found that M could no longer induce significant VLP release but retained the ability to be incorporated as a passenger into F-driven VLPs, provided that the F protein was competent for endocytic trafficking. The F and M proteins were both found to traffic through Rab11-positive recycling endosomes (REs), suggesting a model in which F and M trafficking pathways converge at REs, enabling these proteins to preassemble before arriving at plasma membrane budding sites. IMPORTANCE Hendra virus and Nipah virus are zoonotic paramyxoviruses that cause lethal infections in humans. Unlike that for most paramyxoviruses, activation of the henipavirus fusion protein occurs in recycling endosomal compartments. In this study, we demonstrate that the unique endocytic trafficking pathway of Hendra virus F protein is required for proper viral assembly and particle release. These results advance our basic understanding of the henipavirus assembly process and provide a novel model for the interplay between glycoprotein trafficking and paramyxovirus assembly.

TI  - N-Glycans on Nipah Virus Fusion Protein Protect against Neutralization but Reduce Membrane Fusion and Viral Entry
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 80
SP  - 4878
EP  - 4889
AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV) is a deadly emerging paramyxovirus. The NiV attachment (NiV-G) and fusion (NiV-F) envelope glycoproteins mediate both syncytium formation and viral entry. Specific N-glycans on paramyxovirus fusion proteins are generally required for proper conformational integrity and biological function. However, removal of individual N-glycans on NiV-F had little negative effect on processing or fusogenicity and has even resulted in slightly increased fusogenicity. Here, we report that in both syncytium formation and viral entry assays, removal of multiple N-glycans on NiV-F resulted in marked increases in fusogenicity (>5-fold) but also resulted in increased sensitivity to neutralization by NiV-F-specific antisera. The mechanism underlying the hyperfusogenicity of these NiV-F N-glycan mutants is likely due to more-robust six-helix bundle formation, as these mutants showed increased fusion kinetics and were more resistant to neutralization by a fusion-inhibitory reagent based on the C-terminal heptad repeat region of NiV-F. Finally, we demonstrate that the fusogenicities of the NiV-F N-glycan mutants were inversely correlated with the relative avidities of NiV-F's interactions with NiV-G, providing support for the attachment protein ‚Äúdisplacement‚Äù model of paramyxovirus fusion. Our results indicate that N-glycans on NiV-F protect NiV from antibody neutralization, suggest that this ‚Äúshielding‚Äù role comes together with limiting cell-cell fusion and viral entry efficiencies, and point to the mechanisms underlying the hyperfusogenicity of these N-glycan mutants. These features underscore the varied roles that N-glycans on NiV-F play in the pathobiology of NiV entry but also shed light on the general mechanisms of paramyxovirus fusion with host cells.

JF  - Current pharmaceutical design
AB  - BACKGROUND
The recent Nipah virus (NiV) outbreak in India has caused a state of chaos with potential to become the next international pandemic. There is still a great deal to learn about NiV for the development of a potent treatment against it. The NiV non-structural proteins play important roles in the lifecycle of the virus, with the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) being a vital component in viral replication.


OBJECTIVES
In this study, we not only provide a comprehensive overview of all the literature concerning NiV, we also propose a model of the NiV RdRp and screened for potential inhibitors of the viral enzyme.


METHODS
Computational tools are used to design a homology model of the NiV RdRp and to identify potential inhibitors of this protein using pharmacophore-based screening.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
In this study we provide a critical guide, elucidating on the in silico requirements of the drug design and discovery process against NiV. This material lays a foundation for future research into the design and development of drugs that inhibit NiV.

TI  - New Insights into the Hendra Virus Attachment and Entry Process from Structures of the Virus G Glycoprotein and Its Complex with Ephrin-B2
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 7
AB  - Hendra virus and Nipah virus, comprising the genus Henipavirus, are recently emerged, highly pathogenic and often lethal zoonotic agents against which there are no approved therapeutics. Two surface glycoproteins, the attachment (G) and fusion (F), mediate host cell entry. The crystal structures of the Hendra G glycoprotein alone and in complex with the ephrin-B2 receptor reveal that henipavirus uses Tryptophan 122 on ephrin-B2/B3 as a ‚Äúlatch‚Äù to facilitate the G-receptor association. Structural-based mutagenesis of residues in the Hendra G glycoprotein at the receptor binding interface document their importance for viral attachments and entry, and suggest that the stability of the Hendra-G-ephrin attachment complex does not strongly correlate with the efficiency of viral entry. In addition, our data indicates that conformational rearrangements of the G glycoprotein head domain upon receptor binding may be the trigger leading to the activation of the viral F fusion glycoprotein during virus infection.

TI  - Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV)-Based Assay Demonstrates Interferon-Antagonist Activity for the NDV V Protein and the Nipah Virus V, W, and C Proteins
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 77
SP  - 1501
EP  - 1511
AB  - ABSTRACT We have generated a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that expresses the green fluorescence protein (GFP) in infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). This virus is interferon (IFN) sensitive, and pretreatment of cells with chicken alpha/beta IFN (IFN-Œ±/Œ≤) completely blocks viral GFP expression. Prior transfection of plasmid DNA induces an IFN response in CEFs and blocks NDV-GFP replication. However, transfection of known inhibitors of the IFN-Œ±/Œ≤ system, including the influenza A virus NS1 protein and the Ebola virus VP35 protein, restores NDV-GFP replication. We therefore conclude that the NDV-GFP virus could be used to screen proteins expressed from plasmids for the ability to counteract the host cell IFN response. Using this system, we show that expression of the NDV V protein or the Nipah virus V, W, or C proteins rescues NDV-GFP replication in the face of the transfection-induced IFN response. The V and W proteins of Nipah virus, a highly lethal pathogen in humans, also block activation of an IFN-inducible promoter in primate cells. Interestingly, the amino-terminal region of the Nipah virus V protein, which is identical to the amino terminus of Nipah virus W, is sufficient to exert the IFN-antagonist activity. In contrast, the anti-IFN activity of the NDV V protein appears to be located in the carboxy-terminal region of the protein, a region implicated in the IFN-antagonist activity exhibited by the V proteins of mumps virus and human parainfluenza virus type 2.

AB  - ABSTRACT Virus-cell membrane fusion is essential for enveloped virus infections. However, mechanistic viral membrane fusion studies have predominantly focused on cell-cell fusion models, largely due to the low availability of technologies capable of characterizing actual virus-cell membrane fusion. Although cell-cell fusion assays are valuable, they do not fully recapitulate all the variables of virus-cell membrane fusion. Drastic differences between viral and cellular membrane lipid and protein compositions and curvatures exist. For biosafety level 4 (BSL4) pathogens such as the deadly Nipah virus (NiV), virus-cell fusion mechanistic studies are notably cumbersome. To circumvent these limitations, we used enzymatic Nipah virus-like-particles (NiVLPs) and developed new flow virometric tools. NiV's attachment (G) and fusion (F) envelope glycoproteins mediate viral binding to the ephrinB2/ephrinB3 cell receptors and virus-cell membrane fusion, respectively. The NiV matrix protein (M) can autonomously induce NiV assembly and budding. Using a Œ≤-lactamase (Œ≤La) reporter/NiV-M chimeric protein, we produced NiVLPs expressing NiV-G and wild-type or mutant NiV-F on their surfaces. By preloading target cells with the Œ≤La fluorescent substrate CCF2-AM, we obtained viral entry kinetic curves that correlated with the NiV-F fusogenic phenotypes, validating NiVLPs as suitable viral entry kinetic tools and suggesting overall relatively slower viral entry than cell-cell fusion kinetics. Additionally, the proportions of F and G on individual NiVLPs and the extent of receptor-induced conformational changes in NiV-G were measured via flow virometry, allowing the proper interpretation of the viral entry kinetic phenotypes. The significance of these findings in the viral entry field extends beyond NiV to other paramyxoviruses and enveloped viruses. IMPORTANCE Virus-cell membrane fusion is essential for enveloped virus infections. However, mechanistic viral membrane fusion studies have predominantly focused on cell-cell fusion models, largely due to the low availability of technologies capable of characterizing actual virus-cell membrane fusion.

To circumvent these limitations, we used enzymatic Nipah virus-like-particles (NiVLPs) and developed new flow virometric tools. Our new tools allowed us the high-throughput measurement of viral entry kinetics, glycoprotein proportions on individual viral particles, and receptor-induced conformational changes in viral glycoproteins on viral surfaces. The significance of these findings extends beyond NiV to other paramyxoviruses and enveloped viruses.

TI  - Nipah Virus Attachment Glycoprotein Stalk C-Terminal Region Links Receptor Binding to Fusion Triggering
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 1838
EP  - 1850
AB  - ABSTRACT Membrane fusion is essential for paramyxovirus entry into target cells and for the cell-cell fusion (syncytia) that results from many paramyxoviral infections. The concerted efforts of two membrane-integral viral proteins, the attachment (HN, H, or G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins, mediate membrane fusion. The emergent Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic and deadly zoonotic paramyxovirus. We recently reported that upon cell receptor ephrinB2 or ephrinB3 binding, at least two conformational changes occur in the NiV-G head, followed by one in the NiV-G stalk, that subsequently result in F triggering and F execution of membrane fusion. However, the domains and residues in NiV-G that trigger F and the specific events that link receptor binding to F triggering are unknown. In the present study, we identified a NiV-G stalk C-terminal region (amino acids 159 to 163) that is important for multiple G functions, including G tetramerization, conformational integrity, G-F interactions, receptor-induced conformational changes in G, and F triggering. On the basis of these results, we propose that this NiV-G region serves as an important structural and functional linker between the NiV-G head and the rest of the stalk and is critical in propagating the F-triggering signal via specific conformational changes that open a concealed F-triggering domain(s) in the G stalk. These findings broaden our understanding of the mechanism(s) of receptor-induced paramyxovirus F triggering during viral entry and cell-cell fusion. IMPORTANCE The emergent deadly viruses Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus belong to the Henipavirus genus in the Paramyxoviridae family. NiV infections target endothelial cells and neurons and, in humans, result in 40 to 75% mortality rates. The broad tropism of the henipaviruses and the unavailability of therapeutics threaten the health of humans and livestock. Viral entry into host cells is the first step of henipavirus infections, which ultimately cause syncytium formation. After attaching to the host cell receptor, henipaviruses enter the target cell via direct viral-cell membrane fusion mediated by two membrane glycoproteins: the attachment protein (G) and the fusion protein (F). In this study, we identified and characterized a region in the NiV-G stalk C-terminal domain that links receptor binding to fusion triggering via several important glycoprotein functions. These findings advance our understanding of the membrane fusion-triggering mechanism(s) of the henipaviruses and the paramyxoviruses.

TI  - Nipah Virus C Protein Recruits Tsg101 to Promote the Efficient Release of Virus in an ESCRT-Dependent Pathway
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 12
AB  - The budding of Nipah virus, a deadly member of the Henipavirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae, has been thought to be independent of the host ESCRT pathway, which is critical for the budding of many enveloped viruses. This conclusion was based on the budding properties of the virus matrix protein in the absence of other virus components. Here, we find that the virus C protein, which was previously investigated for its role in antagonism of innate immunity, recruits the ESCRT pathway to promote efficient virus release. Inhibition of ESCRT or depletion of the ESCRT factor Tsg101 abrogates the C enhancement of matrix budding and impairs live Nipah virus release. Further, despite the low sequence homology of the C proteins of known henipaviruses, they all enhance the budding of their cognate matrix proteins, suggesting a conserved and previously unknown function for the henipavirus C proteins.

AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV) is predicted to encode four proteins from its P gene (P, V, W, and C) via mRNA editing and an alternate open reading frame. By use of specific antibodies, the expression of the V, W, and C proteins in NiV-infected cells has now been confirmed. Analysis of the P-gene transcripts shows a ratio of P:V:W mRNA of 1:1:1, but this differs over time, with greater proportions of V and W transcripts observed as the infection progresses. Eighty-two percent of transcripts are edited, with up to 11 G insertions observed. This exceptionally high editing frequency ensures expression of the V and W proteins.

TI  - Nipah Virus Efficiently Replicates in Human Smooth Muscle Cells without Cytopathic Effect
JF  - Cells
VL  - 10
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic zoonotic virus with a broad species tropism, originating in pteropid bats. Human outbreaks of NiV disease occur almost annually, often with high case-fatality rates. The specific events that lead to pathogenesis are not well defined, but the disease has both respiratory and encephalitic components, with relapsing encephalitis occurring in some cases more than a year after initial infection. Several cell types are targets of NiV, dictated by the expression of the ephrin-B2/3 ligand on the cell‚Äôs outer membrane, which interact with the NiV surface proteins. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are major targets of infection. Cytopathic effects (CPE), characterized by syncytia formation and cell death, and an ensuing vasculitis, are a major feature of the disease. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of the tunica media that line small blood vessels are infected in humans and animal models of NiV disease, although pathology or histologic changes associated with antigen-positive SMCs have not been reported. To gain an understanding of the possible contributions that SMCs might have in the development of NiV disease, we investigated the susceptibility and potential cytopathogenic changes of human SMCs to NiV infection in vitro. SMCs were permissive for NiV infection and resulted in high titers and prolonged NiV production, despite a lack of cytopathogenicity, and in the absence of detectable ephrin-B2/3. These results indicate that SMC might be important contributors to disease by producing progeny NiV during an infection, without suffering cytopathogenic consequences.

TI  - Nipah Virus Entry and Egress from Polarized Epithelial Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 87
SP  - 3143
EP  - 3154
AB  - ABSTRACT Highly pathogenic Nipah virus (NiV) infections are transmitted via airway secretions and urine, commonly via the respiratory route. Epithelial surfaces represent important replication sites in both primary and systemic infection phases. NiV entry and spread from polarized epithelial cells therefore determine virus entry and dissemination within a new host and influence virus shedding via mucosal surfaces in the respiratory and urinary tract. To date, there is no knowledge regarding the entry and exit sites of NiV in polarized epithelial cells. In this report, we show for the first time that NiV can infect polarized kidney epithelial cells (MDCK) from both cell surfaces, while virus release is primarily restricted to the apical plasma membrane. Substantial amounts of basolateral infectivity were detected only after infection with high virus doses, at time points when the integrity of the cell monolayer was largely disrupted as a result of cell-to-cell fusion. Confocal immunofluorescence analyses of envelope protein distribution at early and late infection stages suggested that apical virus budding is determined by the polarized sorting of the NiV matrix protein, M. Studies with stably M-expressing and with monensin-treated cells furthermore demonstrated that M protein transport is independent from the glycoproteins, implying that the M protein possesses an intrinsic apical targeting signal.

TI  - Nipah Virus Impairs Autocrine IFN Signaling by Sequestering STAT1 and STAT2 into Inclusion Bodies
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 15
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus that causes fatal infections in humans. As with most disease-causing viruses, the pathogenic potential of NiV is linked to its ability to block antiviral responses, e.g., by antagonizing IFN signaling through blocking STAT proteins. One of the STAT1/2-binding proteins of NiV is the phosphoprotein (P), but its functional role in IFN antagonism in a full viral context is not well defined. As NiV P is required for genome replication and specifically accumulates in cytosolic inclusion bodies (IBs) of infected cells, we hypothesized that this compartmentalization might play a role in P-mediated IFN antagonism. Supporting this notion, we show here that NiV can inhibit IFN-dependent antiviral signaling via a NiV P-dependent sequestration of STAT1 and STAT2 into viral IBs. Consequently, the phosphorylation/activation and nuclear translocation of STAT proteins in response to IFN is limited, as indicated by the lack of nuclear pSTAT in NiV-infected cells. Blocking autocrine IFN signaling by sequestering STAT proteins in IBs is a not yet described mechanism by which NiV could block antiviral gene expression and provides the first evidence that cytosolic NiV IBs may play a functional role in IFN antagonism.

TI  - Nipah Virus Infection Generates Ordered Structures in Cellulo
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 14
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus with a fatality rate of up to 92% in humans. While several pathogenic mechanisms used by NiV to counteract host immune defense responses have been described, all of the processes that take place in cells during infection are not fully characterized. Here, we describe the formation of ordered intracellular structures during NiV infection. We observed that these structures are formed specifically during NiV infection, but not with other viruses from the same Mononegavirales order (namely Ebola virus) or from other orders such as Bunyavirales (Jun√≠n virus). We also determined the kinetics of the appearance of these structures and their cellular localization at the cellular periphery. Finally, we confirmed the presence of these NiV-specific ordered structures using structured illumination microscopy (SIM), as well as their localization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). Herein, we describe a cytopathogenic mechanism that provides a new insight into NiV biology. These newly described ordered structures could provide a target for novel antiviral approaches.

TI  - Nipah Virus Infection of Immature Dendritic Cells Increases Its Transendothelial Migration Across Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells
JF  - Frontiers in Microbiology
VL  - 9
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) can infect multiple organs in humans with the central nervous system (CNS) being the most severely affected. Currently, it is not fully understood how NiV spreads throughout the body. NiV has been shown to infect certain leukocyte populations and we hypothesized that these infected cells could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), facilitating NiV entry into the CNS. Here, three leukocyte types, primary immature dendritic cells (iDC), primary monocytes (pMO), and monocytic cell line (THP-1), were evaluated for permissiveness to NiV. We found only iDC and THP-1 were permissive to NiV. Transendothelial migration of mock-infected and NiV-infected leukocytes was then evaluated using an in vitro BBB model established with human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). There was approximately a threefold increase in migration of NiV-infected iDC across endothelial monolayer when compared to mock-infected iDC. In contrast, migration rates for pMO and THP-1 did not change upon NiV infection. Across TNF-Œ±-treated endothelial monolayer, there was significant increase of almost twofold in migration of NiV-infected iDC and THP-1 over mock-infected cells. Immunofluorescence analysis showed the migrated NiV-infected leukocytes retained their ability to infect other cells. This study demonstrates for the first time that active NiV infection of iDC and THP-1 increased their transendothelial migration activity across HBMEC and activation of HBMEC by TNF-Œ± further promoted migration. The findings suggest that NiV infection of leukocytes to disseminate the virus via the ‚ÄúTrojan horse‚Äù mechanism is a viable route of entry into the CNS.

TI  - Nipah Virus Matrix Protein Influences Fusogenicity and Is Essential for Particle Infectivity and Stability
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 90
SP  - 2514
EP  - 2522
AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV) causes fatal encephalitic infections in humans. To characterize the role of the matrix (M) protein in the viral life cycle, we generated a reverse genetics system based on NiV strain Malaysia. Using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-expressing M protein-deleted NiV, we observed a slightly increased cell-cell fusion, slow replication kinetics, and significantly reduced peak titers compared to the parental virus. While increased amounts of viral proteins were found in the supernatant of cells infected with M-deleted NiV, the infectivity-to-particle ratio was more than 100-fold reduced, and the particles were less thermostable and of more irregular morphology. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the M protein is not absolutely required for the production of cell-free NiV but is necessary for proper assembly and release of stable infectious NiV particles. IMPORTANCE Henipaviruses cause a severe disease with high mortality in human patients. Therefore, these viruses can be studied only in biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories, making it more challenging to characterize their life cycle. Here we investigated the role of the Nipah virus matrix protein in virus-mediated cell-cell fusion and in the formation and release of newly produced particles. We found that even though low levels of infectious viruses are produced in the absence of the matrix protein, it is required for the release of highly infectious and stable particles. Fusogenicity of matrixless viruses was slightly enhanced, further demonstrating the critical role of this protein in different steps of Nipah virus spread.

TI  - Nipah Virus Sequesters Inactive STAT1 in the Nucleus via a P Gene-Encoded Mechanism
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 83
SP  - 7828
EP  - 7841
AB  - ABSTRACT The Nipah virus (NiV) phosphoprotein (P) gene encodes the C, P, V, and W proteins. P, V, and W, have in common an amino-terminal domain sufficient to bind STAT1, inhibiting its interferon (IFN)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. P is also essential for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase function. C is encoded by an alternate open reading frame (ORF) within the common amino-terminal domain. Mutations within residues 81 to 113 of P impaired its polymerase cofactor function, as assessed by a minireplicon assay, but these mutants retained STAT1 inhibitory function. Mutations within the residue 114 to 140 region were identified that abrogated interaction with and inhibition of STAT1 by P, V, and W without disrupting P polymerase cofactor function. Recombinant NiVs were then generated. A G121E mutation, which abrogated inhibition of STAT1, was introduced into a C protein knockout background (Cko) because the mutation would otherwise also alter the overlapping C ORF. In cell culture, relative to the wild-type virus, the Cko mutation proved attenuating but the G121E mutant virus replicated identically to the Cko virus. In cells infected with the wild-type and Cko viruses, STAT1 was nuclear despite the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. This latter observation mirrors what has been seen in cells expressing NiV W. In the G121E mutant virus-infected cells, STAT1 was not phosphorylated and was cytoplasmic in the absence of IFN stimulation but became tyrosine phosphorylated and nuclear following IFN addition. These data demonstrate that the gene for NiV P encodes functions that sequester inactive STAT1 in the nucleus, preventing its activation and suggest that the W protein is the dominant inhibitor of STAT1 in NiV-infected cells.

TI  - Nipah Virus Uses Leukocytes for Efficient Dissemination within a Host
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 85
SP  - 7863
EP  - 7871
AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV) is a recently emerged zoonotic paramyxovirus whose natural reservoirs are several species of Pteropus fruit bats. NiV provokes a widespread vasculitis often associated with severe encephalitis, with up to 75% mortality in humans. We have analyzed the pathogenesis of NiV infection, using human leukocyte cultures and the hamster animal model, which closely reproduces human NiV infection. We report that human lymphocytes and monocytes are not permissive for NiV and a low level of virus replication is detected only in dendritic cells. Interestingly, despite the absence of infection, lymphocytes could efficiently bind NiV and transfer infection to endothelial and Vero cells. This lymphocyte-mediated transinfection was inhibited after proteolytic digestion and neutralization by NiV-specific antibodies, suggesting that cells could transfer infectious virus to other permissive cells without the requirement for NiV internalization. In NiV-infected hamsters, leukocytes captured and carried NiV after intraperitoneal infection without themselves being productively infected. Such NiV-loaded mononuclear leukocytes transfer lethal NiV infection into na√Øve animals, demonstrating efficient virus transinfection in vivo. Altogether, these results reveal a remarkable capacity of NiV to hijack leukocytes as vehicles to transinfect host cells and spread the virus throughout the organism. This mode of virus transmission represents a rapid and potent method of NiV dissemination, which may contribute to its high pathogenicity.

TI  - Nipah Virus V Protein Binding Alters MDA5 Helicase Folding Dynamics
JF  - ACS Infectious Diseases
VL  - 8
SP  - 118
EP  - 128
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging and deadly zoonotic paramyxovirus that is responsible for periodic epidemics of acute respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans. Previous studies have shown that the NiV V protein antagonizes host antiviral immunity, but the molecular mechanism is incompletely understood. To address this gap, we biochemically characterized NiV V binding to the host pattern recognition receptor MDA5. We find that the C-terminal domain of NiV V (VCTD) is sufficient to bind the MDA5SF2 domain when recombinantly co-expressed in bacteria. Analysis by hydrogen‚Äìdeuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) studies revealed that NiV VCTD is conformationally dynamic, and binding to MDA5 reduces the dynamics of VCTD. Our results also suggest that the Œ≤-sheet region in between the MDA5 Hel1, Hel2, and Hel2i domains exhibits rapid HDX. Upon VCTD binding, these Œ≤-sheet and adjacent residues show significant protection. Collectively, our findings suggest that NiV V binding disrupts the helicase fold and dynamics of MDA5 to antagonize host antiviral immunity.

TI  - Nipah Virus V Protein Evades Alpha and Gamma Interferons by Preventing STAT1 and STAT2 Activation and Nuclear Accumulation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 76

EP  - 11483
AB  - ABSTRACT Characterization of recent outbreaks of fatal encephalitis in southeast Asia identified the causative agent to be a previously unrecognized enveloped negative-strand RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, Nipah virus. One feature linking Nipah virus to this family is a conserved cysteine-rich domain that is the hallmark of paramyxovirus V proteins. The V proteins of other paramyxovirus species have been linked with evasion of host cell interferon (IFN) signal transduction and subsequent antiviral responses by inducing proteasomal degradation of the IFN-responsive transcription factors, STAT1 or STAT2. Here we demonstrate that Nipah virus V protein escapes IFN by a distinct mechanism involving direct inhibition of STAT protein function. Nipah virus V protein differs from other paramyxovirus V proteins in its subcellular distribution but not in its ability to inhibit cellular IFN responses. Nipah virus V protein does not induce STAT degradation but instead inhibits IFN responses by forming high-molecular-weight complexes with both STAT1 and STAT2. We demonstrate that Nipah virus V protein accumulates in the cytoplasm by a Crm1-dependent mechanism, alters the STAT protein subcellular distribution in the steady state, and prevents IFN-stimulated STAT redistribution. Consistent with the formation of complexes, STAT protein tyrosine phosphorylation is inhibited in cells expressing the Nipah virus V protein. As a result, Nipah virus V protein efficiently prevents STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in response to IFN, inhibiting cellular responses to both IFN-Œ± and IFN-Œ≥.

TI  - Nipah Virus V and W Proteins Have a Common STAT1-Binding Domain yet Inhibit STAT1 Activation from the Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Compartments, Respectively
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 5633
EP  - 5641
AB  - ABSTRACT In previous reports it was demonstrated that the Nipah virus V and W proteins have interferon (IFN) antagonist activity due to their ability to block signaling from the IFN-Œ±/Œ≤ receptor (J. J. Rodriguez, J. P. Parisien, and C. M. Horvath, J. Virol. 76:11476-11483, 2002; M. S. Park et al., J. Virol. 77:1501-1511, 2003). The V, W, and P proteins are all encoded by the same viral gene and share an identical 407-amino-acid N-terminal region but have distinct C-terminal sequences. We now show that the P protein also has anti-IFN function, confirming that the common N-terminal domain is responsible for the antagonist activity. Truncation of this N-terminal domain revealed that amino acids 50 to 150 retain the ability to block IFN and to bind STAT1, a key component of the IFN signaling pathway. Subcellular localization studies demonstrate that the V and P proteins are predominantly cytoplasmic whereas the W protein is localized to the nucleus. In all cases, STAT1 colocalizes with the corresponding Nipah virus protein. These interactions are sufficient to inhibit STAT1 activation, as demonstrated by the lack of STAT1 phosphorylation on tyrosine 701 in IFN-stimulated cells expressing P, V, or W. Therefore, despite their common STAT1-binding domain, the Nipah virus V and P proteins act by retaining STAT1 in the cytoplasm while the W protein sequesters STAT1 in the nucleus, creating both a cytoplasmic and a nuclear block for STAT1. We also show that the IFN antagonist activity of the P protein is not as strong as that of V or W, perhaps explaining why Nipah virus has evolved to express these two edited products.

TI  - Nipah Virus-Like Particle Egress Is Modulated by Cytoskeletal and Vesicular Trafficking Pathways: a Validated Particle Proteomics Analysis
JF  - mSystems
VL  - 4
AB  - Nipah virus is a zoonotic biosafety level 4 agent with high mortality rates in humans. The genus to which Nipah virus belongs, Henipavirus, includes five officially recognized pathogens; however, over 20 species have been identified in multiple continents within the last several years. As there are still no vaccines or treatments for NiV infection, elucidating its process of viral particle production is imperative both for targeted drug design as well as for particle-based vaccine development. Developments in high-throughput technologies make proteomic analysis of isolated viral particles a highly insightful approach to understanding the life cycle of pathogens such as Nipah virus. ABSTRACT Classified as a biosafety level 4 (BSL4) select agent, Nipah virus (NiV) is a deadly henipavirus in the Paramyxoviridae family, with a nearly 75% mortality rate in humans, underscoring its global and animal health importance. Elucidating the process of viral particle production in host cells is imperative both for targeted drug design and viral particle-based vaccine development. However, little is understood concerning the functions of cellular machinery in paramyxoviral and henipaviral assembly and budding. Recent studies showed evidence for the involvement of multiple NiV proteins in viral particle formation, in contrast to the mechanisms understood for several paramyxoviruses as being reliant on the matrix (M) protein alone. Further, the levels and purposes of cellular factor incorporation into viral particles are largely unexplored for the paramyxoviruses. To better understand the involvement of cellular machinery and the major structural viral fusion (F), attachment (G), and matrix (M) proteins, we performed proteomics analyses on virus-like particles (VLPs) produced from several combinations of these NiV proteins. Our findings indicate that NiV VLPs incorporate vesicular trafficking and actin cytoskeletal factors. The involvement of these biological processes was validated by experiments indicating that the perturbation of key factors in these cellular processes substantially modulated viral particle formation. These effects were most impacted for NiV-F-modulated viral particle formation either autonomously or in combination with other NiV proteins, indicating that NiV-F budding relies heavily on these cellular processes. These findings indicate a significant involvement of the NiV fusion protein, vesicular trafficking, and actin cytoskeletal processes in efficient viral particle formation. IMPORTANCE Nipah virus is a zoonotic biosafety level 4 agent with high mortality rates in humans. The genus to which Nipah virus belongs, Henipavirus, includes five officially recognized pathogens; however, over 20 species have been identified in multiple continents within the last several years.

TI  - Nipah and Hendra Virus Glycoproteins Induce Comparable Homologous but Distinct Heterologous Fusion Phenotypes
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - The NiV and HeV henipaviruses are BSL-4 pathogens transmitted from bats. NiV and HeV often lead to human death and animal diseases. The formation of multinucleated cells (syncytia) is a hallmark of henipaviral infections and is caused by fusion of cells coordinated by interactions of the viral attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. We found via various assays that viral entry and syncytium formation depend on the viral origin of the glycoproteins, with HeV F and NiV G promoting higher membrane fusion levels than their counterparts. This is important knowledge, since both viruses use the same bat vector species and potential coinfections of these or subsequent hosts may alter the outcome of disease. ABSTRACT Nipah and Hendra viruses (NiV and HeV) exhibit high lethality in humans and are biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) paramyxoviruses in the growing genus Henipavirus. The attachment (G) and fusion (F) envelope glycoproteins are both required for viral entry into cells and for cell-cell fusion, which is pathognomonic of henipaviral infections. Here, we compared the fusogenic capacities between homologous and heterologous pairs of NiV and HeV glycoproteins. Importantly, to accurately measure their fusogenic capacities, as these depend on glycoprotein cell surface expression (CSE) levels, we inserted identical extracellular tags to both fusion (FLAG tags) or both attachment (hemagglutinin [HA] tags) glycoproteins. Importantly, these tags were placed in extracellular sites where they did not affect glycoprotein expression or function. NiV and HeV glycoproteins induced comparable levels of homologous HEK293T cell-cell fusion. Surprisingly, however, while the heterologous NiV F/HeV G (NF/HG) combination yielded a hypofusogenic phenotype, the heterologous HeV F/NiV G (HF/NG) combination yielded a hyperfusogenic phenotype. Pseudotyped viral entry levels primarily corroborated the fusogenic phenotypes of the glycoprotein pairs analyzed. Furthermore, we constructed G and F chimeras that allowed us to map the overall regions in G and F that contributed to these hyperfusogenic or hypofusogenic phenotypes. Importantly, the fusogenic phenotypes of the glycoprotein combinations negatively correlated with the avidities of F-G interactions, supporting the F/G dissociation model of henipavirus-induced membrane fusion, even in the context of heterologous glycoprotein pairs. IMPORTANCE The NiV and HeV henipaviruses are BSL-4 pathogens transmitted from bats. NiV and HeV often lead to human death and animal diseases.

TI  - Nipah and Hendra Virus Nucleoproteins Inhibit Nuclear Accumulation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 by Interfering with Their Complex Formation
AB  - ABSTRACT Henipaviruses, such as Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses, are highly pathogenic zoonotic agents within the Paramyxoviridae family. The phosphoprotein (P) gene products of the paramyxoviruses have been well characterized for their interferon (IFN) antagonist activity and their contribution to viral pathogenicity. In this study, we demonstrated that the nucleoprotein (N) of henipaviruses also prevents the host IFN signaling response. Reporter assays demonstrated that the NiV and HeV N proteins (NiV-N and HeV-N, respectively) dose-dependently suppressed both type I and type II IFN responses and that the inhibitory effect was mediated by their core domains. Additionally, NiV-N prevented the nuclear transport of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2. However, NiV-N did not associate with ImpŒ±5, ImpŒ≤1, or Ran, which are members of the nuclear transport system for STATs. Although P protein is known as a binding partner of N protein and actively retains N protein in the cytoplasm, the IFN antagonist activity of N protein was not abolished by the coexpression of P protein. This suggests that the IFN inhibition by N protein occurs in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the complex formation of STATs was hampered in the N protein-expressing cells. As a result, STAT nuclear accumulation was reduced, causing a subsequent downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) due to low promoter occupancy by STAT complexes. This novel route for preventing host IFN responses by henipavirus N proteins provides new insight into the pathogenesis of these viruses. IMPORTANCE Paramyxoviruses are well known for suppressing interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immunity with their phosphoprotein (P) gene products, and the henipaviruses also possess P, V, W, and C proteins for evading host antiviral responses. There are numerous studies providing evidence for the relationship between viral pathogenicity and antagonistic activities against IFN responses by P gene products. Meanwhile, little attention has been paid to the influence of nucleoprotein (N) on host innate immune responses. In this study, we demonstrated that both the NiV and HeV N proteins have antagonistic activity against the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by preventing the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of STAT1 and STAT2. This inhibitory effect is due to an impairment of the ability of STATs to form complexes. These results provide new insight into the involvement of N protein in viral pathogenicity via its IFN antagonism.

VL  - 78
AB  - Nipah virus infection of porcine stable kidney cells (PS), human neuronal cells (SK‚ÄêN‚ÄêMC), human lung fibroblasts cells (MRC‚Äê5), and human monocytes (THP‚Äê1) were examined. Rapid progression of cytopathic effects (CPE) and cell death were noted in PS cell cultures treated with Nipah virus, followed by MRC‚Äê5, SK‚ÄêN‚ÄêMC, and THP‚Äê1 cell cultures, in descending order of rapidity. Significant increase in the intracellular Nipah virus RNA occurred beginning at 24 hr PI in all the infected cells. Whereas, the extracellular release of Nipah virus RNA increased significantly beginning at 48 and 72 hr PI for the infected MRC‚Äê5 cells and PS cells, respectively. No significant release of extracellular Nipah virus RNA was detected from the Nipah virus‚Äêinfected SK‚ÄêN‚ÄêMC and THP‚Äê1 cells. At its peak, approximately 6.6 log PFU/¬µl of extracellular Nipah virus RNA was released from the Nipah virus‚Äêinfected PS cells, with at least a 100‚Äêfold less virus RNA was recorded in the Nipah virus‚Äêinfected SK‚ÄêN‚ÄêMC and THP‚Äê1. Approximately 15.2% (¬±0.1%) of the released virus from the infected PS cell cultures was infectious in contrast to approximately 5.5% (¬±0.7%) from the infected SK‚ÄêN‚ÄêMC cells. The findings suggest that there are no differences in the capacity to support Nipah virus replication between pigs and humans in fully susceptible PS and MRC‚Äê5 cells. However, there are differences between these cells and human neuronal cells and monocytes in the ability to support Nipah virus replication and virus release. J. Med.

TI  - Nipah virus induces two inclusion body populations: Identification of novel inclusions at the plasma membrane
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 15
AB  - Formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs) is a hallmark of infections with non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses (order Mononegavirales). We show here that Nipah virus (NiV), a bat-derived highly pathogenic member of the Paramyxoviridae family, differs from mononegaviruses of the Rhabdo-, Filo- and Pneumoviridae families by forming two types of IBs with distinct localizations, formation kinetics, and protein compositions. IBs in the perinuclear region form rapidly upon expression of the nucleocapsid proteins. These IBperi are highly mobile and associate with the aggresome marker y-tubulin. IBperi can recruit unrelated overexpressed cytosolic proteins but do not contain the viral matrix (M) protein. Additionally, NiV forms an as yet undescribed IB population at the plasma membrane (IBPM) that is y-tubulin-negative but contains the M protein. Infection studies with recombinant NiV revealed that IBPM require the M protein for their formation, and most likely represent sites of NiV assembly and budding. The identification of this novel type of plasma membrane-associated IBs not only provides new insights into NiV biology and may open new avenues to develop novel antiviral approaches to treat these highly pathogenic viruses, it also provides a basis for a more detailed characterization of IBs and their role in virus assembly and replication in infections with other Mononegavirales.

TI  - Nipah virus matrix protein: expert hacker of cellular machines
JF  - FEBS Letters
VL  - 590
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV, Henipavirus) is a highly lethal emergent zoonotic paramyxovirus responsible for repeated human outbreaks of encephalitis in South East Asia. There are no approved vaccines or treatments, thus improved understanding of NiV biology is imperative. NiV matrix protein recruits a plethora of cellular machinery to scaffold and coordinate virion budding. Intriguingly, matrix also hijacks cellular trafficking and ubiquitination pathways to facilitate transient nuclear localization. While the biological significance of matrix nuclear localization for an otherwise cytoplasmic virus remains enigmatic, the molecular details have begun to be characterized, and are conserved among matrix proteins from divergent paramyxoviruses. Matrix protein appropriation of cellular machinery will be discussed in terms of its early nuclear targeting and later role in virion assembly.

TI  - Nipah virus: a recently emergent deadly paramyxovirus.
JF  - Science
VL  - 288 5470
SP  - 1432
EP  - 5
AB  - A paramyxovirus virus termed Nipah virus has been identified as the etiologic agent of an outbreak of severe encephalitis in people with close contact exposure to pigs in Malaysia and Singapore. The outbreak was first noted in late September 1998 and by mid-June 1999, more than 265 encephalitis cases, including 105 deaths, had been reported in Malaysia, and 11 cases of encephalitis or respiratory illness with one death had been reported in Singapore. Electron microscopic, serologic, and genetic studies indicate that this virus belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and is most closely related to the recently discovered Hendra virus. We suggest that these two viruses are representative of a new genus within the family Paramyxoviridae. Like Hendra virus, Nipah virus is unusual among the paramyxoviruses in its ability to infect and cause potentially fatal disease in a number of host species, including humans.

AB  - ABSTRACT‚ÄÇ Nipah virus is a zoonotic paramyxovirus that has caused outbreaks of human disease with high fatality rates. Important differences in epidemiological features of human disease are associated with Nipah viruses isolated from Malaysia and Bangladesh, with person-to-person transmission a major pathway for infection in Bangladesh. Comparisons of Nipah virus isolates in vitro have demonstrated differences in regulation of innate immunity and replicative ability. In contrast, similarities in infection outcomes and tissue tropism in the ferret model indicate that differences between viral isolates may not be the pivotal determinants of Nipah virus transmission. Consideration and understanding of the social and cultural context within which Nipah virus outbreaks occur may be critical in the development of practical, achievable disease management strategies.

TI  - Nonstructural Nipah Virus C Protein Regulates both the Early Host Proinflammatory Response and Viral Virulence
AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic, negative-strand RNA paramyxovirus that has recently emerged from flying foxes to cause serious human disease. We have analyzed the role of the nonstructural NiV C protein in viral immunopathogenesis using recombinant virus lacking the expression of NiV C (NiVŒîC). While wild-type NiV was highly pathogenic in the hamster animal model, NiVŒîC was strongly attenuated. Replication of NiVŒîC was followed by the production of NiV-specific antibodies and associated with higher recruitment of inflammatory cells and less intensive histopathological lesions in different organs than in wild-type-NiV-infected animals. To analyze the molecular basis of NiVŒîC attenuation, we studied early changes in gene expression in infected primary human endothelial cells, a major cellular target of NiV infection. The transcriptomic approach revealed the striking difference between wild-type and mutant NiV in the expression of genes involved in immunity, with the particularly interesting differential patterns of proinflammatory cytokines. Compared to wild-type virus, NiVŒîC induced increased expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1Œ≤), IL-8, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL6, CCL20, and beta interferon. Furthermore, the expression of NiV C in stably transfected cells decreased the production of the same panel of cytokines, revealing a role of the C protein in the regulation of cytokine balance. Together, these results suggest that NiV C regulates expression of proinflammatory cytokines, therefore providing a signal responsible for the coordination of leukocyte recruitment and the chemokine-induced immune response and controlling the lethal outcome of the infection.

TI  - Novel Functions of Hendra Virus G N-Glycans and Comparisons to Nipah Virus
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 7235
EP  - 7247
AB  - ABSTRACT Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are reportedly the most deadly pathogens within the Paramyxoviridae family. These two viruses bind the cellular entry receptors ephrin B2 and/or ephrin B3 via the viral attachment glycoprotein G, and the concerted efforts of G and the viral fusion glycoprotein F result in membrane fusion. Membrane fusion is essential for viral entry into host cells and for cell-cell fusion, a hallmark of the disease pathobiology. HeV G is heavily N-glycosylated, but the functions of the N-glycans remain unknown. We disrupted eight predicted N-glycosylation sites in HeV G by conservative mutations (Asn to Gln) and found that six out of eight sites were actually glycosylated (G2 to G7); one in the stalk (G2) and five in the globular head domain (G3 to G7). We then tested the roles of individual and combined HeV G N-glycan mutants and found functions in the modulation of shielding against neutralizing antibodies, intracellular transport, G-F interactions, cell-cell fusion, and viral entry. Between the highly conserved HeV and NiV G glycoproteins, similar trends in the effects of N-glycans on protein functions were observed, with differences in the levels at which some N-glycan mutants affected such functions. While the N-glycan in the stalk domain (G2) had roles that were highly conserved between HeV and NiV G, individual N-glycans in the head affected the levels of several protein functions differently. Our findings are discussed in the context of their contributions to our understanding of HeV and NiV pathogenesis and immune responses. IMPORTANCE Viral envelope glycoproteins are important for viral pathogenicity and immune evasion. N-glycan shielding is one mechanism by which immune evasion can be achieved. In paramyxoviruses, viral attachment and membrane fusion are governed by the close interaction of the attachment proteins H/HN/G and the fusion protein F. In this study, we show that the attachment glycoprotein G of Hendra virus (HeV), a deadly paramyxovirus, is N-glycosylated at six sites (G2 to G7) and that most of these sites have important roles in viral entry, cell-cell fusion, G-F interactions, G oligomerization, and immune evasion. Overall, we found that the N-glycan in the stalk domain (G2) had roles that were very conserved between HeV G and the closely related Nipah virus G, whereas individual N-glycans in the head quantitatively modulated several protein functions differently between the two viruses.

TI  - Novel Innate Immune Functions for Galectin-1: Galectin-1 Inhibits Cell Fusion by Nipah Virus Envelope Glycoproteins and Augments Dendritic Cell Secretion of Proinflammatory Cytokines1
JF  - The Journal of Immunology
VL  - 175
SP  - 413
EP  - 420
AB  - Galectin-1 (gal-1), an endogenous lectin secreted by a variety of cell types, has pleiotropic immunomodulatory functions, including regulation of lymphocyte survival and cytokine secretion in autoimmune, transplant disease, and parasitic infection models. However, the role of gal-1 in viral infections is unknown. Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging pathogen that causes severe, often fatal, febrile encephalitis. The primary targets of NiV are endothelial cells. NiV infection of endothelial cells results in cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation triggered by the fusion (F) and attachment (G) envelope glycoproteins of NiV that bear glycan structures recognized by gal-1. In the present study, we report that NiV envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion is blocked by gal-1. This inhibition is specific to the Paramyxoviridae family because gal-1 did not inhibit fusion triggered by envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, including two retroviruses and a pox virus, but inhibited fusion triggered by envelope glycoproteins of the related Hendra virus and another paramyxovirus. The physiologic dimeric form of gal-1 is required for fusion inhibition because a monomeric gal-1 mutant had no inhibitory effect on cell fusion. gal-1 binds to specific N-glycans on NiV glycoproteins and aberrantly oligomerizes NiV-F and NiV-G, indicating a mechanism for fusion inhibition. gal-1 also increases dendritic cell production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, known to be protective in the setting of other viral diseases such as Ebola infections. Thus, gal-1 may have direct antiviral effects and may also augment the innate immune response against this emerging pathogen.

TI  - Novel Phosphoprotein-Interacting Region in Nipah Virus Nucleocapsid Protein and Its Involvement in Viral Replication
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 9793
EP  - 9799
AB  - ABSTRACT The interaction of Nipah virus (NiV) nucleocapsid (N) protein with phosphoprotein (P) during nucleocapsid assembly is the essential process in the viral life cycle, since only the encapsidated RNA genome can be used for replication. To identify the region responsible for N-P interaction, we utilized fluorescent protein tags to visualize NiV N and P proteins in live cells and analyzed their cellular localization. N protein fused to monomeric enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (N-ECFP) exhibited a dotted pattern in transfected cells, while P protein fused to monomeric red fluorescent protein (P-mRFP) showed diffuse distribution. When the two proteins were coexpressed, P-mRFP colocalized with N-ECFP dots. N-ECFP mutants with serial amino acid deletions were generated to search for the region(s) responsible for this N-P colocalization. We found that, in addition to the 467- to 496-amino-acid (aa) region reported previously, aa 135 to 146 were responsible for the N-P colocalization. The residues crucial for N-P interaction were further investigated by introducing alanine substitutions into the untagged N protein. Alanine scanning in the region of aa 135 to 146 has revealed that there are distinct regions essential for the interaction of N-P and the function of N. This is the first study to visualize Nipah viral proteins in live cells and to assess the essential domain of N protein for the interaction with P protein.

TI  - Novel Roles of the N1 Loop and N4 Alpha-Helical Region of the Nipah Virus Fusion Glycoprotein in Modulating Early and Late Steps of the Membrane Fusion Cascade
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Henipaviruses infect bats, agriculturally important animals, and humans, with high mortality rates approaching ‚àº75% in humans. Known human outbreaks have been concentrated in Southeast Asia and Australia. ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic bat henipavirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. NiV is deadly to humans, infecting host cells by direct fusion of the viral and host cell plasma membranes. This membrane fusion process is coordinated by the receptor-binding attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. Upon G-receptor binding, F fuses membranes via a cascade that sequentially involves F-triggering, fusion pore formation, and viral or genome entry into cells. Using NiV as an important paramyxoviral model, we identified two novel regions in F that modulate the membrane fusion cascade. For paramyxoviruses and other viral families with class I fusion proteins, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and HR2 regions in the fusion protein prefusion conformation bind to form a six-helix bundle in the postfusion conformation. Here, structural comparisons between the F prefusion and postfusion conformations revealed that a short loop region (N1) undergoes dramatic spatial reorganization and a short alpha helix (N4) undergoes secondary structural changes. The roles of the N1 and N4 regions during the membrane fusion cascade, however, remain unknown for henipaviruses and paramyxoviruses. By performing alanine scanning mutagenesis and various functional analyses, we report that specific residues within these regions alter various steps in the membrane fusion cascade. While the N1 region affects early F-triggering, the N4 region affects F-triggering, F thermostability, and extensive fusion pore expansion during syncytium formation, also uncovering a link between F-G interactions and F-triggering. These novel mechanistic roles expand our understanding of henipaviral and paramyxoviral F-triggering, viral entry, and cell-cell fusion (syncytia), a pathognomonic feature of paramyxoviral infections. IMPORTANCE Henipaviruses infect bats, agriculturally important animals, and humans, with high mortality rates approaching ‚àº75% in humans. Known human outbreaks have been concentrated in Southeast Asia and Australia. Furthermore, about 20 new henipaviral species have been recently discovered in bats, with geographical spans in Asia, Africa, and South America. The development of antiviral therapeutics requires a thorough understanding of the mechanism of viral entry into host cells. In this study, we discovered novel roles of two regions within the fusion protein of the deadly henipavirus NiV. Such roles were in allowing viral entry into host cells and cell-cell fusion, a pathological hallmark of this and other paramyxoviruses. These novel roles were in the previously undescribed N1 and N4 regions within the fusion protein, modulating early and late steps of these important processes of viral infection and henipaviral disease. Notably, this knowledge may apply to other henipaviruses and more broadly to other paramyxoviruses.

ABSTRACT The Paramyxoviridae family comprises important pathogens that include measles (MeV), mumps, parainfluenza, and the emerging deadly zoonotic Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV). Paramyxoviral entry into cells requires viral-cell membrane fusion, and formation of paramyxoviral pathognomonic syncytia requires cell-cell membrane fusion. Both events are coordinated by intricate interactions between the tetrameric attachment (G/H/HN) and trimeric fusion (F) glycoproteins. We report that receptor binding induces conformational changes in NiV G that expose its stalk domain, which triggers F through a cascade from prefusion to prehairpin intermediate (PHI) to postfusion conformations, executing membrane fusion. To decipher how the NiV G stalk may trigger F, we introduced cysteines along the G stalk to increase tetrameric strength and restrict stalk mobility. While most point mutants displayed near-wild-type levels of cell surface expression and receptor binding, most yielded increased NiV G oligomeric strength, and showed remarkably strong defects in syncytium formation. Furthermore, most of these mutants displayed stronger F/G interactions and significant defects in their ability to trigger F, indicating that NiV G stalk mobility is key to proper F triggering via moderate G/F interactions. Also remarkably, a mutant capable of triggering F and of fusion pore formation yielded little syncytium formation, implicating G or G/F interactions in a late step occurring post fusion pore formation, such as the extensive fusion pore expansion required for syncytium formation. This study uncovers novel mechanisms by which the G stalk and its oligomerization/mobility affect G/F interactions, the triggering of F, and a late fusion pore expansion step‚Äîexciting novel findings for paramyxoviral attachment glycoproteins. IMPORTANCE The important Paramyxoviridae family includes measles, mumps, human parainfluenza, and the emerging deadly zoonotic Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV). The deadly emerging NiV can cause neurologic and respiratory symptoms in humans with‚Äâa >60% mortality rate. NiV has two surface proteins, the receptor binding protein (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. They mediate the required membrane fusion during viral entry into host cells and during syncytium formation, a hallmark of paramyxoviral and NiV infections. We previously discovered that the G stalk domain is important for triggering F (via largely unknown mechanisms) to induce membrane fusion. Here, we uncovered new roles and mechanisms by which the G stalk and its mobility modulate the triggering of F and also unexpectedly affect a very late step in membrane fusion, namely fusion pore expansion. Importantly, these novel findings may extend to other paramyxoviruses, offering new potential targets for therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Nuclear Localization of the Nipah Virus W Protein Allows for Inhibition of both Virus- and Toll-Like Receptor 3-Triggered Signaling Pathways
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79
SP  - 6078
EP  - 6088
AB  - ABSTRACT The Nipah virus V and W proteins, which are encoded by the P gene via RNA editing, have a common N-terminal domain but unique C-terminal domains. They localize to the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, and have both been shown to function as inhibitors of JAK/STAT signaling. Here we report that V and W proteins also block virus activation of the beta interferon (IFN-Œ≤) promoter and the IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-responsive IFN-stimulated gene 54 promoter. Surprisingly, only W protein shows strong inhibition of promoter activation in response to stimulation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) by extracellular double-stranded RNA. This activity is dependent on the nuclear localization of W protein. Within the unique C-terminal domain of W protein, we have identified a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that requires basic residues at positions 439, 440, and 442. This NLS is responsible for mediating the preferential interaction of W protein with karyopherin-Œ± 3 and karyopherin-Œ± 4. Nuclear localization of W protein therefore enables it to target both virus and TLR3 pathways, whereas the cytoplasmic V protein is restricted to inhibiting the virus pathway. We propose that this discrepancy is in part due to the V protein being less able to block signaling in response to the kinase, TBK-1, whereas both V and W can prevent promoter activation in response to IKKŒµ. We demonstrate that, when the TLR3 pathway is stimulated, the levels of phosphorylated IRF3 are reduced in the presence of W protein but not V protein, confirming the differential effects of these proteins and illustrating that W protein-mediated inhibition is due to a loss of active IRF3.

TI  - Nuclear localization and secretion competence are conserved among henipavirus matrix proteins.
AB  - Viruses of the genus Henipavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae are zoonotic pathogens, which have emerged in Southeast Asia, Australia and Africa. Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus are highly virulent pathogens transmitted from bats to animals and humans, while the henipavirus Cedar virus seems to be non-pathogenic in infection studies. The full replication cycle of the Paramyxoviridae occurs in the host cell's cytoplasm, where viral assembly is orchestrated by the matrix (M) protein. Unexpectedly, the NiV-M protein traffics through the nucleus as an essential step to engage the plasma membrane in preparation for viral budding/release. Comparative studies were performed to assess whether M protein nuclear localization is a common feature of the henipaviruses, including the recently sequenced (although not yet isolated) Ghanaian bat henipavirus (Kumasi virus, GH-M74a virus) and Mojiang virus. Live-cell confocal microscopy revealed that nuclear translocation of GFP-fused M protein is conserved between henipaviruses in both human- and bat-derived cell lines. However, the efficiency of M protein nuclear localization and virus-like particle budding competency varied. Additionally, Cedar virus-, Kumasi virus- and Mojiang virus-M proteins were mutated in a bipartite nuclear localization signal, indicating that a key lysine residue is essential for nuclear import, export and induction of budding events, as previously reported for NiV-M. The results of this study suggest that the M proteins of henipaviruses may utilize a similar nucleocytoplasmic trafficking pathway as an essential step during viral replication in both humans and bats.

AB  - Summary Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus that was first isolated in 1999 during an outbreak in Malaysia. In contrast to other paramyxoviruses NiV infects many mammalian species. Because of its zoonotic potential, the high pathogenicity and the lack of therapeutic treatment, NiV was classified as a biosafety level 4 pathogen. In humans NiV causes a severe acute encephalitis whereas in some animal hosts respiratory symptoms are predominantly observed. Despite the differences in the clinical outcome, microvascular endothelial cell damage predominantly underlies the pathological changes in NiV infections in all sus-ceptible host species. NiV generally induces a pronounced vasculitis which is primarily characterised by endothelial cell necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration. For future developments of specific antiviral therapies or vaccines, a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of NiV pathogenesis is required.This article reviews the current knowledge about natural and experimental infections in different mammals, focusing on the main organ and cell tropism in vivo, and summarises some recent studies in cell culture on the role of ephrin-B2 and -B3 receptors in NiV infection of endothelial cells.

TI  - Orthoparamyxovirinae C Proteins Have a Common Origin and a Common Structural Organization
JF  - Biomolecules
VL  - 13
AB  - The protein C is a small viral protein encoded in an overlapping frame of the P gene in the subfamily Orthoparamyxovirinae. This protein, expressed by alternative translation initiation, is a virulence factor that regulates viral transcription, replication, and production of defective interfering RNA, interferes with the host-cell innate immunity systems and supports the assembly of viral particles and budding. We expressed and purified full-length and an N-terminally truncated C protein from Tupaia paramyxovirus (TupV) C protein (genus Narmovirus). We solved the crystal structure of the C-terminal part of TupV C protein at a resolution of 2.4 √Ö and found that it is structurally similar to Sendai virus C protein, suggesting that despite undetectable sequence conservation, these proteins are homologous. We characterized both truncated and full-length proteins by SEC-MALLS and SEC-SAXS and described their solution structures by ensemble models. We established a mini-replicon assay for the related Nipah virus (NiV) and showed that TupV C inhibited the expression of NiV minigenome in a concentration-dependent manner as efficiently as the NiV C protein. A previous study found that the Orthoparamyxovirinae C proteins form two clusters without detectable sequence similarity, raising the question of whether they were homologous or instead had originated independently. Since TupV C and SeV C are representatives of these two clusters, our discovery that they have a similar structure indicates that all Orthoparamyxovirine C proteins are homologous. Our results also imply that, strikingly, a STAT1-binding site is encoded by exactly the same RNA region of the P/C gene across Paramyxovirinae, but in different reading frames (P or C), depending on which cluster they belong to.

VL  - 96 10
SP  - 2961
EP  - 70
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic emerging pathogen that can cause severe and often fatal respiratory disease in humans. The pathogenesis of NiV infection of the human respiratory tract remains unknown. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by airway epithelial cells in response to viral infections contribute to lung injury by inducing inflammation and oxidative stress; however, the role of ROS in NiV-induced respiratory disease is unknown. To investigate whether NiV induces oxidative stress in human respiratory epithelial cells, we used oxidative stress markers and monitored antioxidant gene expression. We also used ROS scavengers to assess their role in immune response modulation. Oxidative stress was confirmed in infected cells and correlated with the reduction in antioxidant enzyme gene expression. Infected cells treated by ROS scavengers resulted in a significant decrease of the (F2)-8-isoprostane marker, inflammatory responses and virus replication. In conclusion, ROS are induced during NiV infection in human respiratory epithelium and contribute to the inflammatory response. Understanding how oxidative stress contributes to NiV pathogenesis is crucial for therapeutic development.

TI  - Parainfluenza virus 5 fusion protein maintains pre-fusion stability but not fusogenic activity following mutation of a transmembrane leucine/isoleucine domain.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
AB  - The paramyxoviruses Hendra virus (HeV) and parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) require the fusion (F) protein to efficiently infect cells. For fusion to occur, F undergoes dramatic, essentially irreversible conformational changes to merge the viral and cell membranes into a continuous bilayer. Recently, a transmembrane (TM) domain leucine/isoleucine (L/I) zipper was shown to be critical in maintaining the expression, stability and pre-fusion conformation of HeV F, allowing for fine-tuned timing of membrane fusion. To analyse the effect of the TM domain L/I zipper in another paramyxovirus, we created alanine mutations to the TM domain of PIV5 F, a paramyxovirus model system. Our data show that while the PIV5 F TM L/I zipper does not significantly affect total expression and only modestly affects surface expression and pre-fusion stability, it is critical for fusogenic activity. These results suggest that the roles of TM L/I zipper motifs differ among members of the family Paramyxoviridae.

AB  - The paramyxovirus family contains many common human pathogenic viruses, including measles, mumps, the parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and the zoonotic henipaviruses, Hendra and Nipah. While the expression of a type 1 fusion protein and a type 2 attachment protein is common to all paramyxoviruses, there is considerable variation in viral attachment, the activation and triggering of the fusion protein, and the process of viral entry. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of paramyxovirus F protein-mediated membrane fusion, an essential process in viral infectivity. We also review the role of the other surface glycoproteins in receptor binding and viral entry, and the implications for viral infection. Throughout, we concentrate on the commonalities and differences in fusion triggering and viral entry among the members of the family. Finally, we highlight key unanswered questions and how further studies can identify novel targets for the development of therapeutic treatments against these human pathogens.

TI  - Paramyxovirus V Proteins Interact with the RIG-I/TRIM25 Regulatory Complex and Inhibit RIG-I Signaling
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 92
AB  - ABSTRACT Paramyxovirus V proteins are known antagonists of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-mediated interferon induction pathway, interacting with and inhibiting the RLR MDA5. We report interactions between the Nipah virus V protein and both RIG-I regulatory protein TRIM25 and RIG-I. We also observed interactions between these host proteins and the V proteins of measles virus, Sendai virus, and parainfluenza virus. These interactions are mediated by the conserved C-terminal domain of the V protein, which binds to the tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) of RIG-I (the region of TRIM25 ubiquitination) and to the SPRY domain of TRIM25, which mediates TRIM25 interaction with the RIG-I CARDs. Furthermore, we show that V interaction with TRIM25 and RIG-I prevents TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I and disrupts downstream RIG-I signaling to the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. This is a novel mechanism for innate immune inhibition by paramyxovirus V proteins, distinct from other known V protein functions such as MDA5 and STAT1 antagonism. IMPORTANCE The host RIG-I signaling pathway is a key early obstacle to paramyxovirus infection, as it results in rapid induction of an antiviral response. This study shows that paramyxovirus V proteins interact with and inhibit the activation of RIG-I, thereby interrupting the antiviral signaling pathway and facilitating virus replication.

JF  - World journal of virology
VL  - 2 2
SP  - 57
EP  - 70
AB  - The paramyxoviruses are a family of > 30 viruses that variously infect humans, other mammals and fish to cause diverse outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic to lethal disease, with the zoonotic paramyxoviruses Nipah and Hendra showing up to 70% case-fatality rate in humans. The capacity to evade host immunity is central to viral infection, and paramyxoviruses have evolved multiple strategies to overcome the host interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immune response through the activity of their IFN-antagonist proteins. Although paramyxovirus IFN antagonists generally target common factors of the IFN system, including melanoma differentiation associated factor 5, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT2, and IFN regulatory factor 3, the mechanisms of antagonism show remarkable diversity between different genera and even individual members of the same genus; the reasons for this diversity, however, are not currently understood. Here, we review the IFN antagonism strategies of paramyxoviruses, highlighting mechanistic differences observed between individual species and genera. We also discuss potential sources of this diversity, including biological differences in the host and/or tissue specificity of different paramyxoviruses, and potential effects of experimental approaches that have largely relied on in vitro systems. Importantly, recent studies using recombinant virus systems and animal infection models are beginning to clarify the importance of certain mechanisms of IFN antagonism to in vivo infections, providing important indications not only of their critical importance to virulence, but also of their potential targeting for new therapeutic/vaccine approaches.

AB  - Changes to the overall glycosylation profile of viral glycoproteins have been shown to be advantageous to virus survival and virulence. Many human viral pathogens rely on specific oligosaccharides to evade detection by the host immune system. Viruses such as HIV, Hendra, SARS-CoV, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis and West Nile virus rely on N-linked and O-Linked glycosylation for critical functions such as entry into host cells, proteolytic processing and protein trafficking. Recent findings demonstrate the importance of glycosylation to viral virulence, infectivity and immune evasion in several virus families impacting on human health. This review considers the role of glycosylation in viral infection and will detail several potential therapies for these important human pathogens and emerging infections.

AB  - Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are emerging zoonotic viruses that cause severe and often lethal respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans. Henipaviruses can infect a wide range of species and human-to-human transmission has been observed for NiV. While the exact route of transmission in humans is not known, experimental infection in different animal species suggests that infection can be efficiently initiated after respiratory challenge. The limited data on histopathological changes in fatal human cases of HeV and NiV suggest that endothelial cells are an important target during the terminal stage of infection; however, it is unknown where these viruses initially establish infection and how the virus disseminates from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system and other organs. Here we review the current concepts in henipavirus pathogenesis in humans.

TI  - Phase transition and amyloid formation by a viral protein as an additional molecular mechanism of virus-induced cell toxicity
JF  - bioRxiv
AB  - Henipaviruses are severe human pathogens responsible for severe encephalitis. Their V protein is a key player in the evasion of the host innate immune response. We have previously reported a biophysical characterization of the Henipavirus V proteins and shown that they interact with DDB1, a cellular protein that is a component of the ubiquitin ligase E3 complex. Here, we serendipitously discovered that the Hendra virus V protein undergoes a liquidhydrogel phase transition. By combining experimental and bioinformatics approaches, we have identified the V region responsible for this phenomenon. This region (referred to as PNT3), which falls within the long intrinsically disordered region of V, was further investigated using a combination of biophysical and structural approaches. ThioflavinT and Congo red binding assays, together with negative-staining electron microscopy studies, show that this region forms amyloid-like, Œ≤-enriched structures. Such structures are also formed in mammal cells transfected to express PNT3. Those cells also exhibit a reduced viability in the presence of a stress agent. Interestingly, mammal cells expressing a rationally designed, non-amyloidogenic PNT3 variant (PNT33A), appear to be much less sensitive to the stress agent, thus enabling the establishment of a link between fibril formation and cell toxicity. The present findings therefore pinpoint a so far never reported possible mechanism of virus-induced cell toxicity.

TI  - Phosphorylation of paramyxovirus phosphoprotein and its role in viral gene expression.
JF  - Future microbiology
VL  - 5 1
SP  - 9
EP  - 13
AB  - Paramyxoviruses include many important human and animal pathogens such as measles virus, mumps virus, human parainfluenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as emerging viruses such as Nipah virus and Hendra virus. The paramyxovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase consists of the phosphoprotein (P) and the large protein. Both of these proteins are essential for viral RNA synthesis. The P protein is phosphorylated at multiple sites, probably by more than one host kinase. While it is thought that the phosphorylation of P is important for its role in viral RNA synthesis, the precise role of P protein phosphorylation remains an enigma. For instance, it was demonstrated that the putative CKII phosphorylation sites of the P protein of respiratory syncytial virus play a role in viral RNA synthesis using a minigenome replicon system; however, mutating these putative CKII phosphorylation sites within a viral genome had no effect on viral RNA synthesis, leading to the hypothesis that P protein phosphorylation, at least by CKII, does not play a role in viral RNA synthesis. Recently, it has been reported that the phosphorylation state of the P protein of parainfluenza virus 5, a prototypical paramyxovirus, correlates with the ability of P protein to synthesize viral RNA, indicating that P protein phosphorylation does in fact play a role in viral RNA synthesis. Furthermore, host kinases PLK1, as well as AKT1 have been found to play critical roles in paramyxovirus RNA synthesis through regulation of P protein phosphorylation status. Beyond furthering our understanding of paramyxovirus RNA replication, these recent discoveries may also result in a new paradigm in treating infections caused by these viruses, as host kinases that regulate paramyxovirus replication are investigated as potential targets of therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Polybasic KKR Motif in the Cytoplasmic Tail of Nipah Virus Fusion Protein Modulates Membrane Fusion by Inside-Out Signaling
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 4520
EP  - 4532
AB  - ABSTRACT The cytoplasmic tails of the envelope proteins from multiple viruses are known to contain determinants that affect their fusogenic capacities. Here we report that specific residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the Nipah virus fusion protein (NiV-F) modulate its fusogenic activity. Truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of NiV-F greatly inhibited cell-cell fusion. Deletion and alanine scan analysis identified a tribasic KKR motif in the membrane-adjacent region as important for modulating cell-cell fusion. The K1A mutation increased fusion 5.5-fold, while the K2A and R3A mutations decreased fusion 3- to 5-fold. These results were corroborated in a reverse-pseudotyped viral entry assay, where receptor-pseudotyped reporter virus was used to infect cells expressing wild-type or mutant NiV envelope glycoproteins. Differential monoclonal antibody binding data indicated that hyper- or hypofusogenic mutations in the KKR motif affected the ectodomain conformation of NiV-F, which in turn resulted in faster or slower six-helix bundle formation, respectively. However, we also present evidence that the hypofusogenic phenotypes of the K2A and R3A mutants were effected via distinct mechanisms. Interestingly, the K2A mutant was also markedly excluded from lipid rafts, where ‚àº20% of wild-type F and the other mutants can be found. Finally, we found a strong negative correlation between the relative fusogenic capacities of these cytoplasmic-tail mutants and the avidities of NiV-F and NiV-G interactions (P = 0.007, r2 = 0.82). In toto, our data suggest that inside-out signaling by specific residues in the cytoplasmic tail of NiV-F can modulate its fusogenicity by multiple distinct mechanisms.

TI  - Processing of Genome 5‚Ä≤ Termini as a Strategy of Negative-Strand RNA Viruses to Avoid RIG-I-Dependent Interferon Induction
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 3
AB  - Innate immunity is critically dependent on the rapid production of interferon in response to intruding viruses. The intracellular pathogen recognition receptors RIG-I and MDA5 are essential for interferon induction by viral RNAs containing 5‚Ä≤ triphosphates or double-stranded structures, respectively. Viruses with a negative-stranded RNA genome are an important group of pathogens causing emerging and re-emerging diseases. We investigated the ability of genomic RNAs from substantial representatives of this virus group to induce interferon via RIG-I or MDA5. RNAs isolated from particles of Ebola virus, Nipah virus, Lassa virus, and Rift Valley fever virus strongly activated the interferon-beta promoter. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that interferon induction depended on RIG-I, but not MDA5, and phosphatase treatment revealed a requirement for the RNA 5‚Ä≤ triphosphate group. In contrast, genomic RNAs of Hantaan virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Borna disease virus did not trigger interferon induction. Sensitivity of these RNAs to a 5‚Ä≤ monophosphate-specific exonuclease indicates that the RIG-I-activating 5‚Ä≤ triphosphate group was removed post-transcriptionally by a viral function. Consequently, RIG-I is unable to bind the RNAs of Hantaan virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Borna disease virus. These results establish RIG-I as a major intracellular recognition receptor for the genome of most negative-strand RNA viruses and define the cleavage of triphosphates at the RNA 5‚Ä≤ end as a strategy of viruses to evade the innate immune response.

TI  - Promotion of Hendra Virus Replication by MicroRNA 146a
AB  - ABSTRACT Hendra virus is a highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxovirus in the genus Henipavirus. Thirty-nine outbreaks of Hendra virus have been reported since its initial identification in Queensland, Australia, resulting in seven human infections and four fatalities. Little is known about cellular host factors impacting Hendra virus replication. In this work, we demonstrate that Hendra virus makes use of a microRNA (miRNA) designated miR-146a, an NF-Œ∫B-responsive miRNA upregulated by several innate immune ligands, to favor its replication. miR-146a is elevated in the blood of ferrets and horses infected with Hendra virus and is upregulated by Hendra virus in human cells in vitro. Blocking miR-146a reduces Hendra virus replication in vitro, suggesting a role for this miRNA in Hendra virus replication. In silico analysis of miR-146a targets identified ring finger protein (RNF)11, a member of the A20 ubiquitin editing complex that negatively regulates NF-Œ∫B activity, as a novel component of Hendra virus replication. RNA interference-mediated silencing of RNF11 promotes Hendra virus replication in vitro, suggesting that increased NF-Œ∫B activity aids Hendra virus replication. Furthermore, overexpression of the IŒ∫B superrepressor inhibits Hendra virus replication. These studies are the first to demonstrate a host miRNA response to Hendra virus infection and suggest an important role for host miRNAs in Hendra virus disease.

TI  - Purification and Characterization of Nipah Virus Nucleocapsid Protein Produced in Insect Cells
AB  - ABSTRACT The nucleocapsid (N) protein of Nipah virus (NiV) is a major constituent of the viral proteins which play a role in encapsidation, regulating the transcription and replication of the viral genome. To investigate the use of a fusion system to aid the purification of the recombinant N protein for structural studies and potential use as a diagnostic reagent, the NiV N gene was cloned into the pFastBacHT vector and the His-tagged fusion protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells by recombinant baculovirus. Western blot analysis of the recombinant fusion protein with anti-NiV antibodies produced a band of approximately 62 kDa. A time course study showed that the highest level of expression was achieved after 3 days of incubation. Electron microscopic analysis of the NiV recombinant N fusion protein purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column revealed different types of structures, including spherical, ring-like, and herringbone-like particles. The light-scattering measurements of the recombinant N protein also confirmed the polydispersity of the sample with hyrdrodynamic radii of small and large types. The optical density spectra of the purified recombinant fusion protein revealed a high A260/A280 ratio, indicating the presence of nucleic acids. Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results showed that the recombinant N protein exhibited the antigenic sites and conformation necessary for specific antigen-antibody recognition.

AB  - Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are closely related recently emerged zoonotic paramyxoviruses, belonging to Henipavirus genus. These largely unknown viruses are unique among paramyxoviruses in that they cause a severe disease in an unusually broad range of animals, as well as in humans [1]. Since the initial spillover of HeV from fruit bats of the Pteropus family to horses in Australia, and NiV from bats to pigs in Malaysia, Henipaviruses have caused almost annual outbreaks over the last two decades. Utilization of highly conserved cell surface molecules (ephrin B2 and B3) as entry receptors facilitates their transmission to various species. Henipaviruses induce severe pneumonia and encephalitis with a mortality rate in humans between 50 and 100%, making them one of the most deadly viruses known to infect humans. Multiple rounds of person-to-person transmission are observed in NiV outbreaks in Bangladesh [2], thus further extending the risk of infection in humans. Several species of fruit bats, widely distributed in Australia, Southeast Asia and Africa [3], appear to be the Henipavirus reservoir, maintaining a permanent risk of new outbreaks. Being able to cause severe zoonosis with serious health and economic problems, without efficient treatment yet available, Henipaviruses are considered as a potential agent for bioterrorism and classified as biosecurity level 4 pathogens.

TI  - Receptor-mediated cell entry of paramyxoviruses: Mechanisms, and consequences for tropism and pathogenesis
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 295
SP  - 2771
EP  - 2786
AB  - Research in the last decade has uncovered many new paramyxoviruses, airborne agents that cause epidemic diseases in animals including humans. Most paramyxoviruses enter epithelial cells of the airway using sialic acid as a receptor and cause only mild disease. However, others cross the epithelial barrier and cause more severe disease. For some of these viruses, the host receptors have been identified, and the mechanisms of cell entry have been elucidated. The tetrameric attachment proteins of paramyxoviruses have vastly different binding affinities for their cognate receptors, which they contact through different binding surfaces. Nevertheless, all input signals are converted to the same output: conformational changes that trigger refolding of trimeric fusion proteins and membrane fusion. Experiments with selectively receptor-blinded viruses inoculated into their natural hosts have provided insights into tropism, identifying the cells and tissues that support growth and revealing the mechanisms of pathogenesis. These analyses also shed light on diabolically elegant mechanisms used by morbilliviruses, including the measles virus, to promote massive amplification within the host, followed by efficient aerosolization and rapid spread through host populations. In another paradigm of receptor-facilitated severe disease, henipaviruses, including Nipah and Hendra viruses, use different members of one protein family to cause zoonoses. Specific properties of different paramyxoviruses, like neurotoxicity and immunosuppression, are now understood in the light of receptor specificity. We propose that research on the specific receptors for several newly identified members of the Paramyxoviridae family that may not bind sialic acid is needed to anticipate their zoonotic potential and to generate effective vaccines and antiviral compounds.

TI  - Regulation of Viral RNA Synthesis by the V Protein of Parainfluenza Virus 5
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 11845
EP  - 11857
AB  - ABSTRACT Paramyxoviruses include many important animal and human pathogens. The genome of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), a prototypical paramyxovirus, encodes a V protein that inhibits viral RNA synthesis. In this work, the mechanism of inhibition was investigated. Using mutational analysis and a minigenome system, we identified regions in the N and C termini of the V protein that inhibit viral RNA synthesis: one at the very N terminus of V and the second at the C terminus of V. Furthermore, we determined that residues L16 and I17 are critical for the inhibitory function of the N-terminal region of the V protein. Both regions interact with the nucleocapsid protein (NP), an essential component of the viral RNA genome complex (RNP). Mutations at L16 and I17 abolished the interaction between NP and the N-terminal domain of V. This suggests that the interaction between NP and the N-terminal domain plays a critical role in V inhibition of viral RNA synthesis by the N-terminal domain. Both the N- and C-terminal regions inhibited viral RNA replication. The C terminus inhibited viral RNA transcription, while the N-terminal domain enhanced viral RNA transcription, suggesting that the two domains affect viral RNA through different mechanisms. Interestingly, V also inhibited the synthesis of the RNA of other paramyxoviruses, such as Nipah virus (NiV), human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3), measles virus (MeV), mumps virus (MuV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This suggests that a common host factor may be involved in the replication of these paramyxoviruses. IMPORTANCE We identified two regions of the V protein that interact with NP and determined that one of these regions enhances viral RNA transcription via its interaction with NP. Our data suggest that a common host factor may be involved in the regulation of paramyxovirus replication and could be a target for broad antiviral drug development. Understanding the regulation of paramyxovirus replication will enable the rational design of vaccines and potential antiviral drugs.

TI  - Replication of a Nipah Virus Encoding a Nuclear-Retained Matrix Protein.
JF  - The Journal of infectious diseases
AB  - Nipah virus matrix protein (NiV M) plays a major role in virus assembly. It undergoes a nuclear transit before accumulating at the plasma membrane and recruiting nucleocapsids to the budding sites. Because nuclear NiV M cannot be detected in all cell types, we wondered whether it can reach the cell surface by bypassing the nucleus. Using an M mutant with a defective nuclear export signal (MNESmut), however, we revealed that the nuclear import of M is ubiquitous, because MNESmut was retained in the nuclei of all cell types tested. Because a functional nuclear transit is a general prerequisite for M surface transport, we wanted to characterize the effect of nuclear-retained M protein in a full viral context and generated a recombinant NiV-MNESmut. Mutant NiV-MNESmut caused an increased cell-cell fusion and produced lower virus titers. As expected for an assembly defective NiV, perinuclear inclusions (IBperi) were formed, but inclusions at the plasma membrane (IBPM), which probably represent the viral assembly platforms, were not found. It is interesting to note that the transport-defective MNESmut was recruited to IBperi. This probably prevents overaccumulation of nonfunctional M proteins in the cytoplasm and nuclei of NiV-infected cells and thus provides first evidence that IBperi are functionally relevant aggresome-like compartments.

TI  - Residues in the Hendra Virus Fusion Protein Transmembrane Domain Are Critical for Endocytic Recycling
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 3014
EP  - 3026
AB  - ABSTRACT Hendra virus is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus classified as a biosafety level four agent. The fusion (F) protein of Hendra virus is critical for promoting viral entry and cell-to-cell fusion. To be fusogenically active, Hendra virus F must undergo endocytic recycling and cleavage by the endosomal/lysosomal protease cathepsin L, but the route of Hendra virus F following internalization and the recycling signals involved are poorly understood. We examined the intracellular distribution of Hendra virus F following endocytosis and showed that it is primarily present in Rab5- and Rab4-positive endosomal compartments, suggesting that cathepsin L cleavage occurs in early endosomes. Hendra virus F transmembrane domain (TMD) residues S490 and Y498 were found to be important for correct Hendra virus F recycling, with the hydroxyl group of S490 and the aromatic ring of Y498 important for this process. In addition, changes in association of isolated Hendra virus F TMDs correlated with alterations to Hendra virus F recycling, suggesting that appropriate TMD interactions play an important role in endocytic trafficking.

TI  - Residues in the Stalk Domain of the Hendra Virus G Glycoprotein Modulate Conformational Changes Associated with Receptor Binding
AB  - ABSTRACT Hendra virus (HeV) is a member of the broadly tropic and highly pathogenic paramyxovirus genus Henipavirus. HeV is enveloped and infects cells by using membrane-anchored attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. G possesses an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, an external membrane-proximal stalk domain, and a C-terminal globular head that binds the recently identified receptors ephrinB2 and ephrinB3. Receptor binding is presumed to induce conformational changes in G that subsequently trigger F-mediated fusion. The stalk domains of other attachment glycoproteins appear important for oligomerization and F interaction and specificity. However, this region of G has not been functionally characterized. Here we performed a mutagenesis analysis of the HeV G stalk, targeting a series of isoleucine residues within a hydrophobic Œ±-helical domain that is well conserved across several attachment glycoproteins. Nine of 12 individual HeV G alanine substitution mutants possessed a complete defect in fusion-promotion activity yet were cell surface expressed and recognized by a panel of conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and maintained their oligomeric structure. Interestingly, these G mutations also resulted in the appearance of an additional electrophoretic species corresponding to a slightly altered glycosylated form. Analysis revealed that these G mutants appeared to adopt a receptor-bound conformation in the absence of receptor, as measured with a panel of MAbs that preferentially recognize G in a receptor-bound state. Further, this phenotype also correlated with an inability to associate with F and in triggering fusion even after receptor engagement. Together, these data suggest the stalk domain of G plays an important role in the conformational stability and receptor binding-triggered changes leading to productive fusion, such as the dissociation of G and F.

AB  - ABSTRACT Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gaseous mediator that has gained increasing recognition as an important player in modulating acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. However, its role in virus-induced lung inflammation is currently unknown. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children for which no vaccine or effective treatment is available. Using the slow-releasing H2S donor GYY4137 and propargylglycin (PAG), an inhibitor of cystathionine-Œ≥-lyase (CSE), a key enzyme that produces intracellular H2S, we found that RSV infection led to a reduced ability to generate and maintain intracellular H2S levels in airway epithelial cells (AECs). Inhibition of CSE with PAG resulted in increased viral replication and chemokine secretion. On the other hand, treatment of AECs with the H2S donor GYY4137 reduced proinflammatory mediator production and significantly reduced viral replication, even when administered several hours after viral absorption. GYY4137 also significantly reduced replication and inflammatory chemokine production induced by human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and Nipah virus (NiV), suggesting a broad inhibitory effect of H2S on paramyxovirus infections. GYY4137 treatment had no effect on RSV genome replication or viral mRNA and protein synthesis, but it inhibited syncytium formation and virus assembly/release. GYY4137 inhibition of proinflammatory gene expression occurred by modulation of the activation of the key transcription factors nuclear factor Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) at a step subsequent to their nuclear translocation. H2S antiviral and immunoregulatory properties could represent a novel treatment strategy for paramyxovirus infections. IMPORTANCE RSV is a global health concern, causing significant morbidity and economic losses as well as mortality in developing countries. After decades of intensive research, no vaccine or effective treatment, with the exception of immunoprophylaxis, is available for this infection as well as for other important respiratory mucosal viruses. This study identifies hydrogen sulfide as a novel cellular mediator that can modulate viral replication and proinflammatory gene expression, both important determinants of lung injury in respiratory viral infections, with potential for rapid translation of such findings into novel therapeutic approaches for viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 79

EP  - 7925
AB  - ABSTRACT The Hendra virus fusion (F) protein contains five potential sites for N-linked glycosylation in the ectodomain. Examination of F protein mutants with single asparagine-to-alanine mutations indicated that two sites in the F2 subunit (N67 and N99) and two sites in the F1 subunit (N414 and N464) normally undergo N-linked glycosylation. While N-linked modification at N414 is critical for protein folding and transport, F proteins lacking carbohydrates at N67, N99, or N464 remained fusogenically active. As N464 lies within heptad repeat B, these results contrast with those seen for several paramyxovirus F proteins.

TI  - Role of Sequence and Structure of the Hendra Fusion Protein Fusion Peptide in Membrane Fusion*
JF  - The Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 287
SP  - 30035
EP  - 30048
AB  - Background: A hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP) helps promote paramyxovirus F-mediated membrane fusion. Results: Efficient membrane disordering and cell-cell fusion strongly correlate with the Œ±-helical character of the Hendra F FP. Conclusion: The FP adopts an Œ±-helical structure during membrane fusion. Significance: This study represents the first in-depth characterization of a paramyxovirus FP and offers new mechanistic insights into F-mediated fusion. Viral fusion proteins are intriguing molecular machines that undergo drastic conformational changes to facilitate virus-cell membrane fusion. During fusion a hydrophobic region of the protein, termed the fusion peptide (FP), is inserted into the target host cell membrane, with subsequent conformational changes culminating in membrane merger. Class I fusion proteins contain FPs between 20 and 30 amino acids in length that are highly conserved within viral families but not between. To examine the sequence dependence of the Hendra virus (HeV) fusion (F) protein FP, the first eight amino acids were mutated first as double, then single, alanine mutants. Mutation of highly conserved glycine residues resulted in inefficient F protein expression and processing, whereas substitution of valine residues resulted in hypofusogenic F proteins despite wild-type surface expression levels. Synthetic peptides corresponding to a portion of the HeV F FP were shown to adopt an Œ±-helical secondary structure in dodecylphosphocholine micelles and small unilamellar vesicles using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Interestingly, peptides containing point mutations that promote lower levels of cell-cell fusion within the context of the whole F protein were less Œ±-helical and induced less membrane disorder in model membranes. These data represent the first extensive structure-function relationship of any paramyxovirus FP and demonstrate that the HeV F FP and potentially other paramyxovirus FPs likely require an Œ±-helical structure for efficient membrane disordering and fusion.

TI  - Roles of Cholesterol in Early and Late Steps of the Nipah Virus Membrane Fusion Cascade
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 95
AB  - Cholesterol has been implicated in various steps of the viral life cycle for different enveloped viruses. Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic enveloped virus in the Henipavirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family, capable of causing a high mortality rate in humans and high morbidity in domestic and agriculturally important animals. ABSTRACT Cholesterol has been implicated in various viral life cycle steps for different enveloped viruses, including viral entry into host cells, cell-cell fusion, and viral budding from infected cells. Enveloped viruses acquire their membranes from their host cells. Although cholesterol has been associated with the binding and entry of various enveloped viruses into cells, cholesterol‚Äôs exact function in the viral-cell membrane fusion process remains largely elusive, particularly for the paramyxoviruses. Furthermore, paramyxoviral fusion occurs at the host cell membrane and is essential for both virus entry (virus-cell fusion) and syncytium formation (cell-cell fusion), central to viral pathogenicity. Nipah virus (NiV) is a deadly member of the Paramyxoviridae family, which also includes Hendra, measles, mumps, human parainfluenza, and various veterinary viruses. The zoonotic NiV causes severe encephalitis, vasculopathy, and respiratory symptoms, leading to a high mortality rate in humans. We used NiV as a model to study the role of membrane cholesterol in paramyxoviral membrane fusion. We used a combination of methyl-beta cyclodextrin (MŒ≤CD), lovastatin, and cholesterol to deplete or enrich cell membrane cholesterol outside cytotoxic concentrations. We found that the levels of cellular membrane cholesterol directly correlated with the levels of cell-cell fusion induced. These phenotypes were paralleled using NiV/vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-pseudotyped viral infection assays. Remarkably, our mechanistic studies revealed that cholesterol reduces an early F-triggering step but enhances a late fusion pore formation step in the NiV membrane fusion cascade. Thus, our results expand our mechanistic understanding of the paramyxoviral/henipaviral entry and cell-cell fusion processes. IMPORTANCE Cholesterol has been implicated in various steps of the viral life cycle for different enveloped viruses. Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic enveloped virus in the Henipavirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family, capable of causing a high mortality rate in humans and high morbidity in domestic and agriculturally important animals. The role of cholesterol for NiV or the henipaviruses is unknown. Here, we show that the levels of cholesterol influence the levels of NiV-induced cell-cell membrane fusion during syncytium formation and virus-cell membrane fusion during viral entry. Furthermore, the specific role of cholesterol in membrane fusion is not well defined for the paramyxoviruses. We show that the levels of cholesterol affect an early F-triggering step and a late fusion pore formation step during the membrane fusion cascade. Thus, our results expand our mechanistic understanding of the viral entry and cell-cell fusion processes, which may aid the development of antivirals.

TI  - Roles of nuclear trafficking in infection by cytoplasmic negative-strand RNA viruses: paramyxoviruses and beyond.
AB  - Genome replication and virion production by most negative-sense RNA viruses (NSVs) occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm, but many NSV-expressed proteins undergo active nucleocytoplasmic trafficking via signals that exploit cellular nuclear transport pathways. Nuclear trafficking has been reported both for NSV accessory proteins (including isoforms of the rabies virus phosphoprotein, and V, W and C proteins of paramyxoviruses) and for structural proteins. Trafficking of the former is thought to enable accessory functions in viral modulation of antiviral responses including the type I IFN system, but the intranuclear roles of structural proteins such as nucleocapsid and matrix proteins, which have critical roles in extranuclear replication and viral assembly, are less clear. Nevertheless, nuclear trafficking of matrix protein has been reported to be critical for efficient production of Nipah virus and Respiratory syncytial virus, and nuclear localization of nucleocapsid protein of several morbilliviruses has been linked to mechanisms of immune evasion. Together, these data point to the nucleus as a significant host interface for viral proteins during infection by NSVs with otherwise cytoplasmic life cycles. Importantly, several lines of evidence now suggest that nuclear trafficking of these proteins may be critical to pathogenesis and thus could provide new targets for vaccine development and antiviral therapies.

TI  - Rousettus aegyptiacus Bats Do Not Support Productive Nipah Virus Replication
JF  - The Journal of Infectious Diseases
VL  - 221
SP  - S407
EP  - S413
AB  - Abstract Nipah virus (NiV) is a bat-borne zoonotic pathogen that can cause severe respiratory distress and encephalitis upon spillover into humans. NiV is capable of infecting a broad range of hosts including humans, pigs, ferrets, dogs, cats, hamsters, and at least 2 genera of bats. Little is known about the biology of NiV in the bat reservoir. In this study, we evaluate the potential for the Egyptian fruit bat (EFB), Rousettus aegyptiacus, to serve as a model organism for studying NiV in bats. Our data suggest that NiV does not efficiently replicate in EFBs in vivo. Furthermore, we show no seroconversion against NiV glycoprotein and a lack of viral replication in primary and immortalized EFB-derived cell lines. Our data show that despite using a conserved target for viral entry, NiV replication is limited in some bat species. We conclude that EFBs are not an appropriate organism to model NiV infection or transmission in bats.

AB  - The nucleoprotein (N) gene of Hendra virus (HeV), an unclassified member of subfamily Paramyxovirinae in the family Paramyxoviridae previously known as equine morbillivirus, was cloned and sequenced. The majority of the deduced amino acid sequence was further confirmed by direct sequencing of peptide fragments of the N protein derived from purified virions. The 3' untranslated sequence of the HeV N gene mRNA was 568 nt and was much longer than that observed in other Paramyxovirinae. The N protein was 532 amino acids in length with a molecular mass of 58.5 kDa. Although the HeV N protein had a slightly higher amino acid sequence identity to those of the genus Morbillivirus than to those of other Paramyxovirinae genera, the level of identity was much lower than that observed within the morbilliviruses. Our results indicated that HeV could not confidently be classified as a member of the genus Morbillivirus, Paramyxovirus or Rubulavirus and suggest that the virus be classified in a new genus within the Paramyxovirinae.

EP  - 1355
AB  - Members within the paramyxovirus subfamily Paramyxovirinae constitute a large number of highly virulent human and animal pathogens. The glycoproteins present on these viruses are responsible for mediating host cell attachment and fusion and are key targets for the design of antiviral entry inhibitors. In the present review, we discuss recent structural studies which have led to a better understanding of the various mechanisms by which different paramyxoviruses use their attachment glycoproteins to hijack specific protein and glycan cell-surface receptors to facilitate viral entry. It is observed that the paramyxovirus attachment glycoprotein consists of a conserved overall structure which includes an N-terminal six-bladed Œ≤-propeller domain which is responsible for cell receptor binding. Crystal structures of this domain from different biomedically important paramyxoviruses, including measles, Nipah, Hendra, Newcastle disease and parainfluenza viruses, alone and in complex with their functional cell-surface receptors, demonstrate three contrasting mechanisms of receptor engagement that paramyxoviruses have evolved to confer discreet protein- and glycan-receptor specificity. This structural information highlights the adaptability of the paramyxovirus attachment glycoprotein surface and the potential for the emergence of new and potentially harmful viruses in human hosts.

TI  - Side Chain Packing below the Fusion Peptide Strongly Modulates Triggering of the Hendra Virus F Protein
AB  - ABSTRACT Triggering of the Hendra virus fusion (F) protein is required to initiate the conformational changes which drive membrane fusion, but the factors which control triggering remain poorly understood. Mutation of a histidine predicted to lie near the fusion peptide to alanine greatly reduced fusion despite wild-type cell surface expression levels, while asparagine substitution resulted in a moderate restoration in fusion levels. Slowed kinetics of six-helix bundle formation, as judged by sensitivity to heptad repeat B-derived peptides, was observed for all H372 mutants. These data suggest that side chain packing beneath the fusion peptide is an important regulator of Hendra virus F triggering.

TI  - Single Amino Acid Changes in the Nipah and Hendra Virus Attachment Glycoproteins Distinguish EphrinB2 from EphrinB3 Usage
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 81
SP  - 10804
EP  - 10814
AB  - ABSTRACT The henipaviruses, Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV), are lethal emerging paramyxoviruses. EphrinB2 and ephrinB3 have been identified as receptors for henipavirus entry. NiV and HeV share similar cellular tropisms and likely use an identical receptor set, although a quantitative comparison of receptor usage by NiV and HeV has not been reported. Here we show that (i) soluble NiV attachment protein G (sNiV-G) bound to cell surface-expressed ephrinB3 with a 30-fold higher affinity than that of sHeV-G, (ii) NiV envelope pseudotyped reporter virus (NiVpp) entered ephrinB3-expressing cells much more efficiently than did HeV pseudotyped particles (HeVpp), and (iii) NiVpp but not HeVpp entry was inhibited efficiently by soluble ephrinB3. These data underscore the finding that NiV uses ephrinB3 more efficiently than does HeV. Henipavirus G chimeric protein analysis implicated residue 507 in the G ectodomain in efficient ephrinB3 usage. Curiously, alternative versions of published HeV-G sequences show variations at residue 507 that can clearly affect ephrinB3 but not ephrinB2 usage. We further defined surrounding mutations (W504A and E505A) that diminished ephrinB3-dependent binding and viral entry without compromising ephrinB2 receptor usage and another mutation (E533Q) that abrogated both ephrinB2 and -B3 usage. Our results suggest that ephrinB2 and -B3 binding determinants on henipavirus G are distinct and dissociable. Global expression analysis showed that ephrinB3, but not ephrinB2, is expressed in the brain stem. Thus, ephrinB3-mediated viral entry and pathology may underlie the severe brain stem neuronal dysfunction seen in fatal Nipah viral encephalitis. Characterizing the determinants of ephrinB2 versus -B3 usage will further our understanding of henipavirus pathogenesis.

JF  - Glycobiology
VL  - 22 4

EP  - 84
AB  - Hendra virus (HeV) continues to cause morbidity and mortality in both humans and horses with a number of sporadic outbreaks. HeV has two structural membrane glycoproteins that mediate the infection of host cells: the attachment (G) and the fusion (F) glycoproteins that are essential for receptor binding and virion-host cell membrane fusion, respectively. N-linked glycosylation of viral envelope proteins are critical post-translation modifications that have been implicated in roles of structural integrity, virus replication and evasion of the host immune response. Deciphering the glycan composition and structure on these glycoproteins may assist in the development of glycan-targeted therapeutic intervention strategies. We examined the site occupancy and glycan composition of recombinant soluble G (sG) glycoproteins expressed in two different mammalian cell systems, transient human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and vaccinia virus (VV)-HeLa cells, using a suite of biochemical and biophysical tools: electrophoresis, lectin binding and tandem mass spectrometry. The N-linked glycans of both VV and HEK293-derived sG glycoproteins carried predominantly mono- and disialylated complex-type N-glycans and a smaller population of high mannose-type glycans. All seven consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation were definitively found to be occupied in the VV-derived protein, whereas only four sites were found and characterized in the HEK293-derived protein. We also report, for the first time, the existence of O-linked glycosylation sites in both proteins. The striking characteristic of both proteins was glycan heterogeneity in both N- and O-linked sites. The structural features of G protein glycosylation were also determined by X-ray crystallography and interactions with the ephrin-B2 receptor are discussed.

TI  - Solubility, immunogenicity and physical properties of the nucleocapsid protein of Nipah virus produced in Escherichia coli
JF  - Journal of Medical Virology
VL  - 73
AB  - The nucleocapsid (N) protein of Nipah virus (NiV) can be produced in three Escherichia coli strains [TOP10, BL21(DE3) and SG935] under the control of trc promoter. However, most of the product existed in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies. There was no improvement in the solubility of the product when this protein was placed under the control of T7 promoter. However, the solubility of the N protein was significantly improved by lowering the growth temperature of E. coli BL21(DE3) cell cultures. Solubility analysis of N‚Äê and C‚Äêterminally deleted mutants revealed that the full‚Äêlength N protein has the highest solubility. The soluble N protein could be purified efficiently by sucrose gradient centrifugation and nickel affinity chromatography. Electron microscopic analysis of the purified product revealed that the N protein assembled into herringbone‚Äêlike particles of different lengths. The C‚Äêterminal end of the N protein contains the major antigenic region when probed with antisera from humans and pigs infected naturally. J. Med.

TI  - Spring-Loaded Model Revisited: Paramyxovirus Fusion Requires Engagement of a Receptor Binding Protein beyond Initial Triggering of the Fusion Protein
AB  - ABSTRACT During paramyxovirus entry into a host cell, receptor engagement by a specialized binding protein triggers conformational changes in the adjacent fusion protein (F), leading to fusion between the viral and cell membranes. According to the existing paradigm of paramyxovirus membrane fusion, the initial activation of F by the receptor binding protein sets off a spring-loaded mechanism whereby the F protein progresses independently through the subsequent steps in the fusion process, ending in membrane merger. For human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), the receptor binding protein (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase [HN]) has three functions: receptor binding, receptor cleaving, and activating F. We report that continuous receptor engagement by HN activates F to advance through the series of structural rearrangements required for fusion. In contrast to the prevailing model, the role of HN-receptor engagement in the fusion process is required beyond an initiating step, i.e., it is still required even after the insertion of the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane, enabling F to mediate membrane merger. We also report that for Nipah virus, whose receptor binding protein has no receptor-cleaving activity, the continuous stimulation of the F protein by a receptor-engaged binding protein is key for fusion. We suggest a general model for paramyxovirus fusion activation in which receptor engagement plays an active role in F activation, and the continued engagement of the receptor binding protein is essential to F protein function until the onset of membrane merger. This model has broad implications for the mechanism of paramyxovirus fusion and for strategies to prevent viral entry.

TI  - Structural Disorder within Henipavirus Nucleoprotein and Phosphoprotein: From Predictions to Experimental Assessment
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 5
AB  - Henipaviruses are newly emerged viruses within the Paramyxoviridae family. Their negative-strand RNA genome is packaged by the nucleoprotein (N) within Œ±-helical nucleocapsid that recruits the polymerase complex made of the L protein and the phosphoprotein (P). To date structural data on Henipaviruses are scarce, and their N and P proteins have never been characterized so far. Using both computational and experimental approaches we herein show that Henipaviruses N and P proteins possess large intrinsically disordered regions. By combining several disorder prediction methods, we show that the N-terminal domain of P (PNT) and the C-terminal domain of N (NTAIL) are both mostly disordered, although they contain short order-prone segments. We then report the cloning, the bacterial expression, purification and characterization of Henipavirus PNT and NTAIL domains. By combining gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance, we show that both NTAIL and PNT belong to the premolten globule sub-family within the class of intrinsically disordered proteins. This study is the first reported experimental characterization of Henipavirus P and N proteins. The evidence that their respective N-terminal and C-terminal domains are highly disordered under native conditions is expected to be invaluable for future structural studies by helping to delineate N and P protein domains amenable to crystallization. In addition, following previous hints establishing a relationship between structural disorder and protein interactivity, the present results suggest that Henipavirus PNT and NTAIL domains could be involved in manifold protein-protein interactions.

EP  - 15726
AB  - We herein review available computational and experimental data pointing to the abundance of structural disorder within the nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) from three paramyxoviruses, namely the measles (MeV), Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses. We provide a detailed molecular description of the mechanisms governing the disorder-to-order transition that the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (NTAIL) of their N proteins undergoes upon binding to the C-terminal X domain (PXD) of the homologous P proteins. We also show that NTAIL‚ÄìPXD complexes are ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù, i.e., they possess a significant residual disorder, and discuss the possible functional significance of this fuzziness. Finally, we emphasize the relevance of N‚ÄìP interactions involving intrinsically disordered proteins as promising targets for new antiviral approaches, and end up summarizing the general functional advantages of disorder for viruses.

TI  - Structural Insight into Paramyxovirus and Pneumovirus Entry Inhibition
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 12
AB  - Paramyxoviruses and pneumoviruses infect cells through fusion (F) protein-mediated merger of the viral envelope with target membranes. Members of these families include a range of major human and animal pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus (MeV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), and highly pathogenic Nipah virus (NiV). High-resolution F protein structures in both the metastable pre- and the postfusion conformation have been solved for several members of the families and a number of F-targeting entry inhibitors have progressed to advanced development or clinical testing. However, small-molecule RSV entry inhibitors have overall disappointed in clinical trials and viral resistance developed rapidly in experimental settings and patients, raising the question of whether the available structural information may provide a path to counteract viral escape through proactive inhibitor engineering. This article will summarize current mechanistic insight into F-mediated membrane fusion and examine the contribution of structural information to the development of small-molecule F inhibitors. Implications are outlined for future drug target selection and rational drug engineering strategies.

JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

EP  - 20715
AB  - Significance Nipah and Hendra viruses are pathogenic zoonotic henipaviruses, transmitted from wildlife to humans, and potential epidemic threats. Zoonoses from wildlife hosts to humans require overcoming barriers that limit cross-species transmission. Successful usage of virus entry receptors represents a bottleneck to zoonosis. Conserved ephrins are recognized entry receptors for henipaviruses like Nipah virus. Here, we characterize the ephrin entry receptor usage of Cedar virus (CedV), a related henipavirus with unknown zoonotic potential that is nonpathogenic in animals known to be susceptible to Nipah and Hendra disease. We discovered that CedV utilizes 4 different ephrins, 3 of which are unique receptors for CedV, and determined that a single natural amino acid difference between human and mouse ephrin-A1 can dictate functional receptor usage.

JF  - Molecular bioSystems
VL  - 8 1
SP  - 69
EP  - 81
AB  - This review focuses on the experimental data showing the abundance of structural disorder within the nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) from three paramyxoviruses, namely Nipah (NiV), Hendra (HeV) and measles (MeV) viruses. We provide a detailed description of the molecular mechanisms governing the disorder-to-order transition of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domains (N(TAIL)) of their N proteins upon binding to the C-terminal X domain (XD) of the homologous P proteins. We also show that a significant flexibility persists within N(TAIL)-XD complexes, which therefore provide illustrative examples of "fuzziness". The functional implications of structural disorder are discussed in light of the ability of disordered regions to establish a complex molecular partnership, thereby leading to a variety of biological effects. Taking into account the promiscuity that typifies disordered regions, we propose that the main functional advantage of the abundance of disorder within viruses would reside in pleiotropy and genetic compaction, where a single gene would encode a single (regulatory) protein product able to establish multiple interactions via its disordered regions, and hence to exert multiple concomitant biological effects.

JF  - 
VL  - 2015
AB  - Nipah virus is an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus that is responsible for severe outbreaks in humans and livestocks. This negative stranded RNA virus carries RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex which is required for viral RNA replication and transcription as a catalytic subunit of viral replicase. We have investigated the 3D structures of four domains from three proteins- Nucleocapsid (N), Phosphoprotein (P) and Polymerase (L) which contribute to form RdRp complex. The presence of intrinsic disorder regions in those proteins under native condition which made the in vitro study of structure difficult. In our study, the 3D homology models of the domain Alpha MoRE and PXD (forming N-P complex), and domain PMD and Domain I (forming P-L complex) were generated and evaluated. Protein-protein docking studies of these four domains was performed which elucidated the structural aspects of RdRp complex and also showed the nature of individual interaction (N-P and P-L). The evidence of the weak binding of Alpha MoRE with PXD than the binding affinity of PMD to Domain I have suggested that, the Alpha MoRE-PXD interaction as a valuable drug target.

JF  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
VL  - 113
SP  - 1056
EP  - 1061
AB  - Significance Hendra virus (HeV) is a deadly member of the Henipavirus genus of paramyxoviruses, which causes high mortality in humans and horses. We determined the crystal structure of the HeV fusion protein, F, in its metastable, prefusion conformation. The structure is highly conserved compared with parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) F, but divergent from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F. The structural similarities suggest a common mode of activation for PIV5 and HeV F despite low sequence homology. Structural differences in the HeV F cleavage/activation loop are observed that may be explained by a requirement for cleavage by cathepsins. The HeV F structure was used to predict disulfide bonds that stabilize its prefusion conformation, providing a construct for vaccine and functional studies. Hendra virus (HeV) is one of the two prototypical members of the Henipavirus genus of paramyxoviruses, which are designated biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) organisms due to the high mortality rate of Nipah virus (NiV) and HeV in humans. Paramyxovirus cell entry is mediated by the fusion protein, F, in response to binding of a host receptor by the attachment protein. During posttranslational processing, the fusion peptide of F is released and, upon receptor-induced triggering, inserts into the host cell membrane. As F undergoes a dramatic refolding from its prefusion to postfusion conformation, the fusion peptide brings the host and viral membranes together, allowing entry of the viral RNA. Here, we present the crystal structure of the prefusion form of the HeV F ectodomain. The structure shows very high similarity to the structure of prefusion parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) F, with the main structural differences in the membrane distal apical loops and the fusion peptide cleavage loop. Functional assays of mutants show that the apical loop can tolerate perturbation in length and surface residues without loss of function, except for residues involved in the stability and conservation of the F protein fold. Structure-based disulfide mutants were designed to anchor the fusion peptide to conformationally invariant residues of the F head. Two mutants were identified that inhibit F-mediated fusion by stabilizing F in its prefusion conformation.

TI  - Structures of Langya Virus Fusion Protein Ectodomain in Pre- and Postfusion Conformation
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 97
AB  - The Henipavirus genus is quickly expanding into new animal hosts and geographic locations. This study compares the structure and antigenicity of the Langya virus fusion protein to other henipaviruses, which have important vaccine and therapeutic development implications. Furthermore, the study proposes a new mechanism to explain the early steps of the fusion initiation process that can be more broadly applied to the Paramyxoviridae family. ABSTRACT Langya virus (LayV) is a paramyxovirus in the Henipavirus genus, closely related to the deadly Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses, that was identified in August 2022 through disease surveillance following animal exposure in eastern China. Paramyxoviruses present two glycoproteins on their surface, known as attachment and fusion proteins, that mediate entry into cells and constitute the primary antigenic targets for immune response. Here, we determine cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the uncleaved LayV fusion protein (F) ectodomain in pre- and postfusion conformations. The LayV-F protein exhibits pre- and postfusion architectures that, despite being highly conserved across paramyxoviruses, show differences in their surface properties, in particular at the apex of the prefusion trimer, that may contribute to antigenic variability. While dramatic conformational changes were visualized between the pre- and postfusion forms of the LayV-F protein, several domains remained invariant, held together by highly conserved disulfides. The LayV-F fusion peptide (FP) is buried within a highly conserved, hydrophobic interprotomer pocket in the prefusion state and is notably less flexible than the rest of the protein, highlighting its ‚Äúspring-loaded‚Äù state and suggesting that the mechanism of pre-to-post transition must involve perturbations to the pocket and release of the fusion peptide. Together, these results offer a structural basis for how the Langya virus fusion protein compares to its Henipavirus relatives and propose a mechanism for the initial step of pre- to postfusion conversion that may apply more broadly to paramyxoviruses. IMPORTANCE The Henipavirus genus is quickly expanding into new animal hosts and geographic locations. This study compares the structure and antigenicity of the Langya virus fusion protein to other henipaviruses, which have important vaccine and therapeutic development implications. Furthermore, the study proposes a new mechanism to explain the early steps of the fusion initiation process that can be more broadly applied to the Paramyxoviridae family.

TI  - Sub-nucleolar trafficking of Hendra virus matrix protein is regulated by ubiquitination and oligomerisation
AB  - Hendra virus (HeV) is a highly pathogenic member of the Henipavirus genus (order Mononegavirales), the replication cycle of which occurs primarily in the cytoplasm. The HeV matrix protein (HeV M) plays critical roles in viral assembly and budding at the plasma membrane, but also undergoes nuclear/nucleolar trafficking, to accumulate in nucleoli early in infection and, later, localise predominantly at the plasma membrane. Previously we found that HeV M protein targets specific sub-nucleolar compartments (corresponding to the FC-DFC (fibrillar centre (FC)/dense fibrillar component (DFC)) where it interacts with the nucleolar protein Treacle and modulates rRNA biogenesis by subverting the host nucleolar DNA damage response, indicating the importance of specific sub-nucleolar trafficking to infection. However, the mechanisms underlying targeting and movement between sub-nucleolar compartments by viral or cellular proteins remain poorly defined. Here, we assessed the molecular regulation of HeV M protein nucleolar/sub-nucleolar trafficking, finding that HeV M localizes into Treacle-enriched FC-DFC early after expression, but this localization is progressively depleted through relocalization to the surrounding granular component (GC) of the nucleolus. Analysis using mutated M proteins and pharmacological modulation of ubiquitination indicate that this dynamic localization is regulated by ubiquitination and oligomerisation, with ubiquitination required for retention of HeV M in Treacle-enriched sub-nucleolar compartments, and oligomerisation required for egress. To our knowledge, this study provides the first direct insights into the dynamics and mechanisms of viral protein trafficking between sub-nucleolar compartment, shedding light on the intricate interplay between HeV M and host cell factors during infection.

TI  - Subcellular Localization and Calcium and pH Requirements for Proteolytic Processing of the Hendra Virus Fusion Protein
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 9154
EP  - 9163
AB  - ABSTRACT Proteolytic cleavage of the Hendra virus fusion (F) protein results in the formation of disulfide-linked F1 and F2 subunits, with cleavage occurring after residue K109 in the sequence GDVK‚ÜìL. This unusual cleavage site and efficient propagation of Hendra virus in a furin-deficient cell line indicate that the Hendra F protein is not cleaved by furin, the protease responsible for proteolytic activation of many viral fusion proteins. To identify the subcellular site of Hendra F processing, Vero cells transfected with pCAGGS-Hendra F or pCAGGS-SV5 F were metabolically labeled and chased in the absence and presence of inhibitors of exocytosis. The addition of carbonyl-cyanide-3-chlorophenylhydrazone, monensin, brefeldin A, or NaF-AlCl3 or incubation of cells at 20¬∞C all inhibited processing of the Hendra F protein, suggesting that cleavage of Hendra F occurs either in secretory vesicles budding from the trans-Golgi network or at the cell surface. In contrast to proteolytic cleavage of the simian virus 5 (SV5) F protein by the Ca2+-dependent protease furin, proteolytic cleavage of the Hendra F protein was not significantly inhibited by decreases in Ca2+ levels following incubation with EGTA or A23187. However, in the presence of weak amines and H+ V-ATPase inhibitors, known to raise intracellular pH, cleavage of Hendra F protein was inhibited while processing of the SV5 F protein was not significantly affected. The subcellular location, sensitivity to pH changes, and decreased Ca2+ requirement suggest that the protease responsible for cleavage of Hendra F protein differs from proteases previously shown to be involved in the processing of other viral glycoproteins.

TI  - Subnanometer structure of an enveloped virus fusion complex on viral surface reveals new entry mechanisms
JF  - Science Advances
VL  - 9
AB  - Paramyxoviruses‚Äîincluding important pathogens like parainfluenza, measles, and Nipah viruses‚Äîuse a receptor binding protein [hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) for parainfluenza] and a fusion protein (F), acting in a complex, to enter cells. We use cryo‚Äìelectron tomography to visualize the fusion complex of human parainfluenza virus 3 (HN/F) on the surface of authentic clinical viruses at a subnanometer resolution sufficient to answer mechanistic questions. An HN loop inserts in a pocket on F, showing how the fusion complex remains in a ready but quiescent state until activation. The globular HN heads are rotated with respect to each other: one downward to contact F, and the other upward to grapple cellular receptors, demonstrating how HN/F performs distinct steps before F activation. This depiction of viral fusion illuminates potentially druggable targets for paramyxoviruses and sheds light on fusion processes that underpin wide-ranging biological processes but have not been visualized in situ or at the present resolution.

AB  - ABSTRACT Serological screening and detection of genomic RNA indicates that members of the genus Henipavirus are present not only in Southeast Asia but also in African fruit bats. We demonstrate that the surface glycoproteins F and G of an African henipavirus (M74) induce syncytium formation in a kidney cell line derived from an African fruit bat, Hypsignathus monstrosus. Despite a less broad cell tropism, the M74 glycoproteins show functional similarities to glycoproteins of Nipah virus.

TI  - Tetherin Inhibits Nipah Virus but Not Ebola Virus Replication in Fruit Bat Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - Ebola virus and Nipah virus (EBOV and NiV) can cause fatal disease in humans. In contrast, infected fruit bats do not develop symptoms but can transmit the virus to humans. Why fruit bats but not humans control infection is largely unknown. Tetherin is an antiviral host cell protein and is counteracted by the EBOV glycoprotein in human cells. Here, employing model systems, we show that tetherin of fruit bats displays higher antiviral activity than human tetherin and is largely resistant against counteraction by the Ebola virus glycoprotein. Moreover, we demonstrate that induction of tetherin expression is critical for interferon-mediated inhibition of NiV but, for at present unknown reasons, not EBOV spread in fruit bat cells. Collectively, our findings identify tetherin as an antiviral effector of innate immune responses in fruit bats, which might allow these animals to control infection with NiV and potentially other viruses that cause severe disease in humans. ABSTRACT Ebola virus (EBOV) and Nipah virus (NiV) infection of humans can cause fatal disease and constitutes a public health threat. In contrast, EBOV and NiV infection of fruit bats, the putative (EBOV) or proven (NiV) natural reservoir, is not associated with disease, and it is currently unknown how these animals control the virus. The human interferon (IFN)-stimulated antiviral effector protein tetherin (CD317, BST-2) blocks release of EBOV- and NiV-like particles from cells and is counteracted by the EBOV glycoprotein (GP). In contrast, it is unknown whether fruit bat tetherin restricts virus infection and is susceptible to GP-driven antagonism. Here, we report the sequence of fruit bat tetherin and show that its expression is IFN stimulated and associated with strong antiviral activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that EBOV-GP antagonizes tetherin orthologues of diverse species but fails to efficiently counteract fruit bat tetherin in virus-like particle (VLP) release assays. However, unexpectedly, tetherin was dispensable for robust IFN-mediated inhibition of EBOV spread in fruit bat cells. Thus, the VLP-based model systems mimicking tetherin-mediated inhibition of EBOV release and its counteraction by GP seem not to adequately reflect all aspects of EBOV release from IFN-stimulated fruit bat cells, potentially due to differences in tetherin expression levels that could not be resolved by the present study. In contrast, tetherin expression was essential for IFN-dependent inhibition of NiV infection, demonstrating that IFN-induced fruit bat tetherin exerts antiviral activity and may critically contribute to control of NiV and potentially other highly virulent viruses in infected animals. IMPORTANCE Ebola virus and Nipah virus (EBOV and NiV) can cause fatal disease in humans. In contrast, infected fruit bats do not develop symptoms but can transmit the virus to humans.

TI  - The C, V and W proteins of Nipah virus inhibit minigenome replication.
JF  - The Journal of general virology
VL  - 89 Pt 5
SP  - 1300
EP  - 8
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is a recently emergent, highly pathogenic, zoonotic paramyxovirus of the genus Henipavirus. Like the phosphoprotein (P) gene of other paramyxoviruses, the P gene of NiV is predicted to encode three additional proteins, C, V and W. When the C, V and W proteins of NiV were tested for their ability to inhibit expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in plasmid-based, minigenome replication assays, each protein inhibited CAT expression in a dose-dependent manner. The C, V and W proteins of NiV also inhibited expression of CAT from a measles virus (MV) minigenome, but not from a human parainfluenzavirus 3 (hPIV3) minigenome. Interestingly, the C and V proteins of MV, which have previously been shown to inhibit MV minigenome replication, also inhibited NiV minigenome replication; however, they were not able to inhibit hPIV3 minigenome replication. In contrast, the C protein of hPIV3 inhibited minigenome replication of hPIV3, NiV and MV. Although there is very limited amino acid sequence similarity between the C, V and W proteins within the paramyxoviruses, the heterotypic inhibition of replication suggests that these proteins may share functional properties.

TI  - The Central Role of the Matrix Protein in Nipah Virus Assembly and Morphogenesis
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - Abstract : Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging paramyxovirus distinguished by its ability to cause fatal disease in both animal and human hosts. Together with Hendra virus (HeV), they comprise the genus Henipavirus in the Paramyxoviridae family. NiV and HeV are restricted to Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) containment and this has hampered progress towards examining the details of their replication and morphogenesis mechanisms. Here, recombinant gene expression systems to study NiV particle assembly and budding through the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) have been established to circumvent these obstacles. When expressed by recombinant Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA) or by plasmid vector transfection, individual NiV matrix (M), fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins were released into cell culture supernatants in a membrane associated state as determined by sucrose density gradient flotation and immunoprecipitation analysis. However, co-expression of F and G along with M revealed a shift in their distribution across the gradient, indicating association with M in VLPs.

TI  - The Exceptionally Large Genome of Hendra Virus: Support for Creation of a New Genus within the FamilyParamyxoviridae
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 74
SP  - 9972
EP  - 9979
AB  - ABSTRACT An outbreak of acute respiratory disease in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane, Australia, in September 1994 resulted in the deaths of 14 racing horses and a horse trainer. The causative agent was a new member of the family Paramyxoviridae. The virus was originally called Equine morbillivirus but was renamed Hendra virus (HeV) when molecular characterization highlighted differences between it and members of the genusMorbillivirus. Less than 5 years later, the closely relatedNipah virus (NiV) emerged in Malaysia, spread rapidly through the pig population, and caused the deaths of over 100 people. We report the characterization of the HeV L gene and protein, the genome termini, and gene boundary sequences, thus completing the HeV genome sequence. In the highly conserved region of the L protein, the HeV sequence GDNE differs from the GDNQ found in almost all other nonsegmented negative-strand (NNS) RNA viruses. HeV has an absolutely conserved intergenic trinucleotide sequence, 3‚Ä≤-GAA-5‚Ä≤, and highly conserved transcription initiation and termination sequences similar to those of respiroviruses and morbilliviruses. The large genome size (18,234 nucleotides), the unique complementary genome terminal sequences of HeV, and the limited homology with other members of theParamyxoviridae suggest that HeV, together with NiV, should be classified in a new genus in this family. The large genome of HeV also fills a gap in the spectrum of genome sizes observed with NNS RNA virus genomes. As such, it provides a further piece in the puzzle of NNS RNA virus evolution.

TI  - The Henipavirus V protein is a prevalently unfolded protein with a zinc-finger domain involved in binding to DDB1.
AB  - Henipaviruses are severe human pathogens within the Paramyxoviridae family. Beyond the P protein, the Henipavirus P gene also encodes the V protein which shares with P its N-terminal, intrinsically disordered region (PNT) and possesses a unique C-terminal domain predicted to be folded and to bind zinc (ZnFD). Henipavirus V proteins antagonize IFN signaling through PNT-mediated binding to STAT1, and several paramyxoviral V proteins promote STAT1 degradation through binding to DDB1. Structural and molecular information on Henipavirus V proteins is lacking, and their ability to interact with DDB1 has not been documented yet. We cloned the V genes from Nipah and Hendra viruses and purified the V proteins from E. coli and DDB1 from insect cells. Using analytical size-exclusion chromatography, CD and SAXS we characterized the V proteins and their domains. Using pull-down and MST we assessed their binding abilities towards DDB1. We show that PNT remains disordered also in the context of the V protein, while the ZnFD adopts a predominant Œ≤ conformation. We also show that the V proteins interact with DDB1 predominantly via their ZnFD. This is the first experimental characterization of the Henipavirus V proteins and the first experimental evidence of their interaction with DDB1. The DDB1-ZnFD interaction constitutes a promising target for antiviral strategies. These studies provide a conceptual asset to design new antiviral strategies expected to reduce or abrogate the ability of these viruses to escape the innate immune response. They also contribute to illuminating the conformational behaviour of proteins encompassing large intrinsically disordered domains.

TI  - The Immunobiology of Nipah Virus
JF  - Microorganisms
VL  - 10
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly lethal zoonotic paramyxovirus that emerged in Malaysia in 1998. It is a human pathogen capable of causing severe respiratory infection and encephalitis. The natural reservoir of NiV, Pteropus fruit bats, remains a continuous virus source for future outbreaks, although infection in the bats is largely asymptomatic. NiV provokes serious disease in various mammalian species. In the recent human NiV outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, both bats-to-human and human-to-human transmissions have been observed. NiV has been demonstrated to interfere with the innate immune response via interferon type I signaling, promoting viral dissemination and preventing antiviral response. Studies of humoral immunity in infected NiV patients and animal models have shown that NiV-specific antibodies were produced upon infection and were protective. Studies on cellular immunity response to NiV infection in human and animal models also found that the adaptive immune response, specifically CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, was stimulated upon NiV infection. The experimental vaccines and therapeutic strategies developed have provided insights into the immunological requirements for the development of successful medical countermeasures against NiV. This review summarizes the current understanding of NiV pathogenesis and innate and adaptive immune responses induced upon infection.

TI  - The Intrinsically Disordered W Protein Is Multifunctional during Henipavirus Infection, Disrupting Host Signalling Pathways and Nuclear Import
JF  - Cells
VL  - 9
AB  - Nipah and Hendra viruses are highly pathogenic, zoonotic henipaviruses that encode proteins that inhibit the host‚Äôs innate immune response. The W protein is one of four products encoded from the P gene and binds a number of host proteins to regulate signalling pathways. The W protein is intrinsically disordered, a structural attribute that contributes to its diverse host protein interactions. Here, we review the role of W in innate immune suppression through inhibition of both pattern recognition receptor (PRR) pathways and interferon (IFN)-responsive signalling. PRR stimulation leading to activation of IRF-3 and IFN release is blocked by henipavirus W, and unphosphorylated STAT proteins are sequestered within the nucleus of host cells by W, thereby inhibiting the induction of IFN stimulated genes. We examine the critical role of nuclear transport in multiple functions of W and how specific binding of importin-alpha (ImpŒ±) isoforms, and the 14-3-3 group of regulatory proteins suggests further modulation of these processes. Overall, the disordered nature and multiple functions of W warrant further investigation to understand henipavirus pathogenesis and may reveal insights aiding the development of novel therapeutics.

TI  - The Nipah Virus Fusion Protein Is Cleaved within the Endosomal Compartment*
JF  - Journal of Biological Chemistry
VL  - 280
SP  - 29899
EP  - 29903
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is a recently emerged and highly pathogenic paramyxovirus that causes a systemic infection in animals and humans and can infect a wide range of cultured cells. Interestingly, the NiV fusion (F) protein has a single arginine at the cleavage site similar to paramyxoviruses that are activated by exogenous trypsin-like enzymes only present in specific cells and tissues and therefore only cause localized infections. We show here that NiV F activation is not mediated by an exogenous serum protease but by an endogenous ubiquitous cellular protease after endocytosis of the protein. In addition to endocytosis, acidification of the endosome is a prerequisite for F cleavage. These results show that activation of the NiV F protein depends on a type of proteolytic cleavage that is clearly different from what is known for other paramyxoviral and orthomyxoviral fusion proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a viral class I fusion protein whose activation depends on clathrin-mediated constitutive endocytosis.

TI  - The Nonstructural Proteins of Nipah Virus Play a Key Role in Pathogenicity in Experimentally Infected Animals
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 5
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) P gene encodes P protein and three accessory proteins (V, C and W). It has been reported that all four P gene products have IFN antagonist activity when the proteins were transiently expressed. However, the role of those accessory proteins in natural infection with NiV remains unknown. We generated recombinant NiVs lacking V, C or W protein, rNiV(V‚àí), rNiV(C‚àí), and rNiV(W‚àí), respectively, to analyze the functions of these proteins in infected cells and the implications in in vivo pathogenicity. All the recombinants grew well in cell culture, although the maximum titers of rNiV(V‚àí) and rNiV(C‚àí) were lower than the other recombinants. The rNiV(V‚àí), rNiV(C‚àí) and rNiV(W‚àí) suppressed the IFN response as well as the parental rNiV, thereby indicating that the lack of each accessory protein does not significantly affect the inhibition of IFN signaling in infected cells. In experimentally infected golden hamsters, rNiV(V‚àí) and rNiV(C‚àí) but not the rNiV(W‚àí) virus showed a significant reduction in virulence. These results suggest that V and C proteins play key roles in NiV pathogenicity, and the roles are independent of their IFN-antagonist activity. This is the first report that identifies the molecular determinants of NiV in pathogenicity in vivo.

TI  - The Paramyxovirus Fusion Protein C-Terminal Region: Mutagenesis Indicates an Indivisible Protein Unit
AB  - ABSTRACT Paramyxoviruses enter host cells by fusing the viral envelope with a host cell membrane. Fusion is mediated by the viral fusion (F) protein, and it undergoes large irreversible conformational changes to cause membrane merger. The C terminus of PIV5 F contains a membrane-proximal 7-residue external region (MPER), followed by the transmembrane (TM) domain and a 20-residue cytoplasmic tail. To study the sequence requirements of the F protein C terminus for fusion, we constructed chimeras containing the ectodomain of parainfluenza virus 5 F (PIV5 F) and either the MPER, the TM domain, or the cytoplasmic tail of the F proteins of the paramyxoviruses measles virus, mumps virus, Newcastle disease virus, human parainfluenza virus 3, and Nipah virus. The chimeras were expressed, and their ability to cause cell fusion was analyzed. The chimeric proteins were variably expressed at the cell surface. We found that chimeras containing the ectodomain of PIV5 F with the C terminus of other paramyxoviruses were unable to cause cell fusion. Fusion could be restored by decreasing the activation energy of refolding through introduction of a destabilizing mutation (S443P). Replacing individual regions, singly or doubly, in the chimeras with native PIV5 F sequences restored fusion to various degrees, but it did not have an additive effect in restoring activity. Thus, the F protein C terminus may be a specific structure that only functions with its cognate ectodomain. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of MPER indicates that it has a regulatory role in fusion since both hyperfusogenic and hypofusogenic mutations were found.

TI  - The Role of the Host Ubiquitin System in Promoting Replication of Emergent Viruses
JF  - Viruses
VL  - 13
AB  - Ubiquitination of proteins is a post-translational modification process with many different cellular functions, including protein stability, immune signaling, antiviral functions and virus replication. While ubiquitination of viral proteins can be used by the host as a defense mechanism by destroying the incoming pathogen, viruses have adapted to take advantage of this cellular process. The ubiquitin system can be hijacked by viruses to enhance various steps of the replication cycle and increase pathogenesis. Emerging viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), flaviviruses like Zika and dengue, as well as highly pathogenic viruses like Ebola and Nipah, have the ability to directly use the ubiquitination process to enhance their viral-replication cycle, and evade immune responses. Some of these mechanisms are conserved among different virus families, especially early during virus entry, providing an opportunity to develop broad-spectrum antivirals. Here, we discuss the mechanisms used by emergent viruses to exploit the host ubiquitin system, with the main focus on the role of ubiquitin in enhancing virus replication.

TI  - The Second Receptor Binding Site of the Globular Head of the Newcastle Disease Virus Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase Activates the Stalk of Multiple Paramyxovirus Receptor Binding Proteins To Trigger Fusion
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 86
SP  - 5730
EP  - 5741
AB  - ABSTRACT The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of paramyxoviruses carries out three distinct activities contributing to the ability of HN to promote viral fusion and entry: receptor binding, receptor cleavage (neuraminidase), and activation of the fusion protein. The relationship between receptor binding and fusion triggering functions of HN are not fully understood. For Newcastle disease virus (NDV), one bifunctional site (site I) on HN‚Ä≤s globular head can mediate both receptor binding and neuraminidase activities, and a second site (site II) in the globular head is also capable of mediating receptor binding. The receptor analog, zanamivir, blocks receptor binding and cleavage activities of NDV HN‚Ä≤s site I while activating receptor binding by site II. Comparison of chimeric proteins in which the globular head of NDV HN is connected to the stalk region of either human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) or Nipah virus receptor binding proteins indicates that receptor binding to NDV HN site II not only can activate its own fusion (F) protein but can also activate the heterotypic fusion proteins. We suggest a general model for paramyxovirus fusion activation in which receptor engagement at site II plays an active role in F activation.

To understand the sequence basis of promiscuity for EFNB2 binding to the attachment glycoprotein of NiV (NiV-G) and Eph receptors, we performed deep mutagenesis on EFNB2 to identify mutations that enhance binding to NiV-G over EphB2, one of the highest affinity Eph receptors. The mutations highlight how different EFNB2 conformations are selected by NiV-G versus EphB2. Specificity mutations are enriched at the base of the G-H binding loop of EFNB2, especially surrounding a phenylalanine hinge upon which the G-H loop pivots, and at a phenylalanine hook that rotates away from the EFNB2 core to engage Eph receptors. One EFNB2 mutant, D62Q, possesses pan-specificity to the attachment glycoproteins of closely related henipaviruses and has markedly diminished binding to the six Eph receptors. However, EFNB2-D62Q has high residual binding to EphB3 and EphB4. A second deep mutational scan of EFNB2 identified combinatorial mutations to further enhance specificity to NiV-G. A triple mutant of soluble EFNB2, D62Q-Q130L-V167L, has minimal binding to Eph receptors but maintains binding, albeit reduced, to NiV-G. Soluble EFNB2 decoy receptors carrying the specificity mutations were potent neutralizers of chimeric henipaviruses. These findings demonstrate how specific residue changes at the shared binding interface of a promiscuous ligand (EFNB2) can influence selectivity for multiple receptors, and may also offer insight towards the development of henipavirus therapeutics and diagnostics. IMPORTANCE Ephrin-B2 (EFNB2) is a ligand for six Eph receptors in humans and regulates multiple cell developmental and signaling processes. It also functions as the cell entry receptor for Nipah virus and Hendra virus, zoonotic viruses that can cause respiratory and/or neurological symptoms in humans with high mortality. Here, we investigate the sequence basis of EFNB2 specificity for binding the Nipah virus attachment G glycoprotein over Eph receptors. We then use this information to engineer EFNB2 as a soluble decoy receptor that specifically binds the attachment glycoproteins of Nipah virus and other related henipaviruses to neutralize infection. These findings further mechanistic understanding of protein selectivity and may facilitate the development of diagnostics or therapeutics against henipavirus infection.

TI  - The Structural Features of Henipavirus Matrix Protein Driving Intracellular Trafficking.
JF  - Viral immunology
AB  - Henipaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that have recently emerged as zoonotic pathogens, capable of causing severe acute respiratory disease and encephalitis in humans. The prototypical henipaviruses, Hendra henipavirus and Nipah henipavirus, are a major health concern as they have high mortality rates and no currently approved human vaccine or drug therapy. Understanding the mechanisms of viral replication and pathogenicity is of critical importance for therapeutic developments. A novel target for such therapies is the Henipavirus Matrix (M) protein, a multifunctional protein that drives viral assembly and inhibits the innate immune response. These multifunctional attributes promote a complicated lifecycle: while viral replication occurs in the cytoplasm, M traffics to the nucleus, where it is ubiquitinated, for correct cellular targeting and virion packaging. In this study, we review the relationship between the structure and functions of M. In specific cases, the compatibility between structural accessibility and protein functionality is not always evident, and we highlight areas that require further investigation.

TI  - The Unstructured Paramyxovirus Nucleocapsid Protein Tail Domain Modulates Viral Pathogenesis through Regulation of Transcriptase Activity
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 92
AB  - ABSTRACT The paramyxovirus replication machinery comprises the viral large (L) protein and phosphoprotein (P-protein) in addition to the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which encapsidates the single-stranded RNA genome. Common to paramyxovirus N proteins is a C-terminal tail (Ntail). The mechanistic role and relevance for virus replication of the structurally disordered central Ntail section are unknown. Focusing initially on members of the Morbillivirus genus, a series of measles virus (MeV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) N proteins were generated with internal deletions in the unstructured tail section. N proteins with large tail truncations remained bioactive in mono- and polycistronic minireplicon assays and supported efficient replication of recombinant viruses. Bioactivity of Ntail mutants extended to N proteins derived from highly pathogenic Nipah virus. To probe an effect of Ntail truncations on viral pathogenesis, recombinant CDVs were analyzed in a lethal CDV/ferret model of morbillivirus disease. The recombinant viruses displayed different stages of attenuation ranging from ameliorated clinical symptoms to complete survival of infected animals, depending on the molecular nature of the Ntail truncation. Reinfection of surviving animals with pathogenic CDV revealed robust protection against a lethal challenge. The highly attenuated virus was genetically stable after ex vivo passaging and recovery from infected animals. Mechanistically, gradual viral attenuation coincided with stepwise altered viral transcriptase activity in infected cells. These results identify the central Ntail section as a determinant for viral pathogenesis and establish a novel platform to engineer gradual virus attenuation for next-generation paramyxovirus vaccine design. IMPORTANCE Investigating the role of the paramyxovirus N protein tail domain (Ntail) in virus replication, we demonstrated in this study that the structurally disordered central Ntail region is a determinant for viral pathogenesis. We show that internal deletions in this Ntail region of up to 55 amino acids in length are compatible with efficient replication of recombinant viruses in cell culture but result in gradual viral attenuation in a lethal canine distemper virus (CDV)/ferret model. Mechanistically, we demonstrate a role of the intact Ntail region in the regulation of viral transcriptase activity. Recombinant viruses with Ntail truncations induce protective immunity against lethal challenge of ferrets with pathogenic CDV. This identification of the unstructured central Ntail domain as a nonessential paramyxovirus pathogenesis factor establishes a foundation for harnessing Ntail truncations for vaccine engineering against emerging and reemerging members of the paramyxovirus family.

TI  - The V Protein of Tioman Virus Is Incapable of Blocking Type I Interferon Signaling in Human Cells
JF  - PLoS ONE
VL  - 8
AB  - The capacity of a virus to cross species barriers is determined by the development of bona fide interactions with cellular components of new hosts, and in particular its ability to block IFN-Œ±/Œ≤ antiviral signaling. Tioman virus (TioV), a close relative of mumps virus (MuV), has been isolated in giant fruit bats in Southeast Asia. Nipah and Hendra viruses, which are present in the same bat colonies, are highly pathogenic in human. Despite serological evidences of close contacts between TioV and human populations, whether TioV is associated to some human pathology remains undetermined. Here we show that in contrast to the V protein of MuV, the V protein of TioV (TioV-V) hardly interacts with human STAT2, does not degrade STAT1, and cannot block IFN-Œ±/Œ≤ signaling in human cells. In contrast, TioV-V properly binds to human STAT3 and MDA5, and thus interferes with IL-6 signaling and IFN-Œ≤ promoter induction in human cells. Because STAT2 binding was previously identified as a host restriction factor for some Paramyxoviridae, we established STAT2 sequence from giant fruit bats, and binding to TioV-V was tested. Surprisingly, TioV-V interaction with STAT2 from giant fruit bats is also extremely weak and barely detectable. Altogether, our observations question the capacity of TioV to appropriately control IFN-Œ±/Œ≤ signaling in both human and giant fruit bats that are considered as its natural host.

AB  - Most paramyxoviruses circumvent the IFN response by blocking IFN signaling and limiting the production of IFN by virus-infected cells. Here we report that the highly conserved cysteine-rich C-terminal domain of the V proteins of a wide variety of paramyxoviruses binds melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (mda-5) product. mda-5 is an IFN-inducible host cell DExD/H box helicase that contains a caspase recruitment domain at its N terminus. Overexpression of mda-5 stimulated the basal activity of the IFN-beta promoter in reporter gene assays and significantly enhanced the activation of the IFN-beta promoter by intracellular dsRNA. Both these activities were repressed by coexpression of the V proteins of simian virus 5, human parainfluenza virus 2, mumps virus, Sendai virus, and Hendra virus. Similar results to the reporter assays were obtained by measuring IFN production. Inhibition of mda-5 by RNA interference or by dominant interfering forms of mda-5 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN-beta promoter by dsRNA. It thus appears that mda-5 plays a central role in an intracellular signal transduction pathway that can lead to the activation of the IFN-beta promoter, and that the V proteins of paramyxoviruses interact with mda-5 to block its activity.

AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the attachment protein gene of Hendra virus, a new member of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, has been determined from cDNA clones derived from viral genomic RNA. The deduced mRNA is 2565 nucleotides long with one open reading frame encoding a protein of 604 amino acids, which is similar in size to the attachment protein of the members of the subfamily. However, the mRNA transcript is >600 nucleotides longer than others in the subfamily due to the presence of long untranslated regions at both the 5' and 3' ends. The protein is designated G because it lacks both hemagglutination and neuraminidase activities. It contains a hydrophobic transmembrane domain close to the N terminus, eight potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and 18 cysteine residues. Although the HeV G protein had low sequence homology with Paramyxovirinae members, the predicted folding pattern of its extracellular globular head was very similar to that of members of the genus Paramyxovirus, with the location of seven potential pairs of sulfide bonds absolutely conserved. On the other hand, among the seven residues known to be critical for neuraminidase activity, only one was conserved in the Hendra virus G protein compared with at least six in HN proteins of paramyxoviruses and rubulaviruses and four in H proteins of morbilliviruses. The biological significance of this finding is discussed.

AB  - IFN-antagonist function is a major determinant of pathogenicity and cross-species infection by viruses, but remains poorly defined for many potentially zoonotic viruses resident in animal species. The paramyxovirus family contains several zoonotic viruses, including highly pathogenic viruses such as Nipah virus and Hendra virus, and an increasing number of largely uncharacterized animal viruses. Here, we report the characterization of IFN antagonism by the rodent viruses J virus (JPV) and Beilong virus (BeiPV) of the proposed genus Jeilongvirus of the paramyxoviruses. Infection of cells by JPV and BeiPV was found to inhibit IFN-activated nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). However, in contrast to most other paramyxoviruses, the JPV and BeiPV V proteins did not interact with or inhibit signalling by STAT1 or STAT2, suggesting that JPV/BeiPV use an atypical V protein-independent strategy to target STATs, consistent with their inclusion in a separate genus. Nevertheless, the V proteins of both viruses interacted with melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and robustly inhibited MDA5-dependent activation of the IFN-Œ≤ promoter. This supports a growing body of evidence that MDA5 is a universal target of paramyxovirus V proteins, such that the V-MDA5 interaction represents a potential target for broad-spectrum antiviral approaches.

TI  - Third Helical Domain of the Nipah Virus Fusion Glycoprotein Modulates both Early and Late Steps in the Membrane Fusion Cascade
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - The Paramyxoviridae family includes important human and animal pathogens, such as measles, mumps, and parainfluenza viruses and the deadly henipaviruses Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses. Paramyxoviruses infect the respiratory tract and the central nervous system (CNS) and can be highly infectious. Most paramyxoviruses have a limited host range. However, the biosafety level 4 NiV and HeV are highly pathogenic and have a wide mammalian host range. Nipah viral infections result in acute respiratory syndrome and severe encephalitis in humans, leading to 40 to 100% mortality rates. The lack of licensed vaccines or therapeutic approaches against NiV and other important paramyxoviruses underscores the need to understand viral entry mechanisms. In this study, we uncovered a novel role of a third helical region (HR3) of the NiV fusion glycoprotein in the membrane fusion process that leads to viral entry. This discovery sets HR3 as a new candidate target for antiviral strategies for NiV and likely for related viruses. ABSTRACT Medically important paramyxoviruses, such as measles, mumps, parainfluenza, Nipah, and Hendra viruses, infect host cells by directing fusion of the viral and cellular plasma membranes. Upon infection, paramyxoviruses cause a second type of membrane fusion, cell-cell fusion (syncytium formation), which is linked to pathogenicity. Host cell receptor binding causes conformational changes in the attachment glycoprotein (HN, H, or G) that trigger a conformational cascade in the fusion (F) glycoprotein that mediates membrane fusion. F, a class I fusion protein, contains the archetypal heptad repeat regions 1 (HR1) and 2 (HR2). It is well established that binding of HR1 and HR2 is key to fusing viral and cellular membranes. In this study, we uncovered a novel fusion-modulatory role of a third structurally conserved helical region (HR3) in F. Based on its location within the F structure, and structural differences between its prefusion and postfusion conformations, we hypothesized that the HR3 modulates triggering of the F conformational cascade (still requiring G). We used the deadly Nipah virus (NiV) as an important paramyxoviral model to perform alanine scan mutagenesis and a series of multidisciplinary structural/functional analyses that dissect the various states of the membrane fusion cascade. Remarkably, we found that specific residues within the HR3 modulate not only early F-triggering but also late extensive fusion pore expansion steps in the membrane fusion cascade. Our results characterize these novel fusion-modulatory roles of the F HR3, improving our understanding of the membrane fusion process for NiV and likely for the related Henipavirus genus and possibly Paramyxoviridae family members.

TI  - Timing of Galectin-1 Exposure Differentially Modulates Nipah Virus Entry and Syncytium Formation in Endothelial Cells
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 89
SP  - 2520
EP  - 2529
AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV) is a deadly emerging enveloped paramyxovirus that primarily targets human endothelial cells. Endothelial cells express the innate immune effector galectin-1 that we have previously shown can bind to specific N-glycans on the NiV envelope fusion glycoprotein (F). NiV-F mediates fusion of infected endothelial cells into syncytia, resulting in endothelial disruption and hemorrhage. Galectin-1 is an endogenous carbohydrate-binding protein that binds to specific glycans on NiV-F to reduce endothelial cell fusion, an effect that may reduce pathophysiologic sequelae of NiV infection. However, galectins play multiple roles in regulating host-pathogen interactions; for example, galectins can promote attachment of HIV to T cells and macrophages and attachment of HSV-1 to keratinocytes but can also inhibit influenza entry into airway epithelial cells. Using live Nipah virus, in the present study, we demonstrate that galectin-1 can enhance NiV attachment to and infection of primary human endothelial cells by bridging glycans on the viral envelope to host cell glycoproteins. In order to exhibit an enhancing effect, galectin-1 must be present during the initial phase of virus attachment; in contrast, addition of galectin-1 postinfection results in reduced production of progeny virus and syncytium formation. Thus, galectin-1 can have dual and opposing effects on NiV infection of human endothelial cells. While various roles for galectin family members in microbial-host interactions have been described, we report opposing effects of the same galectin family member on a specific virus, with the timing of exposure during the viral life cycle determining the outcome. IMPORTANCE Nipah virus is an emerging pathogen that targets endothelial cells lining blood vessels; the high mortality rate (up to 70%) in Nipah virus infections results from destruction of these cells and resulting catastrophic hemorrhage. Host factors that promote or prevent Nipah virus infection are not well understood. Endogenous human lectins, such as galectin-1, can function as pattern recognition receptors to reduce infection and initiate immune responses; however, lectins can also be exploited by microbes to enhance infection of host cells. We found that galectin-1, which is made by inflamed endothelial cells, can both promote Nipah virus infection of endothelial cells by ‚Äúbridging‚Äù the virus to the cell, as well as reduce production of progeny virus and reduce endothelial cell fusion and damage, depending on timing of galectin-1 exposure. This is the first report of spatiotemporal opposing effects of a host lectin for a virus in one type of host cell.

TI  - Transcriptome Profiling of the Virus-Induced Innate Immune Response in Pteropus vampyrus and Its Attenuation by Nipah Virus Interferon Antagonist Functions
AB  - ABSTRACT Bats are important reservoirs for several viruses, many of which cause lethal infections in humans but have reduced pathogenicity in bats. As the innate immune response is critical for controlling viruses, the nature of this response in bats and how it may differ from that in other mammals are of great interest. Using next-generation transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-seq), we profiled the transcriptional response of Pteropus vampyrus bat kidney (PVK) cells to Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus known to elicit a strong innate immune response in mammalian cells. The Pteropus genus is a known reservoir of Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV). Analysis of the 200 to 300 regulated genes showed that genes for interferon (IFN) and antiviral pathways are highly upregulated in NDV-infected PVK cells, including genes for beta IFN, RIG-I, MDA5, ISG15, and IRF1. NDV-infected cells also upregulated several genes not previously characterized to be antiviral, such as RND1, SERTAD1, CHAC1, and MORC3. In fact, we show that MORC3 is induced by both IFN and NDV infection in PVK cells but is not induced by either stimulus in human A549 cells. In contrast to NDV infection, HeV and NiV infection of PVK cells failed to induce these innate immune response genes. Likewise, an attenuated response was observed in PVK cells infected with recombinant NDVs expressing the NiV IFN antagonist proteins V and W. This study provides the first global profile of a robust virus-induced innate immune response in bats and indicates that henipavirus IFN antagonist mechanisms are likely active in bat cells. IMPORTANCE Bats are the reservoir host for many highly pathogenic human viruses, including henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and filoviruses, and many other viruses have also been isolated from bats. Viral infections are reportedly asymptomatic or heavily attenuated in bat populations. Despite their ecological importance to viral maintenance, research into their immune system and mechanisms for viral control has only recently begun. Nipah virus and Hendra virus are two paramyxoviruses associated with high mortality rates in humans and whose reservoir is the Pteropus genus of bats. Greater knowledge of the innate immune response of P. vampyrus bats to viral infection may elucidate how bats serve as a reservoir for so many viruses.

TI  - Transcriptome Signature of Nipah Virus Infected Endothelial Cells
JF  - 
VL  - 
AB  - The highly pathogenic Nipah virus (NiV) emerged in epidemics in Malaysia in 1998. Regular outbreaks occur since then in Bangladesh and India with the high mortality rate reaching up to 90%. During the first emergence in Malaysia, the only way to contain the outbreak was culling of more than one million pigs leading to major economic issues, estimated at over US$ 100 million (Lee, 2007). Thus, NiV is considered as a potential agent of bioterrorism and is designated as priority pathogens in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NAID) Biodefense Research Agenda. Neither treatment nor vaccines are available against NiV infection, limiting thus experimentation with live virus to Biosafety level 4 (BSL4) laboratories, which require the highest level of precaution. Nipah virus infection is often associated to the development of the wide spread vasculitis but molecular basis of its pathogenicity is still largely unknown. To gain insight in the pathogenesis of this highly lethal virus we have performed analysis of virus-induced early transcriptome changes in primary endothelial cells, which are first targets of Nipah infection in humans.

TI  - Transmembrane Domain Dissociation Is Required for Hendra Virus F Protein Fusogenic Activity
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 93
AB  - The paramyxovirus Hendra virus (HeV) causes severe respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans. To develop therapeutics for HeV and related viral infections, further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying paramyxovirus fusion events. Knowledge gained in studies of the HeV fusion (F) protein may be applicable to a broad span of enveloped viruses. In this study, we demonstrate that disulfide bonds introduced between the HeV F transmembrane domains (TMDs) block fusion. Depending on the location of these disulfide bonds, HeV F can still fold properly and bind a prefusion conformation-specific antibody prior to cell disruption. These findings support our current model for HeV membrane fusion and expand our knowledge of the TMD and its role in HeV F stability and fusion promotion. ABSTRACT Hendra virus (HeV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus that utilizes a trimeric fusion (F) protein within its lipid bilayer to mediate membrane merger with a cell membrane for entry. Previous HeV F studies showed that transmembrane domain (TMD) interactions are important for stabilizing the prefusion conformation of the protein prior to triggering. Thus, the current model for HeV F fusion suggests that modulation of TMD interactions is critical for initiation and completion of conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. HeV F constructs (T483C/V484C, V484C/N485C, and N485C/P486C) were generated with double cysteine substitutions near the N-terminal region of the TMD to study the effect of altered flexibility in this region. Oligomeric analysis showed that the double cysteine substitutions successfully promoted intersubunit disulfide bond formation in HeV F. Subsequent fusion assays indicated that the introduction of disulfide bonds in the mutants prohibited fusion events. Further testing confirmed that T483C/V484C and V484C/N485C were expressed at the cell surface at levels that would allow for fusion. Attempts to restore fusion with a reducing agent were unsuccessful, suggesting that the introduced disulfide bonds were likely buried in the membrane. Conformational analysis showed that T483C/V484C and V484C/N485C were able to bind a prefusion conformation-specific antibody prior to cell disruption, indicating that the introduced disulfide bonds did not significantly affect protein folding. This study is the first to report that TMD dissociation is required for HeV F fusogenic activity and strengthens our model for HeV fusion. IMPORTANCE The paramyxovirus Hendra virus (HeV) causes severe respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans. To develop therapeutics for HeV and related viral infections, further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying paramyxovirus fusion events.

TI  - Trimeric Transmembrane Domain Interactions in Paramyxovirus Fusion Proteins
AB  - Background: Mutations in transmembrane domains can affect activity of viral fusion proteins, but little is known about potential interactions between these domains. Results: Isolated paramyxovirus fusion protein transmembrane domains interact as trimers. Conclusion: Viral fusion protein transmembrane domains self-associate. Significance: Transmembrane domain associations may regulate stability of the prefusion conformation. Paramyxovirus fusion (F) proteins promote membrane fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes, a critical early step in viral infection. Although mutational analyses have indicated that transmembrane (TM) domain residues can affect folding or function of viral fusion proteins, direct analysis of TM-TM interactions has proved challenging. To directly assess TM interactions, the oligomeric state of purified chimeric proteins containing the Staphylococcal nuclease (SN) protein linked to the TM segments from three paramyxovirus F proteins was analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium analysis in detergent and buffer conditions that allowed density matching. A monomer-trimer equilibrium best fit was found for all three SN-TM constructs tested, and similar fits were obtained with peptides corresponding to just the TM region of two different paramyxovirus F proteins. These findings demonstrate for the first time that class I viral fusion protein TM domains can self-associate as trimeric complexes in the absence of the rest of the protein. Glycine residues have been implicated in TM helix interactions, so the effect of mutations at Hendra F Gly-508 was assessed in the context of the whole F protein. Mutations G508I or G508L resulted in decreased cell surface expression of the fusogenic form, consistent with decreased stability of the prefusion form of the protein. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of TM domains containing these mutations gave higher relative association constants, suggesting altered TM-TM interactions. Overall, these results suggest that trimeric TM interactions are important driving forces for protein folding, stability and membrane fusion promotion.

TI  - Two Key Residues in EphrinB3 Are Critical for Its Use as an Alternative Receptor for Nipah Virus
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 2
AB  - EphrinB2 was recently discovered as a functional receptor for Nipah virus (NiV), a lethal emerging paramyxovirus. Ephrins constitute a class of homologous ligands for the Eph class of receptor tyrosine kinases and exhibit overlapping expression patterns. Thus, we examined whether other ephrins might serve as alternative receptors for NiV. Here, we show that of all known ephrins (ephrinA1‚ÄìA5 and ephrinB1‚ÄìB3), only the soluble Fc-fusion proteins of ephrinB3, in addition to ephrinB2, bound to soluble NiV attachment protein G (NiV-G). Soluble NiV-G bound to cell surface ephrinB3 and B2 with subnanomolar affinities (Kd = 0.58 nM and 0.06 nM for ephrinB3 and B2, respectively). Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that the relatively lower affinity of NiV-G for ephrinB3 was largely due to a faster off-rate (Koff = 1.94 √ó 10‚àí3 s‚àí1 versus 1.06 √ó 10‚àí4 s‚àí1 for ephrinB3 and B2, respectively). EphrinB3 was sufficient to allow for viral entry of both pseudotype and live NiV. Soluble ephrinB2 and B3 were able to compete for NiV-envelope-mediated viral entry on both ephrinB2- and B3-expressing cells, suggesting that NiV-G interacts with both ephrinB2 and B3 via an overlapping site. Mutational analysis indicated that the Leu‚ÄìTrp residues in the solvent exposed G‚ÄìH loop of ephrinB2 and B3 were critical determinants of NiV binding and entry. Indeed, replacement of the Tyr‚ÄìMet residues in the homologous positions in ephrinB1 with Leu‚ÄìTrp conferred NiV receptor activity to ephrinB1. Thus, ephrinB3 is a bona fide alternate receptor for NiV entry, and two residues in the G‚ÄìH loop of the ephrin B-class ligands are critical determinants of NiV receptor activity.

JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 84
SP  - 7634
EP  - 7641
AB  - ABSTRACT The highly pathogenic Nipah virus (NiV) is aerially transmitted and causes a systemic infection after entering the respiratory tract. Airway epithelia are thus important targets in primary infection. Furthermore, virus replication in the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory or urinary tract in later phases of infection is essential for virus shedding and transmission. So far, the mechanisms of NiV replication in epithelial cells are poorly elucidated. In the present study, we provide evidence that bipolar targeting of the two NiV surface glycoproteins G and F is of biological importance for fusion in polarized epithelia. We demonstrate that infection of polarized cells induces focus formation, with both glycoproteins located at lateral membranes of infected cells adjacent to uninfected cells. Supporting the idea of a direct spread of infection via lateral cell-to-cell fusion, we could identify basolateral targeting signals in the cytoplasmic domains of both NiV glycoproteins. Tyrosine 525 in the F protein is part of an endocytosis signal and is also responsible for basolateral sorting. Surprisingly, we identified a dityrosine motif at position 28/29 in the G protein, which mediates polarized targeting. A dileucine motif predicted to function as sorting signal is not involved. Mutation of the targeting signal in one of the NiV glycoproteins prevented the fusion of polarized cells, suggesting that basolateral or bipolar F and G expression facilitates the spread of NiV within epithelial cell monolayers, thereby contributing to efficient virus spread in mucosal surfaces in early and late phases of infection.

TI  - Ubiquitin-Regulated Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Trafficking of the Nipah Virus Matrix Protein Is Important for Viral Budding
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 6
AB  - Paramyxoviruses are known to replicate in the cytoplasm and bud from the plasma membrane. Matrix is the major structural protein in paramyxoviruses that mediates viral assembly and budding. Curiously, the matrix proteins of a few paramyxoviruses have been found in the nucleus, although the biological function associated with this nuclear localization remains obscure. We report here that the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of the Nipah virus matrix (NiV-M) protein and associated post-translational modification play a critical role in matrix-mediated virus budding. Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic emerging paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in humans, and is classified as a Biosafety Level 4 (BSL4) pathogen. During live NiV infection, NiV-M was first detected in the nucleus at early stages of infection before subsequent localization to the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. Mutations in the putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) found in NiV-M impaired its nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and also abolished NiV-M budding. A highly conserved lysine residue in the NLS served dual functions: its positive charge was important for mediating nuclear import, and it was also a potential site for monoubiquitination which regulates nuclear export of the protein. Concordantly, overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced NiV-M budding whereas depletion of free ubiquitin in the cell (via proteasome inhibitors) resulted in nuclear retention of NiV-M and blocked viral budding. Live Nipah virus budding was exquisitely sensitive to proteasome inhibitors: bortezomib, an FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor for treating multiple myeloma, reduced viral titers with an IC50 of 2.7 nM, which is 100-fold less than the peak plasma concentration that can be achieved in humans. This opens up the possibility of using an ‚Äúoff-the-shelf‚Äù therapeutic against acute NiV infection.

TI  - Ubiquitous Activation of the Nipah Virus Fusion Protein Does Not Require a Basic Amino Acid at the Cleavage Site
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 78
SP  - 9705
EP  - 9712
AB  - ABSTRACT Nipah virus (NiV), a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus, causes a systemic infection in vivo and is able to replicate in cultured cells of many species and organs. Such pantropic paramyxoviruses generally encode fusion (F) proteins with multibasic cleavage sites activated by furin or other ubiquitous intracellular host cell proteases. In contrast, NiV has an F protein with a single arginine (R109) at the cleavage site, as is the case with paramyxoviruses that are activated by trypsin-like proteases only present in specific cells or tissues and therefore only cause localized infections. Unlike these viruses, cleavage of the NiV F protein is ubiquitous and does not require the addition of exogenous proteases in cell culture. To determine the importance of the amino acid sequence at the NiV F protein cleavage site for ubiquitous activation, we generated NiV F proteins with mutations around R109. Surprisingly, neither the exchange of amino acids upstream of R109 nor replacement of the basic residue itself interfered with F cleavage. Thus, R109 is not essential for F cleavage and activation. Our data demonstrate that NiV F-protein activation depends on a novel type of proteolytic cleavage that has not yet been described for any other paramyxovirus F protein. NiV F activation is mediated by a ubiquitous protease that requires neither a monobasic nor a multibasic cleavage site and therefore differs from the furin- or trypsin-like proteases known to activate other ortho- and paramyxovirus fusion proteins.

AB  - An increase in cases of acute febrile encephalitis occurred in Western Malaysia between September 1998 and May 1999, and a similar illness was reported in Singapore in March 1999. Most cases occurred in males who had been exposed to pigs, or among abattoir workers, and at least 100 deaths were reported. The illness was characterized by fever and headache, followed by drowsiness and disorientation; patients with severe cases developed seizures and coma within 24 to 48 hours. Concurrently, there were also illnesses and deaths among pigs in the same region, although the symptoms predominantly involved the respiratory system, and only a few pigs had signs of neurologic disease. From a cerebral spinal fluid specimen from a human patient, Dr. Chua and colleagues were successful in isolating a virus that was morphologically identified as belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae, and is now known as Nipah virus.

TI  - Unraveling a Three-Step Spatiotemporal Mechanism of Triggering of Receptor-Induced Nipah Virus Fusion and Cell Entry
JF  - PLoS Pathogens
VL  - 9
AB  - Membrane fusion is essential for entry of the biomedically-important paramyxoviruses into their host cells (viral-cell fusion), and for syncytia formation (cell-cell fusion), often induced by paramyxoviral infections [e.g. those of the deadly Nipah virus (NiV)]. For most paramyxoviruses, membrane fusion requires two viral glycoproteins. Upon receptor binding, the attachment glycoprotein (HN/H/G) triggers the fusion glycoprotein (F) to undergo conformational changes that merge viral and/or cell membranes. However, a significant knowledge gap remains on how HN/H/G couples cell receptor binding to F-triggering. Via interdisciplinary approaches we report the first comprehensive mechanism of NiV membrane fusion triggering, involving three spatiotemporally sequential cell receptor-induced conformational steps in NiV-G: two in the head and one in the stalk. Interestingly, a headless NiV-G mutant was able to trigger NiV-F, and the two head conformational steps were required for the exposure of the stalk domain. Moreover, the headless NiV-G prematurely triggered NiV-F on virions, indicating that the NiV-G head prevents premature triggering of NiV-F on virions by concealing a F-triggering stalk domain until the correct time and place: receptor-binding. Based on these and recent paramyxovirus findings, we present a comprehensive and fundamentally conserved mechanistic model of paramyxovirus membrane fusion triggering and cell entry.

TI  - V protein, the virulence factor across the family Paramyxoviridae: a review
JF  - Asia Pacific Journal of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology
AB  - Paramyxoviridae is a family of viruses within the order Mononegavirales and comprises 14 genera; Metaavulavirus, Orthoavulavirus, Paraavulavirus, Synodonvirus, Ferlavirus, Aquaparamyxovirus, Henipavirus, Morbillivirus, Respirovirus, Jeilongvirus, Narmovirus, Salemvirus, Pararubulavirus and Orthorubulavirus. The members within this family are negative and single-stranded RNA viruses including human and animal pathogens such as measles virus (MeV), Nipah virus (NiV), mumps virus (MuV), Sendai virus (SeV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The V protein is conserved within the family and plays an essential role in viral pathogenicity. Although V proteins of many paramyxoviruses are interferon-antagonists which counteract with the host‚Äôs innate immunity, there are still differences in the mode of action of the V protein between different genera or species within the same genera. The strategies to circumvent the host interferon (IFN) pathway can be divided into three general mechanisms; degradation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) protein, inhibition of phosphorylation of the transcription factor and, inhibition of translocation of STAT proteins into the nucleus. As a result, inhibition of IFN signalling and production promotes viral replication in the host cells. This review highlights the mechanism of the paramyxoviral V protein in evading the host IFN system.

TI  - Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Phosphoprotein Dimerization Domain Is Dispensable for Virus Growth
JF  - Journal of Virology
VL  - 94
AB  - The phosphoprotein (P) is an essential and conserved component of all nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses, including some major human pathogens (e.g., rabies virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], Ebola virus, and Nipah virus). P is a modular protein with intrinsically disordered regions and folded domains that plays specific and similar roles in the replication of the different viruses and, in some cases, hijacks cell components to the advantage of the virus and is involved in immune evasion. All P proteins are multimeric, but the role of this multimerization is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the dimerization domain of VSV P is dispensable for the expression of virally encoded proteins and for virus growth in cell culture. This provides new insights into and raises questions about the functioning of the RNA-synthesizing machinery of the nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses. ABSTRACT The phosphoprotein (P) of the nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses is a multimeric modular protein that is essential for RNA transcription and replication. Despite great variability in length and sequence, the architecture of this protein is conserved among the different viral families, with a long N-terminal intrinsically disordered region comprising a nucleoprotein chaperone module, a central multimerization domain (PMD), connected by a disordered linker to a C-terminal nucleocapsid-binding domain. The P protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) forms dimers, and here we investigate the importance of its dimerization domain, PMD, for viral gene expression and virus growth. A truncated P protein lacking the central dimerization domain (PŒîMD) loses its ability to form dimers both in vitro and in a yeast two-hybrid system but conserves its ability to bind N. In a minireplicon system, the truncated monomeric protein performs almost as well as the full-length dimeric protein, while a recombinant virus harboring the same truncation in the P protein has been rescued and follows replication kinetics similar to those seen with the wild-type virus, showing that the dimerization domain of P is dispensable for viral gene expression and virus replication in cell culture. Because RNA viruses have high mutation rates, it is unlikely that a structured domain such as a VSV dimerization domain would persist in the absence of a function(s), but our work indicates that it is not required for the functioning of the RNA polymerase machinery or for the assembly of new viruses. IMPORTANCE The phosphoprotein (P) is an essential and conserved component of all nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses, including some major human pathogens (e.g., rabies virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], Ebola virus, and Nipah virus). P is a modular protein with intrinsically disordered regions and folded domains that plays specific and similar roles in the replication of the different viruses and, in some cases, hijacks cell components to the advantage of the virus and is involved in immune evasion. All P proteins are multimeric, but the role of this multimerization is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the dimerization domain of VSV P is dispensable for the expression of virally encoded proteins and for virus growth in cell culture. This provides new insights into and raises questions about the functioning of the RNA-synthesizing machinery of the nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses.

TI  - Viral Interactions with Adaptor-Protein Complexes: A Ubiquitous Trait among Viral Species
JF  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
VL  - 22
AB  - Numerous viruses hijack cellular protein trafficking pathways to mediate cell entry or to rearrange membrane structures thereby promoting viral replication and antagonizing the immune response. Adaptor protein complexes (AP), which mediate protein sorting in endocytic and secretory transport pathways, are one of the conserved viral targets with many viruses possessing AP-interacting motifs. We present here different mechanisms of viral interference with AP complexes and the functional consequences that allow for efficient viral propagation and evasion of host immune defense. The ubiquity of this phenomenon is evidenced by the fact that there are representatives for AP interference in all major viral families, covered in this review. The best described examples are interactions of human immunodeficiency virus and human herpesviruses with AP complexes. Several other viruses, like Ebola, Nipah, and SARS-CoV-2, are pointed out as high priority disease-causative agents supporting the need for deeper understanding of virus-AP interplay which can be exploited in the design of novel antiviral therapies.

TI  - Viral entry mechanisms: the increasing diversity of paramyxovirus entry
JF  - The FEBS Journal
VL  - 276
AB  - The paramyxovirus family contains established human pathogens such as the measles virus and human respiratory syncytial virus, as well as emerging pathogens including the Hendra and Nipah viruses and the recently identified human metapneumovirus. Two major envelope glycoproteins, the attachment protein and the fusion protein, promote the processes of viral attachment and virus‚Äêcell membrane fusion required for entry. Although common mechanisms of fusion protein proteolytic activation and the mechanism of membrane fusion promotion have been shown in recent years, considerable diversity exists in the family relating to receptor binding and the potential mechanisms of fusion triggering.

TI  - Virus Particle Release from Glycosphingolipid-Enriched Microdomains Is Essential for Dendritic Cell-Mediated Capture and Transfer of HIV-1 and Henipavirus
AB  - ABSTRACT Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exploits dendritic cells (DCs) to promote its transmission to T cells. We recently reported that the capture of HIV-1 by mature dendritic cells (MDCs) is mediated by an interaction between the glycosphingolipid (GSL) GM3 on virus particles and CD169/Siglec-1 on MDCs. Since HIV-1 preferentially buds from GSL-enriched lipid microdomains on the plasma membrane, we hypothesized that the virus assembly and budding site determines the ability of HIV-1 to interact with MDCs. In support of this hypothesis, mutations in the N-terminal basic domain (29/31KE) or deletion of the membrane-targeting domain of the HIV-1 matrix (MA) protein that altered the virus assembly and budding site to CD63+/Lamp-1-positive intracellular compartments resulted in lower levels of virion incorporation of GM3 and attenuation of virus capture by MDCs. Furthermore, MDC-mediated capture and transmission of MA mutant viruses to T cells were decreased, suggesting that HIV-1 acquires GSLs via budding from the plasma membrane to access the MDC-dependent trans infection pathway. Interestingly, MDC-mediated capture of Nipah and Hendra virus (recently emerged zoonotic paramyxoviruses) M (matrix) protein-derived virus-like particles that bud from GSL-enriched plasma membrane microdomains was also dependent on interactions between virion-incorporated GSLs and CD169. Moreover, capture and transfer of Nipah virus envelope glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentivirus particles by MDCs were severely attenuated upon depletion of GSLs from virus particles. These results suggest that GSL incorporation into virions is critical for the interaction of diverse enveloped RNA viruses with DCs and that the GSL-CD169 recognition nexus might be a conserved viral mechanism of parasitization of DC functions for systemic virus dissemination. IMPORTANCE Dendritic cells (DCs) can capture HIV-1 particles and transfer captured virus particles to T cells without establishing productive infection in DCs, a mechanism of HIV-1 trans infection. We have recently identified CD169-mediated recognition of GM3, a host-derived glycosphingolipid (GSL) incorporated into the virus particle membrane, as the receptor and ligand for the DC-HIV trans infection pathway. In this study, we have identified the matrix (MA) domain of Gag to be the viral determinant that governs incorporation of GM3 into HIV-1 particles, a previously unappreciated function of the HIV-1 MA. In addition, we demonstrate that the GSL-CD169-dependent trans infection pathway is also utilized as a dissemination mechanism by henipaviruses. GSL incorporation in henipaviruses was also dependent on the viral capsid (M) protein-directed assembly and budding from GSL-enriched lipid microdomains. These findings provide evidence of a conserved mechanism of retrovirus and henipavirus parasitization of cell-to-cell recognition pathways for systemic virus dissemination.
